    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it like a human would. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed. Here\u2019s how I see it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have the graphs of \\(y = h(x)\\) and \\(y = j(x)\\) intersecting at several points: \\((2, 2)\\), \\((4, 6)\\), \\((6, 12)\\), and \\((8, 12)\\). Then, we need to find a point where \\(y = h(2x)\\) and \\(y = 2j(x)\\) intersect, and determine the sum of the coordinates of that point.\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of transformations in functions\u2014scaling and stretching. Also, the fact that the original functions intersect at multiple points suggests a relationship or perhaps a system of equations could be involved.\n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure where to start, but exploring function transformations seems like a reasonable path. Let\u2019s see how that goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Function Transformations:**\n   - I could think about how scaling \\(x\\) and multiplying \\(j(x)\\) by 2 affects the graphs.\n   \n2. **Setting Up Equations:**\n   - Perhaps I can set \\(h(2x) = 2j(x)\\) and use the intersection points to find a relationship.\n\n3. **Graphical Understanding:**\n   - Visualizing the transformations might help\u2014seeing how the graphs move can provide insights.\n\n4. **Checking Symmetry or Patterns:**\n   - Maybe there\u2019s a pattern in the intersection points that could hint at the solution.\n\nLet\u2019s start with exploring **Function Transformations** and see where that leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Function Transformations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Understanding \\(h(2x)\\):** This suggests that the graph of \\(h(x)\\) is horizontally compressed by a factor of 2.\n- **Understanding \\(2j(x)\\):** This means the graph of \\(j(x)\\) is vertically stretched by a factor of 2.\n\n**Exploring \\(y = h(2x)\\):**\n- When I replace \\(x\\) with \\(2x\\) in \\(h(x)\\), the graph compresses horizontally. This means the intersection points\u2019 \\(x\\)-coordinates should be halved.\n\n**Exploring \\(y = 2j(x)\\):**\n- Multiplying \\(j(x)\\) by 2 stretches the graph vertically. The \\(y\\)-coordinates of the intersection points should be doubled.\n\n**Checking if This Makes Sense:**\n- Does compressing \\(h(x)\\) horizontally and stretching \\(j(x)\\) vertically align with finding a common intersection? It feels like adjusting both functions to align at certain points.\n\n**Idea Forming:**\n- Maybe the new point of intersection can be found by applying these transformations to the given intersection points.\n\n**But Wait:**\n- I\u2019m not sure if this directly leads to finding the new intersection point. Maybe I need to consider specific points given.\n\n**Alternative Thought:**\n- Perhaps I should directly apply these transformations to the known intersection points to find where \\(h(2x) = 2j(x)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Transformations to Known Intersection Points**\n\n**Approach:**\n- I'll take each known intersection point \\((a, b)\\) where \\(h(a) = j(b)\\) and see how they transform under \\(h(2x)\\) and \\(2j(x)\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Point \\((2, 2)\\):**\n   - \\(h(2) = j(2)\\)\n   - For \\(h(2x)\\), \\(x = 1\\) \u2192 \\(h(2 \\times 1) = h(2)\\)\n   - For \\(2j(x)\\), \\(x = 2\\) \u2192 \\(2j(2) = 2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n   - **Check:** \\(h(2) = 2 = 2j(2)\\)? Yes, \\(h(2) = 2 = 2j(2)\\).\n\n2. **Point \\((4, 6)\\):**\n   - \\(h(4) = j(6)\\)\n   - For \\(h(2x)\\), \\(x = 2\\) \u2192 \\(h(4) = 2j(6)\\)\n   - For \\(2j(x)\\), \\(x = 6\\) \u2192 \\(2j(6) = 2 \\times 6 = 12\\)\n   - **Check:** \\(h(4) = 2j(6) = 12\\)? No, because \\(h(4) = 2j(6)\\) but \\(2j(6) = 12\\) and \\(h(4) = 2j(6) = 12\\). This seems consistent.\n\n3. **Point \\((6, 12)\\):**\n   - \\(h(6) = j(12)\\)\n   - For \\(h(2x)\\), \\(x = 3\\) \u2192 \\(h(6) = 2j(12)\\)\n   - For \\(2j(x)\\), \\(x = 12\\) \u2192 \\(2j(12) = 2 \\times 12 = 24\\)\n   - **Check:** \\(h(6) = 2j(12) = 24\\)? No, but earlier we noted that \\(h(6) = 2j(12)\\).\n\n4. **Point \\((8, 12)\\):**\n   - \\(h(8) = j(12)\\)\n   - For \\(h(2x)\\), \\(x = 4\\) \u2192 \\(h(8) = 2j(12)\\)\n   - For \\(2j(x)\\), \\(x = 12\\) \u2192 \\(2j(12) = 24\\)\n   - **Check:** \\(h(8) = 2j(12) = 24\\)? No, but consistent with earlier.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Initially, it seemed like there might be inconsistencies, but upon closer inspection, the transformations align with the given points. The stretching and compressing adjustments lead to consistent values.\n\n**Realization:**\n- The transformations don\u2019t change the equality \\(h(x) = j(x)\\) at the original intersection points; they merely adjust the scale.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying the New Intersection Point**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, I need to find a point where \\(h(2x) = 2j(x)\\).\n- From the transformations, it seems like the new intersection point arises from applying \\(x \\to 2x\\) and \\(y \\to 2y\\).\n\n**Exploring \\(x = 4\\):**\n- \\(h(2 \\times 4) = h(8)\\)\n- \\(2j(4) = 2 \\times 6 = 12\\)\n\n**Check:**\n- Is \\(h(8) = 12\\)? According to the points given, \\(h(8) = j(12)\\).\n- Also, from earlier, \\(j(12) = 12\\), so \\(h(8) = 12\\).\n\n**Insight:**\n- Thus, \\(h(8) = 2j(4) = 12\\), which satisfies \\(h(2x) = 2j(x)\\) at \\(x = 4\\).\n\n**But Wait:**\n- This suggests \\(x = 4\\) is the point of intersection. But checking multiple points, it seems like \\(x = 4\\) leads to \\(y = 12\\), so maybe there\u2019s another point.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n- Perhaps the point of intersection is not just \\(x = 4\\), but considering multiple transformations, maybe higher orders or different scales are involved.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Rechecking, only \\(x = 4\\) aligns perfectly with both transformed functions.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Based on the transformations, \\(x = 4\\) and \\(y = 12\\) is the point where \\(h(2x) = 2j(x)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Confirming the Coordinates**\n\n**Coordinates:**\n- The point of intersection is \\((4, 12)\\).\n\n**Sum of Coordinates:**\n- \\(4 + 12 = 16\\).\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Does \\(h(8) = 12\\)? Yes, from the given points, \\(h(8) = j(12)\\) and \\(j(12) = 12\\).\n- Is \\(2j(4) = 12\\)? Yes, since \\(j(4) = 6\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The transformations lead us to the point where the new graphs intersect, and the sum of the coordinates checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Starting with function transformations helped identify the relationship between \\(h(x)\\) and \\(j(x)\\).\n- **Strategy Shift:** Initially thought multiple intersection points were possible, but focusing on specific transformations clarified the single point.\n- **Mistake Acknowledgment:** Almost got sidetracked by considering multiple solutions, but reapplying transformations kept it on track.\n- **Confirmation:** Multiple checks ensured the point and its coordinates were correct.\n\nIn summary, by exploring function transformations and applying them to known intersection points, we identified that the graphs of \\(y = h(2x)\\) and \\(y = 2j(x)\\) intersect at \\((4, 12)\\), and the sum of the coordinates is \\(16\\).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThrough brainstorming and exploring different strategies, I applied function transformations to the given intersection points. Initially, considering multiple solutions led to some confusion, but focusing on specific transformations clarified that the graphs intersect at \\((4, 12)\\). Subsequent checks confirmed the correctness, leading to the sum of the coordinates being \\(16\\). This step-by-step reflection and adjustment ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",
