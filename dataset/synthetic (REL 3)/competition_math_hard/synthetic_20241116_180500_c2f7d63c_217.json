    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, thinking through it just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approaches, check my work frequently, and adjust as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the function \\( j(x) = \\frac{1}{x+8} + \\frac{1}{x^2+8} + \\frac{1}{x^3+8} \\), I notice it's a sum of rational functions. **Rational functions** are something I've dealt with before, so I think back to what I know:\n\n- **Domain Issues:** Usually, the domain of a rational function is all real numbers except where the denominator is zero. That makes sense here too.\n\nBut wait, there are multiple terms with different powers of \\( x \\). Does this complicate things? Hmm, maybe. Each term might have its own restriction on the domain.\n\nI'm wondering if:\n\n- I need to identify where each denominator equals zero.\n- Perhaps combining the constraints from all three terms would give me the complete domain.\n\nAt this point, it looks like identifying the values that **make the denominators zero** is crucial. But I'm not entirely sure if there's a simpler way by looking for common factors or something else.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Identify Zeros of Each Denominator:** \n   - Find \\( x + 8 = 0 \\)\n   - Find \\( x^2 + 8 = 0 \\)\n   - Find \\( x^3 + 8 = 0 \\)\n\n   This seems straightforward\u2014remove all \\( x \\) values that make any denominator zero.\n\n2. **Analyze Polynomial Equations:**\n   - For \\( x^2 + 8 \\) and \\( x^3 + 8 \\), I recall that they don't factor easily with real numbers. Maybe I can leverage that.\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Consider sketching the function to visually identify undefined points. But I probably wouldn't have time for that in an exam setting.\n\n4. **Look for Common Solutions:**\n   - Perhaps some solutions overlap between the different equations, which could simplify things.\n\nReflecting on these, the first strategy\u2014**identifying zeros of each denominator**\u2014seems the most direct. Let's start with that and see where it leads.\n\n### **Step 1: Finding Zeros of Each Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nOkay, let's tackle each denominator one by one:\n\n1. **For \\( x + 8 = 0 \\):**\n   - Solving this is straightforward: \\( x = -8 \\).\n\n2. **For \\( x^2 + 8 = 0 \\):**\n   - This looks different. I remember that \\( x^2 \\) can't be negative for real numbers, except when combined with the \\( +8 \\).\n   - So, \\( x^2 = -8 \\).\n   - Taking square roots: \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{-8} = \\pm 2i\\sqrt{2} \\).\n   - Wait, these are **imaginary** solutions. But we're looking for real number domains, so maybe these don't affect us directly.\n\n3. **For \\( x^3 + 8 = 0 \\):**\n   - Solving this: \\( x^3 = -8 \\).\n   - Taking the cube root: \\( x = -2 \\).\n   - Cube roots can affect real-valued functions, so this is a real number we've got to consider.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI found three critical points:\n\n- \\( x = -8 \\) from the first term.\n- \\( x = -2 \\) from the third term.\n- Imaginary solutions from the second term, which don't impact the real domain directly.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nDoes it make sense that only \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) are relevant? Yes, because we're dealing with real functions, and imaginary solutions don't affect the domain in the real number system.\n\n### **Step 2: Combining the Restrictions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to determine how these points affect the overall domain of \\( j(x) \\).\n\n- **\\( x = -8 \\):** This makes the first denominator zero, so \\( x = -8 \\) is **not** in the domain.\n- **\\( x = -2 \\):** This makes the third denominator zero, so \\( x = -2 \\) is also **not** in the domain.\n- The imaginary solutions don't affect the real domain, so we can ignore them.\n\nBut wait, are there any other values that might cause issues? I should consider if there's overlap between these points or if other numbers need to be excluded.\n\n**Thinking Deeper:**\n\nEvery rational function has its own set of restrictions, and in this case, each term has a distinct denominator that doesn't seem to share roots with the others (besides the common reality that they all can't be zero at once, which is impossible here).\n\nSo, it looks like I only need to exclude \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) from the domain. \n\n**Checking:**\n\nDoes excluding just these two points cover all potential issues? Given that each denominator is a separate polynomial requiring its own solution, yes, excluding these points is sufficient.\n\n### **Step 3: Expressing the Domain as a Union of Intervals**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I've identified the problematic points, I can express the domain in interval notation, excluding \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\).\n\nSo, the domain includes all real numbers except \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\).\n\n**Breaking It Down:**\n\n- All real numbers less than \\( -8 \\): \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\)\n- All real numbers between \\( -8 \\) and \\( -2 \\): \\( (-8, -2) \\)\n- All real numbers greater than \\( -2 \\): \\( (-2, \\infty) \\)\n\nBut wait, should \\( -8 \\) and \\( -2 \\) be included in any interval? No, because at these points, the function is **undefined**.\n\n**Final Expression:**\n\nThe domain is the union of these intervals:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, -2) \\cup (-2, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes. Excluding \\( -8 \\) and \\( -2 \\) ensures that all denominators are non-zero, thus covering the entire real line except for these points.\n\n### **Step 4: Double-Checking the Work**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me double-check:\n\n- Did I miss any points where the denominator could be zero?\n- Is there any overlap or additional restrictions I overlooked?\n\nChecking again, I see that:\n\n- \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) are the only points making any denominator zero.\n- The imaginary solutions don't affect the real domain.\n- There's no other intersection or overlapping constraints between the terms.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\nWait a minute, could there be hidden restrictions from the **composition** of terms? For example, is there a value that makes both \\( x + 8 \\) and \\( x^3 + 8 \\) zero simultaneously? But reflecting on it, such a value doesn't exist because \\( x + 8 = 0 \\) implies \\( x = -8 \\), and \\( x^3 + 8 = 0 \\) implies \\( x = -2 \\). These are distinct points.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNo additional restrictions are needed. The domain is correctly expressed as excluding only \\( -8 \\) and \\( -2 \\).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe domain of the function is:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, -2) \\cup (-2, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nLooking back, starting with identifying the zeros of each denominator was the right approach. By systematically addressing each term, I ensured that all problematic points were accounted for without missing any hidden restrictions. Checking along the way confirmed the correctness of each step, leading to a confident and accurate final expression for the domain.",
