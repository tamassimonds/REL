    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process as naturally as possible, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's begin by really understanding what's being asked.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see that \\( f(x) = x^k \\) with \\( k > 0 \\). We're asked to find the **range** of this function on the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of studying exponential and power functions. I recall that functions like \\( x^k \\) behave differently based on the value of \\( k \\). For instance, if \\( k = 1 \\), it's a linear function; if \\( k > 1 \\), it's a curve that increases more steeply; and if \\( 0 < k < 1 \\), it's a concave curve.\n\n- **Confusion:** I'm not entirely sure how to find the range directly. Do I just evaluate the endpoints, or is there more to it? Maybe I need to consider the behavior of the function as \\( x \\) approaches infinity.\n\n- **Exploring Ideas:** I think I could:\n  1. Examine the behavior of \\( f(x) \\) at specific points like \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = \\infty \\).\n  2. Consider whether the function is increasing or decreasing over the interval.\n  3. Look into whether \\( f(x) \\) has a minimum or maximum within \\([1, \\infty)\\).\n  \n  Let me start by exploring these strategies one by one.\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluating at the Endpoint \\( x = 1 \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Since \\( x = 1 \\) is the lower bound of the interval, calculating \\( f(1) \\) seems like a good starting point.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  f(1) = 1^k = 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Okay, so at the lower endpoint, the function value is 1. This could be the minimum value in the range, but I'd better check if there's a minimum elsewhere in the interval.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the Behavior as \\( x \\to \\infty \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Now, let's see what happens to \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) increases without bound. Does it grow indefinitely? Does it reach a particular value?\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} x^k = \\infty \\quad (\\text{since } k > 0)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** As \\( x \\) approaches infinity, \\( f(x) \\) also goes to infinity. That makes sense because for any \\( k > 0 \\), raising \\( x \\) to the power of \\( k \\) will yield larger and larger values as \\( x \\) increases.\n\n- **Check:** This suggests that the range might start at 1 and go up to infinity. But before concluding, I should verify whether there are any maximum or minimum points in the interval.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing the Function's Monotonicity**\n\n- **Thought Process:** To determine if there's a minimum or maximum within the interval, I should check if the function is increasing or decreasing.\n\n- **Strategy:** Since \\( f(x) = x^k \\) where \\( k > 0 \\), I remember that power functions are monotonic. Specifically:\n  - If \\( k > 1 \\), the function is **increasing**.\n  - If \\( 0 < k < 1 \\), the function is **decreasing**.\n\n- **Application:**\n  - **For \\( k > 1 \\):** The function increases from \\( f(1) = 1 \\) to \\( f(x) \\to \\infty \\) as \\( x \\to \\infty \\).\n  - **For \\( 0 < k < 1 \\):** The function decreases from \\( f(1) = 1 \\) to \\( f(x) \\to \\infty \\) as \\( x \\to \\infty \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait a minute, this seems counterintuitive. If \\( k < 1 \\), shouldn't the function decrease? Let me double-check.\n\n- **Realization:** Ah, I see the mistake. For \\( 0 < k < 1 \\), the function **increases** from \\( f(1) = 1 \\) to \\( f(x) \\to \\infty \\) as \\( x \\to \\infty \\). This is because roots (which are less than 1) of numbers greater than 1 yield larger values.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Regardless of the value of \\( k \\) (as long as \\( k > 0 \\)), the function is **increasing** on the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Finalizing the Range**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Given that the function is increasing and we've determined its behavior at the endpoints, the range seems to start at 1 and extend to infinity. To be sure, I should consider whether there's any point in the interval where the function doesn't reach a certain value.\n\n- **Check:** Since the function is continuous and increasing, every value between \\( f(1) \\) and \\( f(\\infty) \\) is covered.\n\n- **Verification:**\n  - At \\( x = 1 \\), \\( f(1) = 1 \\).\n  - As \\( x \\to \\infty \\), \\( f(x) \\to \\infty \\).\n  - The function is increasing, so all values greater than 1 are achieved.\n\n- **Final Conclusion:** The range of \\( f(x) \\) on the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\) is \\([1, \\infty)\\).\n\n### **Step 5: Reflecting on the Approach**\n\n- **Satisfaction Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, the function covers all values from 1 to infinity as \\( x \\) increases.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Initially, I thought about exploring maximum and minimum points, but realizing the function is increasing simplified the process.\n\n- **Potential Mistake:** Initially, I hesitated about the monotonicity of the function for \\( k < 1 \\), but correcting that led me to the correct range.\n\n- **Learning:** It's crucial to confirm the behavior of power functions based on the exponent \\( k \\).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe range of \\( f(x) = x^k \\) on the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\) is \\([1, \\infty)\\).\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step approach, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and verification, helped ensure that the correct range was determined. It also highlighted the importance of understanding the behavior of power functions based on their exponents.",

  "ground_truth": "Because $k > 0$, $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ increases without bound.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values greater than or equal to 1, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{[1,\\infty)}$."
