    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a natural thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect frequently, check my work often, and adjust my approach as needed. Let\u2019s start by fully understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**User Query:**  \nFind the shortest distance between the point \\((6,12)\\) and the parabola given by the equation \\(x = \\frac{y^2}{2}\\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  This looks like a geometry problem involving finding the shortest distance between a point and a curve. I recall similar problems where minimizing the distance between a point and a curve is involved.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**  \n  1. **Minimize the Distance Function:**  \n     Create a distance function between the point and any point on the parabola, then minimize it.\n\n  2. **Use Calculus (Derivatives):**  \n     After setting up the distance function, use derivatives to find the minimum distance.\n\n  3. **Geometric Considerations:**  \n     Analyze the geometry of the parabola and the given point to see if there's a more intuitive solution.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  The first two strategies seem related and perhaps go hand-in-hand. The third might provide a quick check or a simpler path if applicable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI'll start by setting up the distance function, as it seems like a straightforward approach. If this gets too complicated, I\u2019ll reconsider and perhaps look for geometric insights or simplifications.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Distance Function**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Objective:**  \n  Find the shortest distance between the point \\((6,12)\\) and any point \\((x,y)\\) on the parabola \\(x = \\frac{y^2}{2}\\).\n\n- **Distance Formula:**  \n  The distance \\(D\\) between two points is given by:  \n  \\[\n  D = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n  \\]  \n  Here, \\((x_1, y_1) = (6, 12)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2) = (x, y)\\).\n\n- **Substituting the Parabola Equation:**  \n  Since \\(x = \\frac{y^2}{2}\\), I can express \\(D\\) in terms of \\(y\\):  \n  \\[\n  D(y) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{y^2}{2} - 6\\right)^2 + (y - 12)^2}\n  \\]  \n  This way, the distance depends only on \\(y\\).\n\n**Checking:**  \nWait, does it make sense to minimize \\(D(y)\\) directly? The square root might complicate things. Perhaps minimizing \\(D^2(y)\\) would be easier, as the square root function is monotonic.\n\n**Action:**  \nI\u2019ll proceed by minimizing \\(D^2(y)\\) to avoid dealing with the square root. This should simplify the calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing the Square of the Distance**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Distance Squared:**  \n  \\[\n  D^2(y) = \\left(\\frac{y^2}{2} - 6\\right)^2 + (y - 12)^2\n  \\]  \n\n- **Expanding \\(D^2(y)\\):**  \n  Let\u2019s expand both terms to simplify:  \n  \\[\n  D^2(y) = \\left(\\frac{y^4}{4} - 6y^2 + 36\\right) + \\left(y^2 - 24y + 144\\right)\n  \\]  \n  Combining like terms:  \n  \\[\n  D^2(y) = \\frac{y^4}{4} + \\left(-6y^2 + y^2\\right) + (36 + 144) - 24y  \n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  D^2(y) = \\frac{y^4}{4} - 5y^2 + 180 - 24y\n  \\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat looks reasonable. By minimizing \\(D^2(y)\\), we'll find the \\(y\\) that gives the shortest distance squared, which corresponds to the shortest distance.\n\n**Action:**  \nI\u2019ll continue by taking the derivative of \\(D^2(y)\\) with respect to \\(y\\) to find the minimum.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Minimum Using Calculus**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Derivative of \\(D^2(y)\\):**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{d}{dy} D^2(y) = y^3 - 10y - 24\n  \\]  \n  I derived this by differentiating each term:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{d}{dy} \\left(\\frac{y^4}{4}\\right) = y^3, \\quad \\frac{d}{dy} (-5y^2) = -10y, \\quad \\frac{d}{dy} (-24y) = -24\n  \\]  \n\n- **Setting the Derivative to Zero:**  \n  To find critical points:  \n  \\[\n  y^3 - 10y - 24 = 0\n  \\]  \n  This is a cubic equation.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nCubic equations can be tricky. Let's see if there\u2019s a way to factor or if I need to use synthetic division or the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Possible Rational Roots:**  \n  According to the Rational Root Theorem, potential roots are factors of \\(-24\\) over factors of \\(1\\): \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b14, \u00b16, \u00b18, \u00b112, \u00b124.\n\n- **Testing \\(y = 4\\):**  \n  Let's check if \\(y = 4\\) is a root:  \n  \\[\n  4^3 - 10(4) - 24 = 64 - 40 - 24 = 0  \n  \\]  \n  **Wait, that worked!** \\(y = 4\\) is a root.\n\n**Action:**  \nSince \\(y = 4\\) is a root, I\u2019ll use synthetic division to factor the cubic equation and find other possible roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Factoring the Cubic Equation**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Synthetic Division with \\(y = 4\\):**  \n  Let\u2019s divide \\(y^3 - 10y - 24\\) by \\(y - 4\\):  \n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n  4 & 1 & 0 & -10 & -24 \\\\\n    &   & 4 & 16 & 24 \\\\\n  \\hline\n    & 1 & 4 & 6 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]  \n  The quotient is \\(y^2 + 4y + 6\\), and the remainder is 0, confirming \\(y = 4\\) is a root.\n\n- **Factored Form:**  \n  \\[\n  y^3 - 10y - 24 = (y - 4)(y^2 + 4y + 6)\n  \\]  \n  So,  \n  \\[\n  y^2 + 4y + 6 = 0\n  \\]  \n  Let's solve for \\(y\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe quadratic \\(y^2 + 4y + 6 = 0\\) doesn't have real roots (discriminant is negative). So, \\(y = 4\\) is the only real solution.\n\n**Action:**  \nI\u2019ll proceed with \\(y = 4\\) as the point on the parabola that minimizes the distance.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Corresponding \\(x\\) on the Parabola**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Using the Parabola Equation:**  \n  Given \\(x = \\frac{y^2}{2}\\), substitute \\(y = 4\\):  \n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{4^2}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n  \\]  \n  So, the point on the parabola is \\((8, 4)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat makes sense. Now I have the point \\((8, 4)\\) on the parabola that is closest to \\((6, 12)\\).\n\n**Action:**  \nI\u2019ll calculate the distance between these two points to find the shortest distance.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Shortest Distance**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Distance Formula:**  \n  \\[\n  D = \\sqrt{(8 - 6)^2 + (4 - 12)^2}\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  D = \\sqrt{2^2 + (-8)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 64} = \\sqrt{68} = 2\\sqrt{17}\n  \\]  \n\n**Checking:**  \nWait, does \\(2\\sqrt{17}\\) seem reasonable? Let\u2019s see...  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.123, \\quad \\text{so } 2 \\times 4.123 \\approx 8.246\n\\]  \n**Reflection:**  \nYeah, that\u2019s a reasonable distance. The calculations check out.\n\n**Action:**  \nFinalize the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe shortest distance between the point \\((6, 12)\\) and the parabola \\(x = \\frac{y^2}{2}\\) is \\(2\\sqrt{17}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Approach Validity:**  \n  Starting with setting up the distance function and minimizing it using calculus was a solid strategy. Considering \\(D^2(y)\\) instead of \\(D(y)\\) helped simplify the problem by eliminating the square root.\n\n- **Root Finding:**  \n  Successfully finding \\(y = 4\\) as the real root made the problem manageable. Factoring the cubic equation led to identifying the only real solution.\n\n- **Distance Calculation:**  \n  Calculating the distance with the derived points confirmed the result. The numeric value aligns logically with the coordinates involved.\n\n- **Potential Mistake Checks:**  \n  At each step, reflecting on the appropriateness of methods and checking intermediate results ensured accuracy. The quadratic having no real roots besides \\(y = 4\\) was verified.\n\n- **Geometric Insight:**  \n  Understanding the parabola's orientation and the given point's coordinates helped anticipate the solution's nature, providing confidence in the calculated distance.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe solution process was methodical, starting with brainstorming, followed by systematic problem-solving, and ending with verification. The shortest distance found is \\(2\\sqrt{17}\\).",
