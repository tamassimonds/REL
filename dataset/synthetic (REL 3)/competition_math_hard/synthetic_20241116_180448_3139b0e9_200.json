I'll take you through my brain process, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way, just like you'd expect from a human thinking through a math problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nOkay, so the problem is asking for the values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the inequality \\( x^2 - 2x > 35 \\). I need to express the solution in interval notation.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nIn inequalities involving quadratic expressions, I recall that finding the points where the expression equals the threshold (in this case, 35) can help determine the ranges where the inequality holds true. This reminds me of solving quadratics by finding their roots.\n\n**Initial Strategy:**  \n- **Step 1:** Set the inequality to an equation to find the boundary points: \\( x^2 - 2x = 35 \\).\n- **Step 2:** Solve this equation to find the critical points.\n- **Step 3:** Use these points to test intervals and determine where the original inequality holds.\n\nBut wait, let me consider if there's a faster method or a potential pitfall.\n\n### **Reflection:**  \nIs setting the equation equal to 35 the best approach?  \n- **Thoughts:** This seems like a standard method, but maybe there's a quicker way if I can factor the quadratic easily. Let's see if factoring works.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**  \nPerhaps I can rearrange the inequality to make it more recognizable for factoring.\n\n### **Step 2: Rearranging the Inequality**\n\n**Action:**  \nLet's move 35 to the left side to set the inequality to zero:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 2x - 35 > 0 \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nNow, the inequality looks like a standard quadratic inequality. This reminds me of quadratic equations that can be factored.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Option 1:** Factor the quadratic expression to find the roots.\n- **Option 2:** Use the quadratic formula if factoring isn't straightforward.\n\n**Checking:**  \nLet's try to factor \\( x^2 - 2x - 35 \\) first.\n\n### **Step 3: Attempting to Factor the Quadratic**\n\n**Action:**  \nLook for two numbers that multiply to \\(-35\\) (the constant term) and add to \\(-2\\) (the coefficient of \\( x \\)).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Possible Factors of \\(-35\\):**  \n  - \\( 1 \\times -35 \\)  \n  - \\( -1 \\times 35 \\)  \n  - \\( 5 \\times -7 \\)  \n  - \\( -5 \\times 7 \\)  \n\n- **Checking Sums:**  \n  - \\( 1 + (-35) = -34 \\) \u2192 Doesn't match.\n  - \\( -1 + 35 = 34 \\) \u2192 Doesn't match.\n  - \\( 5 + (-7) = -2 \\) \u2192 **Bingo!**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI can factor the quadratic as:\n\n\\[ (x - 7)(x + 5) > 0 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, let me double-check this factoring.\n\n**Quick Verification:**  \nExpanding \\( (x - 7)(x + 5) \\):\n\n\\[ x^2 + 5x - 7x - 35 = x^2 - 2x - 35 \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nYes, the expansion matches the original quadratic. So, factoring seems correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Inequality**\n\n**Action:**  \nNow, I need to determine where \\( (x - 7)(x + 5) > 0 \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nAn inequality like this can be solved by finding the roots and testing the sign of the product in each interval determined by these roots.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \n- **Step 1:** Identify the roots: \\( x - 7 = 0 \\) and \\( x + 5 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -5 \\).\n- **Step 2:** These roots divide the number line into three intervals: \\( (-\\infty, -5) \\), \\( (-5, 7) \\), and \\( (7, \\infty) \\).\n- **Step 3:** Test a point from each interval to see where the inequality holds.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes this testing method make sense?  \n- **Check:** Yes, it's a standard approach for quadratic inequalities.\n\n### **Step 5: Testing the Intervals**\n\n**Interval 1:**  \n**Test Point:** \\( x = -6 \\) (in \\( (-\\infty, -5) \\))  \n\\[ (-6 - 7)(-6 + 5) = (-13)(-1) = 13 \\]  \n**Result:** Positive \u2192 Inequality holds.\n\n**Interval 2:**  \n**Test Point:** \\( x = 0 \\) (in \\( (-5, 7) \\))  \n\\[ (0 - 7)(0 + 5) = (-7)(5) = -35 \\]  \n**Result:** Negative \u2192 Inequality does not hold.\n\n**Interval 3:**  \n**Test Point:** \\( x = 8 \\) (in \\( (7, \\infty) \\))  \n\\[ (8 - 7)(8 + 5) = (1)(13) = 13 \\]  \n**Result:** Positive \u2192 Inequality holds.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the inequality \\( x^2 - 2x > 35 \\) holds for \\( x \\) in the intervals \\( (-\\infty, -5) \\) and \\( (7, \\infty) \\).\n\n### **Step 6: Expressing the Solution in Interval Notation**\n\n**Action:**  \nCombine the two intervals where the inequality holds.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThe solution set includes all \\( x \\) less than or equal to \\(-5\\) and greater than or equal to \\( 7 \\).\n\n**Interval Notation:**  \n\\[ (-\\infty, -5) \\cup (7, \\infty) \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, do I include the endpoints \\( -5 \\) and \\( 7 \\)?  \n- **Check:** The original inequality is strict (\\( > \\)), meaning the endpoints are not included.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[ (-\\infty, -5) \\cup (7, \\infty) \\]\n\n### **Quick Final Check:**\n\n- **Factoring Correctness:**  \n  Factored correctly as \\( (x - 7)(x + 5) > 0 \\).\n\n- **Interval Testing:**  \n  Tested points correctly in each interval.\n\n- **Endpoint Inclusion:**  \n  Endpoints excluded since the inequality is strict.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe solution in interval notation is \\( (-\\infty, -5) \\cup (7, \\infty) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**  \n   Recognized the need to solve a quadratic inequality.\n\n2. **Exploring Strategies:**  \n   Considered factoring the quadratic and testing sign changes across intervals.\n\n3. **Factoring Attempt:**  \n   Successfully factored the quadratic expression.\n\n4. **Inequality Resolution:**  \n   Determined where the factored expression is positive by testing intervals.\n\n5. **Interval Notation:**  \n   Expressed the solution set in proper interval notation, ensuring endpoints were handled correctly.\n\n6. **Reflection and Checking:**  \n   Regularly checked each step for correctness, confirming that the approach was valid and the final answer was accurate.\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting as needed\u2014I arrived at the correct solution. This human-like thinking process, with its natural flow of ideas, doubts, and confirmations, ensured a thorough and accurate answer.",

  "ground_truth": "After moving the constant over, we get a quadratic expression and solve for the roots: \\begin{align*}\nx^2-2x-35&>0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(x-7)(x+5)&>0.\n\\end{align*} The quadratic expression equals 0 at $x=7$ and $x=-5$, meaning it changes sign at each root. Now we look at the sign of the quadratic when $x<-5$, when $-5<x<7$, and when $x>7$. When $x<-5$, $(x-7)$ and $(x+5)$ are both negative, so the product is positive. When $-5<x<7$, $(x+5)$ becomes positive, while $(x-7)$ remains negative - the product is negative. When $x>7$, both factors are positive, so the product is positive. So, $(x-7)(x+5)>0$ when $x<-5$ or $x>7$, which means our answer in interval notation is $\\boxed{(-\\infty, -5) \\cup (7, \\infty)}$.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, so a graph of $(x-7)(x+5)=0$ would open up. When there are two distinct roots, the shape of the parabola means that product is negative when $x$ is between the roots and positive when $x$ is less than both roots or greater than both roots."
