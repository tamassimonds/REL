Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **User Query:**\nThe polynomial \\( P(x) = 2x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) has the property that the mean of its zeros, the product of its zeros, and the sum of the coefficients are all equal. The \\( y \\)-intercept of the graph of \\( y = P(x) \\) is 8. What is \\( b \\)?\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, looking at this problem, there are a few key pieces of information:\n\n1. **Polynomial Form:** \\( P(x) = 2x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\)\n2. **Mean of Zeros, Product of Zeros, and Sum of Coefficients are Equal**\n3. **\\( y \\)-Intercept is 8**\n\nInitially, I remember that for a cubic polynomial, the **mean of the zeros** and the **product of the zeros** have specific relationships governed by Vieta's formulas. Also, the **sum of the coefficients** relates to the polynomial evaluated at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nBut honestly, I'm feeling a bit unsure about how to connect all these properties right away. Let me brainstorm how I can approach this.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use Vieta\u2019s Formulas:**\n   - Mean of zeros: Sum of zeros divided by 3.\n   - Product of zeros: For a cubic, it's the constant term divided by the leading coefficient (but with a sign change depending on the degree).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\( P(1) \\) to Find the Sum of Coefficients:**\n   - Since the sum of coefficients is given, perhaps setting \\( x = 1 \\) could help.\n\n3. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Conditions:**\n   - Create equations where the mean, product, and sum of coefficients are equal.\n\n4. **Use the \\( y \\)-Intercept:**\n   - Knowing \\( P(0) = c = 8 \\), this can help simplify our equations.\n\nThinking about it, combining Vieta's formulas with the condition that the mean and product of zeros are equal to the sum of coefficients seems like a solid starting point. Let's proceed with this approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Apply Vieta\u2019s Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nVieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its zeros. For a cubic polynomial:\n\n- **Sum of Zeros (\\( \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma \\)):** \n  \\[\n  -\\frac{a}{2} \\quad \\text{(since the leading coefficient is 2)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Product of Zeros (\\( \\alpha \\beta \\gamma \\)):** \n  \\[\n  -\\frac{c}{2} \\quad \\text{(again, with a sign change because it's degree 3)}\n  \\]\n\n**First Check:**  \nWait, I'm not using the mean of zeros directly yet. Let's calculate it too:\n\n- **Mean of Zeros:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma}{3} = \\frac{-a/2}{3} = -\\frac{a}{6}\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Reflection:**  \nSo, the mean of zeros is \\( -\\frac{a}{6} \\). I'll need this later.\n\n**Integer Constraint:**  \nNoticing that \\( a \\) must be an integer since the mean of zeros and the product of zeros must equal the sum of coefficients, which are integers.\n\nHow does this help? Let's see. If \\( c = 8 \\), then the product of zeros is \\( -\\frac{8}{2} = -4 \\).\n\nBut I still need to connect this with the mean of zeros and the sum of coefficients being equal.\n\n**Reading Instructions Again:**  \nI realize I need to find \\( b \\), so maybe there's a direct relationship I\u2019m missing.\n\nLet's proceed with setting up equations based on the given conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Conditions**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFrom the problem statement, the mean of the zeros, the product of the zeros, and the sum of the coefficients are all equal. Let's set up these relationships as equations.\n\n1. **Mean of Zeros Equals Sum of Coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{a}{6} = P(1)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Product of Zeros Equals Sum of Coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   -4 = P(1)\n   \\]\n\n**But Wait:**  \nThese two equations suggest that \\( -\\frac{a}{6} = -4 \\), which would imply \\( a = 24 \\). This seems too straightforward, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nPerhaps the mean of zeros is not directly equal to the sum of coefficients, but rather to the sum of the coefficients at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nLet me revisit the problem statement to clarify.\n\n**Clarification:**  \nThe mean of the zeros, the product of the zeros, and the sum of the coefficients are all equal. So:\n\n- Mean of Zeros = Sum of Coefficients\n- Product of Zeros = Sum of Coefficients\n\nThis implies:\n\n- Mean of Zeros = Product of Zeros\n\n**New Set of Equations:**\n\n1. **Mean of Zeros:**\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{a}{6}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Product of Zeros:**\n   \\[\n   -4\n   \\]\n\n**Immediate Insight:**  \nIf the mean of zeros equals the product of zeros, then:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{a}{6} = -4\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{6} = 4 \\implies a = 24\n\\]\n\n**Spontaneous Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? If \\( a = 24 \\), then the mean of zeros is \\( -\\frac{24}{6} = -4 \\), which matches the product of zeros. Also, we haven't used the \\( y \\)-intercept yet, which could serve as a check.\n\n**Next Step:**  \nWith \\( a = 24 \\), let's see if we can find \\( b \\) using the other conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Relate the Sum of Coefficients to \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe know that the sum of coefficients is:\n\n\\[\nP(1) = 2 + a + b + c\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( c = 8 \\) and \\( a = 24 \\), let's substitute these values:\n\n\\[\nP(1) = 2 + 24 + b + 8 = 34 + b\n\\]\n\nEarlier, we established that \\( P(1) = -4 \\). So:\n\n\\[\n34 + b = -4\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( b \\):**\n\n\\[\nb = -4 - 34 = -38\n\\]\n\n**Quick Reflection:**  \nThis calculation suggests that \\( b = -38 \\). Let me check if this aligns with all the given conditions.\n\n**Consistency Check:**\n\n- **Mean of Zeros:**  \n  \\[\n  -\\frac{a}{6} = -\\frac{24}{6} = -4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Product of Zeros:**  \n  \\[\n  -4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Sum of Coefficients:**  \n  \\[\n  P(1) = 2 + 24 + (-38) + 8 = -4\n  \\]\n\nAll three conditions are satisfied:\n\n- Mean of zeros = Product of zeros = Sum of coefficients = **\\-4**\n\n**Final Check:**  \nEverything checks out. The conditions given in the problem are met with \\( a = 24 \\) and \\( b = -38 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies, applying Vieta's formulas, and setting up and solving equations based on the given conditions, I find that:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-38}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( b \\) is **\\(-38\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflecting on the Process:**\n\nThroughout the process, I:\n\n- **Explored Multiple Approaches:** Initially considered Vieta's formulas and evaluating \\( P(1) \\), which led to setting up equations.\n  \n- **Checked My Work Regularly:** After solving for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), I verified that all conditions were satisfied.\n\n- **Adapted My Strategy:** When the mean of zeros equaled the product of zeros, I realized I could directly solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n- **Ensured Consistency:** By back-substituting values, I confirmed that all given properties of the polynomial were intact.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant reflection and checking, ensured that the solution was correct and aligned with the problem's requirements.",

  "ground_truth": "The $y$-intercept of the graph is the point at which $x=0$. At that point, $P(x)=c$, which we are told is equal to 8. Thus, $c=8$. The product of the roots of the given polynomial is $-\\frac{c}{2}=-4$. The problem states that the mean of the zeros must also equal $-4$, so the sum of the three zeros (this is a cubic equation) is equal to $3 \\cdot -4 = -12$. The sum of the zeros is also equal to $-\\frac{a}{2}$, so $a=24$. Finally, we are given that the sum of the coefficients, or $2+ a+b+c$, is also equal to $-4$. Plugging in our known values of $a$ and $c$, we have $2+24+b+8=-4$. Solving for $b$, we get $b=\\boxed{-38}$."
