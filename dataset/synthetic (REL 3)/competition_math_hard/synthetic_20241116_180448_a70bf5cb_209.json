    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem. I'll walk you through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, checking my work often, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would tackle it in real life.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, it reminds me of geometric transformations, specifically reflections. I remember dealing with reflections about the line \\(y = x\\) before, but I'm not entirely sure how to apply it to the circle's center coordinates.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Reflection over \\(y = x\\):** I faintly recall that reflecting a point across this line swaps its \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates. So, for a point \\((a, b)\\), the reflection would be \\((b, a)\\).\n- **Check if This Applies:** But does this rule apply directly to the center of the circle? What exactly happens to the center when the entire circle is reflected?\n- **Alternative Thoughts:** Maybe there's a more general rule for reflecting geometric shapes. Could the entire circle's position be determined by just reflecting its center?\n\nAt this point, I'm leaning towards the idea that reflecting the center will give me the new coordinates. But I need to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Application of Reflection Rule:**\n   - Apply the known rule for reflecting a point across \\(y = x\\): Switch the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates.\n   \n2. **Visualizing the Transformation:**\n   - Sketching or visualizing how the circle and its center move during the reflection.\n\n3. **Using Mathematical Definitions:**\n   - Looking up the definition of reflection in a coordinate plane to confirm the rule.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The first strategy seems straightforward\u2014apply the reflection rule directly. But to be more confident, maybe combining it with a visualization would help.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Reflection Rule**\n\nGiven the center of the circle at \\((6, -5)\\):\n\n- According to the reflection rule for \\(y = x\\):\n  \\[\n  (x, y) \\rightarrow (y, x)\n  \\]\n  \n  So, reflecting \\((6, -5)\\):\n  \\[\n  (-5, 6)\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Wait, does this make sense? By swapping, I get \\((-5, 6)\\). On the surface, it seems correct because that's how reflection over \\(y = x\\) is defined.\n\nBut let me dig deeper.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Validating the Approach**\n\n**Does Reflecting the Center Give the Correct Result?**\n\nThinking about it, when I reflect the center, I'm assuming the entire circle follows suit. But is that always the case?\n\n- **Moment of Doubt:** What if there's a nuance about reflecting the entire shape versus just the center?\n- **Reassurance:** However, reflecting the center should suffice because the circle is symmetrical in all directions. The center's reflection determines the new position of the circle.\n\n**Alternative Insight:**\n- If I consider that every point on the circle undergoes the same reflection as the center, then finding the center's image is indeed enough.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Visualizing the Transformation**\n\n**Sketching the Idea:**\n\n- **Original Circle:** Center at \\((6, -5)\\), radius \\(r\\).\n- **Reflected Circle:** Center at \\((-5, 6)\\), same radius \\(r\\).\n\n**Observation:**\n- The new center \\((-5, 6)\\) lies at an equal distance from the line \\(y = x\\) as the original center, confirming the reflection.\n\n**Checking:**\n- This matches my earlier calculation. The reflection seems consistent with the geometric properties.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification**\n\n**Doing a Quick Check:**\n\n- **Original Center:** \\((6, -5)\\)\n- **Reflected Center:** \\((-5, 6)\\)\n\nDoes reflecting \\((6, -5)\\) indeed land me at \\((-5, 6)\\)?\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - Swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\): From \\((6, -5)\\) to \\((-5, 6)\\).\n  \n**Confirmation:**\n- The calculation aligns with the reflection rule. It checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying each step, I\u2019m confident that the center of the image circle is at:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-5, 6)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Initial Hesitation:** I wasn\u2019t sure if reflecting just the center was enough, but visualizing and checking reassured me.\n- **Learning Point:** It\u2019s crucial to validate each step, especially when applying geometric rules, to ensure accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, by applying the reflection rule, validating through visualization, and consistently checking my work, I arrived at the correct coordinates for the center of the image circle.",
