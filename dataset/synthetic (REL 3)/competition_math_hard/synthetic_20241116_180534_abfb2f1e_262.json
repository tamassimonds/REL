    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem and tackle it like a human would\u2014thinking through different strategies, reflecting often, and checking our work to ensure we're on the right track. I'll start by brainstorming different approaches, exploring each step thoroughly, and being open to changing strategies if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the problem states:\n\n**\"The area of a rectangle is 432 square centimeters. What would the new area be if the length of the rectangle was decreased by 10% and the width was increased by 10%? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\"**\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Familiar Concept:** This reminds me of percentage changes in dimensions affecting area. I've encountered similar problems before, where adjusting length and width impacts the overall area differently.\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  - **Calculate New Dimensions:** Find the new length and width after the percentage changes and then calculate the new area.\n  - **Use Area Relationship:** Maybe there's a way to relate the percentage changes directly to the area without calculating new dimensions.\n  - **Grid or Visual Approach:** Visualizing how the rectangle changes could help, but that might be more abstract.\n  \n**Possible Next Steps:**\n1. **Calculate New Dimensions:** Start by finding the new length and width.\n2. **Compute New Area:** Multiply the new dimensions to get the new area.\n3. **Check if Simplification is Possible:** See if there's a more straightforward way to calculate the new area using area relationships.\n\n**Wait...** Before jumping into calculations, let me reflect: **Is calculating the new dimensions individually the most efficient route?** Maybe there's a quicker way by leveraging how the area changes when both dimensions are adjusted.\n\n**New Approach:** **Use the Relationship Between Area and Dimensions Post-Percentage Changes.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Percentage Changes in Length and Width**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Decreasing Length by 10%:** This means the new length is 90% of the original length.\n- **Increasing Width by 10%:** This means the new width is 110% of the original width.\n- **Key Insight:** Percentage decreases and increases can be combined multiplicatively to find the effect on the area.\n\n**Checking This Approach:**\n- **Multiplicative Effect:** I recall from previous problems that when both dimensions are adjusted by percentages, the new area can be found by multiplying the area by the product of these percentage changes.\n- **Sounds Right:** This seems like a more streamlined way than calculating new dimensions separately.\n\n**Action:** **Proceed with Calculating the Combined Percentage Change on the Area.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Combined Percentage Change**\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Combined Percentage Change:** \n  \\[\n  \\text{New Area} = \\text{Original Area} \\times \\left(\\frac{90}{100} \\times \\frac{110}{100}\\right)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{New Area} = 432 \\times 0.9 \\times 1.1\n  \\]\n  \n  **Simplifying Step-by-Step:**\n  \\[\n  0.9 \\times 1.1 = 0.99\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  432 \\times 0.99 = 427.68\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Checking the Calculation:** \n  - Multiplying 432 by 0.9 (which is a decrease by 10%) gives 388.8.\n  - Then, multiplying 388.8 by 1.1 (increase by 10%) results in 427.68.\n- **Quick Check:** Does 427.68 seem reasonable compared to the original area of 432?\n  - **Thought:** It's slightly less than the original, which makes sense since the length decreased and the width increased.\n\n**Wait...** **Does it always work like this?** I recall that the product of percentage increases and decreases results in a slight decrease overall due to the multiplicative effect. **So, yes, it's correct.**\n\n**Conclusion for Step 2:** The new area is **427.68 square centimeters**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Rounding to the Nearest Whole Number**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Requirement:** Express the answer to the nearest whole number.\n- **Action:** Round 427.68 to the nearest integer.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Rounding:** \n  \\[\n  427.68 \\approx 428\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Checking Rounding:** Since the decimal is 0.68, it rounds up to 428.\n- **Does It Make Sense?** Rounding makes sense here as the problem asks for the nearest whole number.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 3:** The new area is **428 square centimeters**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Everything Adds Up**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Double-Checking Calculations:** Let's verify each step briefly to ensure accuracy.\n- **Step 2 Calculation:** \n  - \\( 432 \\times 0.9 = 388.8 \\)\n  - \\( 388.8 \\times 1.1 = 427.68 \\)\n- **Rounding in Step 3:** \n  - 427.68 rounds to 428.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Original Area:** 432 cm\u00b2\n- **New Area After Adjustments:** 428 cm\u00b2\n- **Comparison:** The new area is slightly less than the original, which aligns with the expected outcome since the length decreased while the width increased.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does Everything Make Sense?** Yes, the approach worked well, and the final answer is consistent with the expected impact of the percentage changes on the area.\n\n**Final Answer:** **The new area is 428 square centimeters.**\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approaches and Their Reflection**\n\n**Alternative Approach 1: Calculating New Dimensions Separately**\n\n- **Method:** Find the new length and width individually, then multiply to find the new area.\n  \n  **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{New Length} = \\text{Original Length} \\times 0.9\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{New Width} = \\text{Original Width} \\times 1.1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{New Area} = \\text{New Length} \\times \\text{New Width}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Reflection:**\n  - **Time-Consuming:** This method requires knowing the original length and width, which aren't provided directly (only the area is given).\n  - **Lacks Efficiency:** Since the area is known, using percentage changes directly on the area is more efficient.\n\n**Alternative Approach 2: Using Algebraic Expressions**\n\n- **Method:** Express the area in terms of length and width, apply percentage changes, and solve for the new area.\n  \n  **Equation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = 432\n  \\]\n  \n  **Reflection:**\n  - **Complexity:** This introduces unnecessary complexity since we already have the area.\n  - **Not Needed:** The initial approach is simpler and more direct.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- **Best Approach:** Using the relationship between percentage changes and the area directly is the most straightforward method.\n- **Alternative Approaches:** While possible, they complicate the problem without adding value.\n\n---\n\n### **Takeaways**\n\n- **Think Strategically:** At first, considering multiple methods helped identify the most efficient approach.\n- **Check and Reflect Often:** Regularly checking calculations ensured accuracy and built confidence in the solution.\n- **Be Open to Changing Direction:** Initially contemplating different strategies led to recognizing a more straightforward path.\n- **Emulate Human Thinking:** Writing out thoughts, doubts, and reflections made the problem-solving process more transparent and aligned with natural human problem-solving.\n\nThe final answer is **428** square centimeters, reflecting the new area after the specified percentage adjustments to the rectangle's dimensions.",
