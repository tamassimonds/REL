    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I\u2019ll share my brainstorming, reflections, and any adjustments I need to make along the way. Let's see how it goes!\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + \\sin^2 2x + \\sin^2 3x + \\sin^2 4x = 2\n\\]\n\nand the goal of reducing it to:\n\n\\[\n\\cos ax \\cos bx \\cos cx = 0\n\\]\n\nfor some positive integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), my initial reaction is that this involves trigonometric identities and perhaps some clever transformations.\n\n### **Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Trigonometric Identities:** I remember that sin\u00b2 and cos\u00b2 are related through \\(\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\\). Maybe I can express sin\u00b2 in terms of cos\u00b2?\n  \n- **Product-to-Sum Formulas:** These might help convert products of cosines into sums, which could be useful.\n  \n- **Sum-to-Product Formulas:** Similarly, these might convert sums into products, potentially simplifying the equation.\n\n- **Symmetry or Patterns:** Looking at the multiples of \\(x\\), perhaps there's a pattern or symmetry that can be exploited.\n\nHonestly, at this point, I'm not entirely sure which path will lead to a solution, so I\u2019ll explore a few different strategies and see what works.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Attempting to Use Trigonometric Identities**\n\n### **Trying to Express sin\u00b2 in Terms of cos\u00b2**\n\nI know the identity:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\theta = 1 - \\cos^2 \\theta\n\\]\n\nMaybe I can apply this to each sin\u00b2 term:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^2 2x = 1 - \\cos^2 2x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^2 3x = 1 - \\cos^2 3x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^2 4x = 1 - \\cos^2 4x\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n(1 - \\cos^2 x) + (1 - \\cos^2 2x) + (1 - \\cos^2 3x) + (1 - \\cos^2 4x) = 2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n4 - (\\cos^2 x + \\cos^2 2x + \\cos^2 3x + \\cos^2 4x) = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\cos^2 x + \\cos^2 2x + \\cos^2 3x + \\cos^2 4x = 2\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection: Does This Help?**\n\nWait a minute\u2014this doesn\u2019t seem to get us any closer to expressing the equation as a product of cosines. I was hoping to simplify it into a form involving cosines multiplied together, but now I have a sum of cos\u00b2 terms instead. \n\nThis approach doesn't seem fruitful, so let\u2019s explore another strategy.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Exploring Product-to-Sum Formulas**\n\n### **Thinking About Converting Sums to Products**\n\nI recall that product-to-sum formulas can convert products of cosines into sums, but since our equation involves sums of squares, I'm not sure how to directly apply these here.\n\nAlternatively, sum-to-product formulas could convert sums of cosines into products, but again, our equation doesn\u2019t fit that form directly.\n\n### **Alternative Idea: Use Multiple Angle Identities**\n\nMaybe I can use multiple angle identities to express higher sine terms in terms of lower ones. For example:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 2x = 2 \\sin x \\cos x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin 3x = 3 \\sin x - 4 \\sin^3 x \n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin 4x = 2 \\sin 2x \\cos 2x = 4 \\sin x \\cos^3 x - 4 \\sin^3 x \\cos x \n\\]\n\nBut substituting all these into the original equation seems messy and complex.\n\n### **Reflection: Is This the Right Path?**\n\nThis seems too convoluted and might lead to a very messy algebraic expression. It\u2019s not immediately clear how this would simplify to a product of cosines equal to zero. I think I should look for a different approach that might be more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Looking for Patterns and Symmetry**\n\n### **Noticing Patterns in the Angles**\n\nThe equation involves sine squares of multiples of \\(x\\): \\(x, 2x, 3x, 4x\\). Perhaps there's a pattern or symmetry among these terms that can be utilized.\n\n### **Considering the Sum of Squares of Sines**\n\nWe know that for any angle \\(\\theta\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\theta \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nSo, each term \\(\\sin^2 kx\\) (where \\(k\\) is an integer) is between 0 and 1. Therefore, their sum being equal to 2 suggests that some of these terms must be equal to 1.\n\n### **Hypothesis: Some sin\u00b2 Terms are Equal to 1**\n\nIf \\(\\sin^2 kx = 1\\), then \\(\\sin kx = \\pm 1\\), meaning \\(kx\\) is an odd multiple of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n### **Checking Possible Solutions**\n\nLet\u2019s assume:\n\n- \\(\\sin x = 1\\) or \\(\\sin x = -1\\): This means \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\\) (for \\(n\\) an integer).\n  \n- \\(\\sin 2x = 1\\) or \\(\\sin 2x = -1\\): This means \\(2x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi\\), so \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{m\\pi}{2}\\).\n  \n- Similarly for \\(\\sin 3x\\) and \\(\\sin 4x\\).\n\n### **Reflection: Are There Common Solutions?**\n\nWait\u2014there's a conflict here. For example, if \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), then:\n\n- \\(\\sin^2 x = 1\\)\n- \\(\\sin^2 2x = \\sin^2 \\pi = 0\\)\n- \\(\\sin^2 3x = \\sin^2 \\frac{3\\pi}{2} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\sin^2 4x = \\sin^2 2\\pi = 0\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\sin^2 x + \\sin^2 2x + \\sin^2 3x + \\sin^2 4x = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2\\), which satisfies the equation. \n\nBut \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) also satisfies \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\\), leading to multiple possible solutions. \n\nThis suggests that there are infinitely many \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation, each corresponding to a different set of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n### **Possible Insight: Expressing as a Product of Cosines**\n\nPerhaps we can reduce this sum of squares to a product involving cosines, as suggested by the problem. Let's see if there's a transformation that can help.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Exploring the Idea of Using Multiple Angles**\n\n### **Thinking About Combining Sine Terms**\n\nMaybe I can combine the sine terms using multiple angle formulas to see if they can be expressed as a single cosine product.\n\n### **Using the Identity for sines of Multiple Angles**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 2x = 2 \\sin x \\cos x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin 3x = 3 \\sin x - 4 \\sin^3 x \n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin 4x = 2 \\sin 2x \\cos 2x = 4 \\sin x \\cos^3 x - 4 \\sin^3 x \\cos x \n\\]\n\nBut substituting these into the original equation seems to complicate things further, making it harder to see how to factor it into a product of cosines.\n\n### **Reflection: Is This Leading Anywhere?**\n\nHonestly, this is getting messy, and I'm not seeing a clear path forward. Perhaps there's another approach that's more straightforward, so I think I need to pivot.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Considering Sum-to-Product Formulas**\n\n### **Trying to Express the Sum as a Product**\n\nI recall that:\n\n\\[\n\\cos A + \\cos B = 2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nAnd similarly for sine terms. However, our equation involves squares of sine terms, which don't directly fit this formula.\n\n### **Alternative Idea: Factorization**\n\nMaybe I can factor the sum of squares somehow. The sum of squares can sometimes be related to products, but I'm not immediately seeing a direct application here.\n\n### **Reflection: Is There a Pattern I\u2019m Missing?**\n\nRight now, I'm not sure how to proceed with sum-to-product formulas or factorization. Since this doesn't seem helpful, I'll need to think of another strategy.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Looking for a Transformational Approach**\n\n### **Thinking About Transforming the Equation**\n\nWhat if I try to transform the equation into a product form directly? Perhaps using trigonometric transformations or identities that relate sums to products.\n\n### **Exploring the Product of Cosines**\n\nOne possible transformation is to express the sum of squares as a zero-product of cosines. I know that:\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = 0 \\Rightarrow \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\n\\]\n\nTherefore, if the product of certain cosines equals zero, at least one of them must be zero.\n\n### **Trying to Express the Sum as a Zero-Product**\n\nLet\u2019s see if we can rearrange the sum to equal zero by expressing it as a product of cosines:\n\n\\[\n\\cos ax \\cos bx \\cos cx = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection: Does This Help?**\n\nThis is an interesting idea, but I'm not immediately clear on how to convert the sum of sine squares directly into such a product. I think I need to explore this further.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 7: Analyzing the Sum of Sine Squares**\n\n### **Examining the Sum of Sine Squares**\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + \\sin^2 2x + \\sin^2 3x + \\sin^2 4x = 2\n\\]\n\nEach \\(\\sin^2 kx\\) is between 0 and 1, so the maximum possible sum is 4 (if each \\(\\sin kx\\) were 1). Since the sum equals 2, it implies that certain sine squares must be 1 while others are 0.\n\n### **Possible Solution Points**\n\nAs earlier considered:\n\n- \\(\\sin^2 x = 1\\) implies \\(\\sin x = \\pm 1\\), so \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\\).\n- \\(\\sin^2 2x = 1\\) implies \\(2x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi\\), so \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{m\\pi}{2}\\).\n- Similarly for \\(\\sin^2 3x\\) and \\(\\sin^2 4x\\).\n\n### **Identifying Common Solutions**\n\nLet\u2019s find common \\(x\\) that satisfy these conditions:\n\n- For \\(\\sin^2 x = 1\\): \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\\).\n- For \\(\\sin^2 2x = 1\\): \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{m\\pi}{2}\\).\n- For \\(\\sin^2 3x = 1\\): \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\frac{p\\pi}{3}\\).\n- For \\(\\sin^2 4x = 1\\): \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{8} + \\frac{q\\pi}{4}\\).\n\n### **Finding \\(x\\) That Satisfies All Conditions**\n\nLet\u2019s see if there\u2019s an \\(x\\) that satisfies all these equations simultaneously:\n\n1. \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\\)\n2. \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{m\\pi}{2}\\)\n3. \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\frac{p\\pi}{3}\\)\n4. \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{8} + \\frac{q\\pi}{4}\\)\n\n### **Attempting to Solve for \\(x\\)**\n\nLet\u2019s try to find a common \\(x\\):\n\n- From (1): \\(n = 0\\) gives \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n  \n- From (2): For \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(m = 0\\) gives \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + 0 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\).\n  \n- From (3): For \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(p = 0\\) gives \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\n  \n- From (4): For \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), \\(q = 0\\) gives \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{8}\\).\n\n### **Reflection: Is This Consistent?**\n\nWait, this leads to contradictions because \\(x\\) cannot simultaneously be different values (\\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\)). This suggests that I can\u2019t find a single \\(x\\) that satisfies all conditions simultaneously. Instead, it implies that the equation has multiple solutions depending on the specific values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n### **Conclusion from This Approach**\n\nThis suggests that the sum of sine squares equals 2 when certain sine terms are equal to 1 while others are 0. It also implies that there are multiple sets of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) that can satisfy the equation, leading to different possible values of \\(a + b + c\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 8: Seeking a General Solution**\n\n### **Thinking About Generalizing the Solution**\n\nSince there are multiple possible solutions, perhaps I can find a general form for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) that accounts for all possible cases.\n\n### **Considering Symmetry in the Angles**\n\nLooking at the original equation, there seems to be symmetry in the multiples of \\(x\\). Perhaps this can be leveraged to find a general solution.\n\n### **Hypothesis: Expressing as a Product of Cosines with Specific Multiples**\n\nMaybe I can express the sum as a product of cosines where the angles are specific multiples of \\(x\\). For example:\n\n\\[\n\\cos ax \\cos bx \\cos cx = 0\n\\]\n\nBut I need to identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n### **Possible Insight: Utilizing the Identity for Product of Cosines**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n\\cos A \\cos B \\cos C = \\frac{1}{4} [\\cos(A+B+C) + \\cos(A+B-C) + \\cos(A-B+C) + \\cos(A-B-C)]\n\\]\n\nBut this might be too complicated to apply directly here.\n\n### **Reconsidering the Approach**\n\nThis seems to be veering off course, so let\u2019s pivot again.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 9: Leveraging Multiple Angle Identities More Effectively**\n\n### **Reattempting with Multiple Angle Identities**\n\nPerhaps I can apply multiple angle identities in a more systematic way to relate the sum of sine squares to a product of cosines.\n\n### **Recalling Multiple Angle Formulas**\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 2x = 2 \\sin x \\cos x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin 3x = 3 \\sin x - 4 \\sin^3 x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin 4x = 2 \\sin 2x \\cos 2x = 4 \\sin x \\cos^3 x - 4 \\sin^3 x \\cos x\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s substitute these into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + \\sin^2 2x + \\sin^2 3x + \\sin^2 4x = 2\n\\]\n\nbecomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + (2 \\sin x \\cos x)^2 + (3 \\sin x - 4 \\sin^3 x)^2 + (4 \\sin x \\cos^3 x - 4 \\sin^3 x \\cos x)^2 = 2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + 4 \\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x + (9 \\sin^2 x - 24 \\sin^4 x + 16 \\sin^6 x) + (16 \\sin^2 x \\cos^6 x - 32 \\sin^4 x \\cos^2 x + 16 \\sin^6 x \\cos^2 x) = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\sin^2 x + 4 \\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x + 9 \\sin^2 x - 24 \\sin^4 x + 16 \\sin^6 x + 16 \\sin^2 x \\cos^6 x - 32 \\sin^4 x \\cos^2 x + 16 \\sin^6 x \\cos^2 x = 2\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[\n(1 + 4 \\cos^2 x + 9) \\sin^2 x + (16 \\cos^6 x - 24 \\cos^2 x + 16 \\cos^2 x) \\sin^4 x + 0 \\cdot \\sin^6 x = 2\n\\]\n\nWait, this is getting complicated and messy. I\u2019m not seeing a clear path to factor this into a product of cosines. Let me rethink this approach.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 10: Shifting Strategy to Simpler Identities**\n\n### **Considering Pythagorean Identities**\n\nPerhaps I can leverage the identity \\( \\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1 \\) to simplify the equation.\n\n### **Expressing All Terms in Terms of Sine Squares**\n\nLet\u2019s express all cosine terms in terms of sine squares:\n\n\\[\n\\cos^2 kx = 1 - \\sin^2 kx\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + (1 - \\sin^2 2x) + (1 - \\sin^2 3x) + (1 - \\sin^2 4x) = 2\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + (1 - \\sin^2 2x) + (1 - \\sin^2 3x) + (1 - \\sin^2 4x) = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + \\sin^2 2x + \\sin^2 3x + \\sin^2 4x + 4 - (\\sin^2 2x + \\sin^2 3x + \\sin^2 4x) = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + 4 - (\\sin^2 2x + \\sin^2 3x + \\sin^2 4x) = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + 4 - 2 = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + 2 = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection: Is This the Correct Path?**\n\nThis simplifies to \\(\\sin^2 x = 0\\), which means \\(x = n\\pi\\) (where \\(n\\) is an integer). \n\nBut wait, this doesn't satisfy the original equation because, for \\(x = n\\pi\\), the sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 n\\pi + \\sin^2 2n\\pi + \\sin^2 3n\\pi + \\sin^2 4n\\pi = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \\neq 2\n\\]\n\nSo, this path leads to a contradiction. It suggests that there\u2019s an error in the simplification process.\n\n### **Identifying the Mistake**\n\nLooking back, I see that the substitution of \\( \\cos^2 kx = 1 - \\sin^2 kx \\) doesn't directly help in simplifying the sum to reach the desired product form. \n\n---\n\n## **Step 11: Rethinking the Approach**\n\n### **Considering Factoring Trigonometric Equations**\n\nMaybe instead of trying to simplify the sum directly, I can think about factoring both sides of the equation to see if they can be set equal to a product of cosines.\n\n### **Attempting to Factor the Sum of Sine Squares**\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\theta = \\frac{1 - \\cos 2\\theta}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, perhaps I can express the sum in terms of cosines:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x = \\frac{1 - \\cos 2x}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^2 2x = \\frac{1 - \\cos 4x}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^2 3x = \\frac{1 - \\cos 6x}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^2 4x = \\frac{1 - \\cos 8x}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 - \\cos 2x}{2} + \\frac{1 - \\cos 4x}{2} + \\frac{1 - \\cos 6x}{2} + \\frac{1 - \\cos 8x}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n(1 - \\cos 2x) + (1 - \\cos 4x) + (1 - \\cos 6x) + (1 - \\cos 8x) = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n4 - (\\cos 2x + \\cos 4x + \\cos 6x + \\cos 8x) = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n-\\cos 2x - \\cos 4x - \\cos 6x - \\cos 8x = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos 2x + \\cos 4x + \\cos 6x + \\cos 8x = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection: Is This a Step Forward?**\n\nNow, we have an equation involving the sum of cosines. This might be closer to the desired product form. Let\u2019s see if we can express this sum as a product of cosines.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 12: Utilizing Sum-to-Product Formulas**\n\n### **Applying Sum-to-Product Formulas**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n\\cos A + \\cos B = 2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nI can apply this formula repeatedly to reduce the sum of cosines into products. Let\u2019s see how this works.\n\n### **Combining Cosines Pairwise**\n\nFirst, combine \\(\\cos 2x\\) and \\(\\cos 8x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\cos 2x + \\cos 4x + \\cos 6x + \\cos 8x = [\\cos 2x + \\cos 8x] + [\\cos 4x + \\cos 6x]\n\\]\n\nApplying the sum-to-product formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos 2x + \\cos 8x = 2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{2x + 8x}{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{2x - 8x}{2}\\right) = 2 \\cos 5x \\cos 3x\n\\]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[\n\\cos 4x + \\cos 6x = 2 \\cos 5x \\cos x\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\cos 2x + \\cos 4x + \\cos 6x + \\cos 8x = 2 \\cos 5x \\cos 3x + 2 \\cos 5x \\cos x = 2 \\cos 5x (\\cos 3x + \\cos x)\n\\]\n\n### **Applying the Sum-to-Product Formula Again**\n\nNow, apply the sum-to-product formula to \\(\\cos 3x + \\cos x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\cos 3x + \\cos x = 2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{3x + x}{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{3x - x}{2}\\right) = 2 \\cos 2x \\cos x\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\cos 2x + \\cos 4x + \\cos 6x + \\cos 8x = 2 \\cos 5x (2 \\cos 2x \\cos x) = 4 \\cos 5x \\cos 2x \\cos x\n\\]\n\n### **Equating to Zero**\n\nNow, setting this equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n4 \\cos 5x \\cos 2x \\cos x = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\cos 5x \\cos 2x \\cos x = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection: Is This the Desired Form?**\n\nYes, the equation is now in the form:\n\n\\[\n\\cos ax \\cos bx \\cos cx = 0\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 2\\), and \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, \\(a + b + c = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\\).\n\n### **Final Check: Does This Make Sense?**\n\nLet\u2019s quickly verify if this transformation is correct:\n\n- **Original equation:** \\(\\sin^2 x + \\sin^2 2x + \\sin^2 3x + \\sin^2 4x = 2\\)\n- **Transformed equation:** \\(\\cos 5x \\cos 2x \\cos x = 0\\)\n\nThis transformation seems logical because:\n\n- The sum of sine squares equals a constant (\\(2\\)) suggests that certain sine terms are equal to \\(\\pm 1\\).\n- Each \\(\\cos kx = 0\\) corresponds to \\(kx\\) being an odd multiple of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), which aligns with the original equation having sine terms equal to \\(\\pm 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the approach appears correct, and the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014starting with trigonometric identities, attempting to use product-to-sum formulas, and eventually leveraging sum-to-product formulas\u2014I was able to transform the original equation into the desired product form. This process involved reflecting on each step, identifying when an approach wasn\u2019t working, and pivoting to a different method until reaching the solution.\n\nAlong the way, checking the consistency of transformations ensured the final answer was accurate. In this case, the successful transformation led to \\(a + b + c = 8\\), completing the problem.",
