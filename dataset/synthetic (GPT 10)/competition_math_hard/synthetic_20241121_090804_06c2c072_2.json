  "problem": "Suppose $f$ and $g$ are polynomials, and that $h(x)=f(g(x))+g(x)$.  Find the degree of $g(x)$ given that the degree of $h(x)$ is $6$ and the degree of $f(x)$ is $2$.",
  "solution": "To determine the degree of \\( g(x) \\) in the equation \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\), where the degrees of \\( h(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\) are known, we follow these logical steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( \\deg(g) = d \\).\n   - Given that \\( \\deg(f) = 2 \\), the degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\) will be \\( 2d \\) since the degree of a composition of polynomials is the product of their degrees.\n\n2. **Express the Degree of \\( h(x) \\)**:\n   - The polynomial \\( h(x) \\) is defined as the sum \\( f(g(x)) + g(x) \\).\n   - The degree of a sum of two polynomials is the maximum of their degrees: thus, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\deg(h) = \\max(2d, d)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Use the Given Condition**:\n   - We know from the problem statement that \\( \\deg(h) = 6 \\).\n\n4. **Set Up Equations Based on Maximum Degree**:\n   - This gives us two scenarios to consider:\n     - **Scenario 1**: If \\( 2d \\) is the maximum, then \\( 2d = 6 \\).\n     - **Scenario 2**: If \\( d \\) is the maximum, then \\( d = 6 \\).\n\n5. **Analyze Each Scenario**:\n   - **Scenario 1**: Solve \\( 2d = 6 \\):\n     \\[\n     d = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n     \\]\n   - **Scenario 2**: Solve \\( d = 6 \\):\n     \\[\n     d = 6\n     \\]\n     - However, if \\( d = 6 \\), then \\( 2d = 12 \\), which cannot be the maximum degree since it would contradict that \\( \\deg(h) = 6 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Thus, the only valid solution for the degree of \\( g(x) \\) is from Scenario 1, where \\( d = 3 \\).\n\nIn conclusion, the degree of \\( g(x) \\) is:\n\n<ANSWER>3</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "$f(g(x))$ must have a degree of 6, because it will produce the term with the greatest exponent of the polynomial. Because $f(x)$ is a degree 2 polynomial, we can write that $f(x)=bx^2+cx+d$. The term with the greatest exponent in $f(g(x))$ comes from taking $bx^2$ or $b(g(x))^2$. Let $g(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_0$. Then, the highest degree term of $f(g(x))$ is $b(a_nx^n)^2$, which equals $ba_{n}^2x^{2n}$. Since the degree of $h$ is 6, we have $2n=6$, so $n=3$.  Therefore, the degree of $g$ is $\\boxed{3}$."
