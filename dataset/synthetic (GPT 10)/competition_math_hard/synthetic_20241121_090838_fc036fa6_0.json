  "problem": "For $1 \\le n \\le 100$, how many integers are there such that $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal?",
  "solution": "To determine how many integers \\( n \\) in the range \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 100 \\) result in the fraction \\( \\frac{n}{n+1} \\) being a repeating decimal, we need to analyze the properties of the fraction, particularly its denominator.\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary:\n\n1. **Identify the Fraction**: The fraction we are examining is \\( \\frac{n}{n+1} \\).\n\n2. **Denominator Range**: For \\( n \\) from 1 to 100, the denominator \\( n + 1 \\) ranges from 2 to 101.\n\n3. **Condition for Terminating Decimals**: A fraction \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) has a terminating decimal if the simplified denominator \\( b \\) contains only the prime factors 2 and 5. In contrast, if \\( b \\) has any prime factors other than 2 or 5, the decimal representation will be repeating.\n\n4. **Identify Terminating Cases**: We need to find all integers \\( n + 1 \\) (from 2 to 101) that can be expressed solely in terms of the prime factors 2 and 5:\n   - **Powers of 2**: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 (correspond to \\( n \\): 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63).\n   - **Powers of 5**: 5, 25 (correspond to \\( n \\): 4, 24).\n   - **Combinations of Powers of 2 and 5**: 10, 20, 50 (correspond to \\( n \\): 9, 19, 49).\n   - Collectively, the integers \\( n + 1 \\) that yield terminating decimals are: \n     \\( 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 64, 80, 100 \\).\n   - The corresponding \\( n \\) values are: \\( 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 15, 19, 24, 31, 39, 49, 63, 79, 99 \\).\n   - The total count of these terminating cases is 14.\n\n5. **Total Count of Integers**: There are 100 integers from 1 to 100.\n\n6. **Calculating Repeating Decimals**: To find the count of integers yielding repeating decimals, subtract the terminating cases from the total count:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Repeating case count} = 100 - 14 = 86.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of integers \\( n \\) such that \\( \\frac{n}{n+1} \\) is a repeating decimal is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{86}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $n+1$ and $n$ will never share any common factors except for $1$, because they are consecutive integers. Therefore, $n/(n+1)$ is already simplified, for all positive integers $n$.\n\nSince $1 \\le n \\le 100$, it follows that $2 \\le n+1 \\le 101$. Recall that a simplified fraction has a repeating decimal representation if and only if its denominator is divisible by a prime other than 2 and 5. The numbers between 2 and 101 which are divisible only by 2 and 5 comprise the set $\\{2, 4, 5, 8, \\allowbreak 10, 16, 20, 25, \\allowbreak 32, 40, 50, 64, \\allowbreak 80, 100\\}$. Therefore, there are $14$ terminating decimals and $100 - 14 = \\boxed{86}$ repeating decimals."
