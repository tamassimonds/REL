  "problem": "A relatively prime date is a date for which the number of the month and the number of the day are relatively prime. For example, June 17 is a relatively prime date because the greatest common factor of 6 and 17 is 1. How many relatively prime dates are in the month with the fewest relatively prime dates?",
  "solution": "To find the month with the fewest relatively prime dates, we need to analyze each month and the days within it, identifying how many days are relatively prime to the month number. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Understanding Relatively Prime:** \n   We will determine the gcd of the month number and each day in that month to find which days are relatively prime.\n\n2. **List of Months and Days:**\n   - January (31 days)\n   - February (28 days)\n   - March (31 days)\n   - April (30 days)\n   - May (31 days)\n   - June (30 days)\n   - July (31 days)\n   - August (31 days)\n   - September (30 days)\n   - October (31 days)\n   - November (30 days)\n   - December (31 days)\n\n3. **Counting Relatively Prime Days for Each Month:**\n   We will calculate how many days in each month are relatively prime to the month number.\n\n4. **Calculations:**\n   - **January (1):** All 31 days are relatively prime. **Total = 31**\n   - **February (2):** Only odd days (1, 3, ..., 27) are relatively prime. **Total = 14**\n   - **March (3):** Days not divisible by 3 (1, 2, 4, ..., 31) are relatively prime. **Total = 21**\n   - **April (4):** Only odd days are relatively prime. **Total = 15**\n   - **May (5):** Days not divisible by 5 are relatively prime. **Total = 24**\n   - **June (6):** Avoid multiples of 2 and 3. **Total = 10**\n   - **July (7):** Days not divisible by 7 are relatively prime. **Total = 26**\n   - **August (8):** Avoid multiples of 2. **Total = 16**\n   - **September (9):** Avoid multiples of 3. **Total = 20**\n   - **October (10):** Avoid multiples of 2 and 5. **Total = 12**\n   - **November (11):** Avoid multiples of 11. **Total = 29**\n   - **December (12):** Avoid multiples of 2, 3, and 4. **Total = 10**\n\n5. **Identifying the Month with the Fewest Relatively Prime Days:**\n   - January: 31\n   - February: 14\n   - March: 21\n   - April: 15\n   - May: 24\n   - June: 10\n   - July: 26\n   - August: 16\n   - September: 20\n   - October: 12\n   - November: 29\n   - December: 10 \n\nFrom this analysis, June and December each have the fewest relatively prime days, totaling **10**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe months with the fewest relatively prime days are June and December, each with **10** relatively prime dates.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>10 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since exactly 1 in every $n$ consecutive dates is divisible by $n$, the month with the fewest relatively prime days is the month with the greatest number of distinct small prime divisors. This reasoning gives us June ($6=2\\cdot3$) and December ($12=2^2\\cdot3$). December, however, has one more relatively prime day, namely December 31, than does June, which has only 30 days. Therefore, June has the fewest relatively prime days. To count how many relatively prime days June has, we must count the number of days that are divisible neither by 2 nor by 3. Out of its 30 days, $\\frac{30}{2}=15$ are divisible by 2 and $\\frac{30}{3}=10$ are divisible by 3. We are double counting the number of days that are divisible by 6, $\\frac{30}{6}=5$ days. Thus, June has $30-(15+10-5)=30-20=\\boxed{10}$ relatively prime days."
