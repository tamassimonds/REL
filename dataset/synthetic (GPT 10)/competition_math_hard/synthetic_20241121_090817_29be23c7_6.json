  "problem": "Compute the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome when written in both base 2 and 4.",
  "solution": "To find the smallest positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Definition of Palindromes\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as 121.\n\n### Step 2: Starting Point\nWe begin our search from the smallest integer greater than 5, which is 6.\n\n### Step 3: Conversion and Checking\nFor each integer starting from 6, we will convert it to both base 2 and base 4, then check if both representations are palindromes.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating Each Number\nWe will check each number sequentially:\n\n1. **Number 6:**\n   - Base 2: 110 (not a palindrome)\n   - Base 4: 12 (not a palindrome)\n\n2. **Number 7:**\n   - Base 2: 111 (palindrome)\n   - Base 4: 13 (not a palindrome)\n\n3. **Number 8:**\n   - Base 2: 1000 (not a palindrome)\n   - Base 4: 20 (not a palindrome)\n\n4. **Number 9:**\n   - Base 2: 1001 (palindrome)\n   - Base 4: 21 (not a palindrome)\n\n5. **Number 10:**\n   - Base 2: 1010 (not a palindrome)\n   - Base 4: 22 (palindrome)\n\n6. **Number 11:**\n   - Base 2: 1011 (not a palindrome)\n   - Base 4: 23 (not a palindrome)\n\n7. **Number 12:**\n   - Base 2: 1100 (not a palindrome)\n   - Base 4: 30 (not a palindrome)\n\n8. **Number 13:**\n   - Base 2: 1101 (not a palindrome)\n   - Base 4: 31 (not a palindrome)\n\n9. **Number 14:**\n   - Base 2: 1110 (not a palindrome)\n   - Base 4: 32 (not a palindrome)\n\n10. **Number 15:**\n    - Base 2: 1111 (palindrome)\n    - Base 4: 33 (palindrome)\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe smallest positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4 is 15.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>15</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4. Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$. We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$. Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \\boxed{15}$."
