  "problem": "Mrs. Riley recorded this information from a recent test taken by all of her students. Using the data, what was the average percent score for these $100$ students?\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n\\multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\\\\\hline\n\\textbf{$\\%$ Score}&\\textbf{Number of Students}\\\\\\hline\n100&7\\\\\\hline\n90&18\\\\\\hline\n80&35\\\\\\hline\n70&25\\\\\\hline\n60&10\\\\\\hline\n50&3\\\\\\hline\n40&2\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
  "solution": "To calculate the average percent score for 100 students based on the provided data, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Scores for Each Group**: For each percentage score, multiply the score by the number of students who received that score.\n  \n   For the given data:\n   - 100% Score: \\( 100 \\times 7 = 700 \\)\n   - 90% Score: \\( 90 \\times 18 = 1620 \\)\n   - 80% Score: \\( 80 \\times 35 = 2800 \\)\n   - 70% Score: \\( 70 \\times 25 = 1750 \\)\n   - 60% Score: \\( 60 \\times 10 = 600 \\)\n   - 50% Score: \\( 50 \\times 3 = 150 \\)\n   - 40% Score: \\( 40 \\times 2 = 80 \\)\n\n2. **Sum the Total Scores**: Next, we will add all the individual total scores together to find the overall total score: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Score} = 700 + 1620 + 2800 + 1750 + 600 + 150 + 80 = 7700\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Average Percent Score**: Finally, to obtain the average percent score, divide the overall total score by the total number of students:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Percent Score} = \\frac{7700}{100} = 77\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe average percent score for the 100 students is **77**.",
  "ground_truth": "For simplicity, divide all the percent scores by $10.$ We will account for this later by multiplying by $10.$ The average percent score is equal to the sum of all percent scores divided by the total number of students $(100).$ The sum of all percent scores is $$10\\cdot7+9\\cdot18+8\\cdot35+7\\cdot25+6\\cdot10+5\\cdot3+4\\cdot2=770.$$ Since we divided all the percent scores by $10$ in the beginning, we multiply by $10$ to get that the sum of all percent scores is $770\\cdot10=7700.$ Finally, dividing by the total number of students, we find that the average percent score is $7700/100=\\boxed{77}.$"
