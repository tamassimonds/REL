  "problem": "A ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$, where $t$ is the time after launch. What is the maximum height of the ball, in feet?",
  "solution": "To determine the maximum height of the ball, we analyze the height function given by the quadratic expression:\n\n\\[ h(t) = -16t^2 + 80t + 21. \\]\n\n### Analysis of the Quadratic Function\nThis function represents a downward-opening parabola because the coefficient of \\( t^2 \\) is negative. The vertex of this parabola, which indicates the maximum height, can be found using the vertex formula:\n\n\\[ t = -\\frac{b}{2a}, \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the coefficients of the quadratic equation in standard form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\n### Step 1: Identify the coefficients\nFrom our equation, we have:\n\n- \\( a = -16 \\)\n- \\( b = 80 \\)\n- \\( c = 21 \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the vertex time\nUsing the vertex formula, we calculate \\( t \\) (the time at which the maximum height is reached):\n\n\\[\nt = -\\frac{80}{2(-16)} = -\\frac{80}{-32} = \\frac{80}{32} = 2.5.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the maximum height\nNext, we substitute \\( t = 2.5 \\) back into the height function to find the maximum height:\n\n\\[\nh(2.5) = -16(2.5)^2 + 80(2.5) + 21.\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( (2.5)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n(2.5)^2 = 6.25.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this value into the height equation:\n\n\\[\nh(2.5) = -16(6.25) + 80(2.5) + 21 = -100 + 200 + 21 = 121.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the maximum height of the ball is:\n\n**121**.",
  "ground_truth": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+80t+21=-16(t^2-5t)+21\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-5/2)^2=6.25$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-5t)+21&=-16(t^2-5t+6.25-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16([t-2.5]^2-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16(t-2.5)^2+121\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2.5)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2.5)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+121=\\boxed{121}$ feet."
