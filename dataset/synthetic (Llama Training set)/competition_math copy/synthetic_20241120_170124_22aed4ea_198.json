    "working_out": "### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. The question is about determining how long it takes six faucets to fill a 25-gallon tub, given that three faucets can fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **Proportional Thinking:** This reminds me of problems where you deal with rates. I think I can use rates to find the answer.\n- **Unit Conversion:** Since the final answer needs to be in seconds, maybe I should convert minutes to seconds early on to avoid extra steps later.\n- **Scaling Up/Down:** I'm considering how scaling the number of faucets and the size of the tub affects the filling time.\n- **Checking Consistency:** I'm a bit uncertain if I should look at it from the perspective of total gallons per minute or gallons per faucet per minute.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not entirely sure which strategy will work best right now. Let's explore a few options and see what makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### Exploring Different Strategies\n\n**Strategy 1: Calculate the Rate per Faucet**\n\n- **Thought Process:** If three faucets fill 100 gallons in 6 minutes, maybe I can find out how much one faucet fills in a minute and then scale that to six faucets for the 25-gallon tub.\n  \n- **Calculation Attempt:**\n  - Total capacity per minute with three faucets: 100 gallons / 6 minutes = **16.67 gallons/minute**.\n  - Rate per faucet per minute: 16.67 gallons/minute \u00f7 3 faucets = **5.56 gallons/faucet/minute**.\n  \n- **Reflection:** Okay, so one faucet fills about 5.56 gallons in a minute. That seems reasonable. But am I sure this is the right approach?\n\n- **Quick Check:** Multiplying back:\n  - 5.56 gallons/faucet/minute \u00d7 3 faucets \u00d7 6 minutes = 100 gallons. This checks out.\n\n**Strategy 2: Use Proportions Based on Total Gallons**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Instead of calculating per faucet, maybe I can set up a proportion directly based on the total gallons and the number of faucets.\n\n- **Calculation Attempt:**\n  - Proportion idea: If three faucets take 6 minutes for 100 gallons, six faucets should take half the time for the same amount of water because twice the faucets should fill it faster.\n  \n- **Reflection:** This seems intuitive but might oversimplify things. I need to ensure that the proportions hold true even when the tub size changes.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Not fully convinced this works because we're dealing with different tub sizes as well.\n\n**Strategy 3: Combine Rates of Multiple Faucets**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Since all faucets work simultaneously, maybe I can think of the combined rate of six faucets filling a smaller tub and see how time changes accordingly.\n\n- **Calculation Attempt:**\n  - If three faucets take 6 minutes for 100 gallons, six faucets should be able to fill 200 gallons in the same time.\n  - But we only need 25 gallons, so I need to find out how long it takes to fill 25 gallons with six faucets.\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait a minute, this seems convoluted because I'm introducing too many variables. Perhaps I should stick to the rate per faucet.\n\n---\n\n### Settling on Strategy 1: Calculating the Rate per Faucet\n\nGiven that Strategy 2 oversimplifies and Strategy 3 adds unnecessary complexity, let's proceed with Strategy 1, where I calculate the rate per faucet. \n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Rate of Three Faucets:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rate of three faucets} = \\frac{100 \\text{ gallons}}{6 \\text{ minutes}} = 16.67 \\text{ gallons/minute}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate Rate per Faucet:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rate per faucet} = \\frac{16.67 \\text{ gallons/minute}}{3 \\text{ faucets}} = 5.56 \\text{ gallons/faucet/minute}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Determine Total Rate with Six Faucets:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total rate with six faucets} = 5.56 \\text{ gallons/faucet/minute} \\times 6 \\text{ faucets} = 33.33 \\text{ gallons/minute}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Time to Fill 25 Gallons with Six Faucets:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time required} = \\frac{25 \\text{ gallons}}{33.33 \\text{ gallons/minute}} \\approx 0.75 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert Minutes to Seconds:**\n   \\[\n   0.75 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 45 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### Checking the Work\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does 33.33 gallons per minute with six faucets make sense?\n  - With three faucets, it's 16.67 gallons/minute; doubling the number of faucets should indeed double the rate. \n  - So, 16.67 \u00d7 2 = 33.33 gallons/minute. This checks out.\n\n**Deep Reflection:**\n- Does it make sense that filling a smaller tub (25 gallons) with more faucets (six) would take less time than filling a larger tub (100 gallons) with fewer faucets (three)?\n  - Yes, because the combined rate is higher due to more faucets, and the tub size is smaller.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n- If three faucets take 6 minutes for 100 gallons, each faucet contributes to filling 33.33 gallons in total. \n- Six faucets should fill half that time for a quarter-sized tub, which aligns with our 45-second calculation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts and Conclusion\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and settling on calculating the rate per faucet, the time it takes for six faucets to fill a 25-gallon tub is **45 seconds**. \n\n**Final Checks:**\n- The calculations are consistent and align with the rates determined.\n- The proportions hold true: doubling the number of faucets halves the filling time for the same volume of water.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- By methodically breaking down the problem and verifying each step, I've arrived at the answer confidently. The key was to maintain awareness of how the number of faucets and the tub size interact in terms of filling time.",

  "ground_truth": "Since three faucets can fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, six can do it twice as fast, i.e. 3 minutes.  Additionally, the tub is a quarter the size and thus it will be filled four times as fast which gives $3/4$ minutes or $\\boxed{45}$ seconds."
