    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about finding the common ratio of a geometric sequence. I'll walk through my thought process step by step, exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were tackling this problem on my own. Let's begin by brainstorming how to approach it.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen I first see the sequence \\(16, -24, 36, -54\\), I immediately recognize it as a geometric sequence because each term multiplies by a constant factor to get the next term. My initial thoughts are:\n\n- **Idea 1:** **Divide Consecutive Terms:** I remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by the common ratio (\\(r\\)). So, I could find \\(r\\) by dividing any term by its predecessor.\n\n- **Idea 2:** **Check for Alternating Signs:** Notice that the sequence alternates signs. This suggests that the common ratio might involve a negative value, which could be a clue about the magnitude of \\(r\\).\n\n- **Idea 3:** **Use Multiple Ratios for Verification:** To ensure accuracy, I could calculate \\(r\\) using multiple pairs of terms and see if they all yield the same result.\n\n**Reflecting on these ideas:** Dividing consecutive terms seems straightforward. Checking for alternating signs is a good sanity check. Using multiple ratios will help confirm the common ratio's correctness.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Common Ratio**\n\n**Approach:** I'll start by dividing the second term by the first term to find \\(r\\).\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\text{Second term}}{\\text{First term}} = \\frac{-24}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-24}{16} = -\\frac{24}{16} = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Wait, let me make sure this makes sense. A ratio of \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) indicates that each term is multiplied by \\(-1.5\\), which aligns with the alternating signs in the sequence. This seems reasonable.\n\n**Reflection:** So far, so good. But to be sure, I'll check with another pair of terms.\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with Another Pair of Terms**\n\n**Approach:** I'll calculate the ratio using the third term and the second term.\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{36}{-24}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{36}{-24} = -\\frac{36}{24} = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Again, I get \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\). This consistency is reassuring.\n\n**Reflection:** It looks like the common ratio is consistently \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\). To be extra sure, I'll check one more pair.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Verification with Last Pair**\n\n**Approach:** I'll use the fourth term and the third term to confirm the common ratio.\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-54}{36}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-54}{36} = -\\frac{54}{36} = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Once more, the common ratio is \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\). Everything checks out.\n\n**Reflection:** Confirming with all three pairs of terms reassures me that the common ratio is indeed \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\). Multiple verifications help eliminate any doubt.\n\n### **Step 4: Consistency with Sequence Properties**\n\n**Approach:** Let's think about the properties of geometric sequences to ensure our answer makes sense.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- In a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by the common ratio.\n- The alternating signs suggest that multiplying by a negative ratio is correct.\n- The magnitude of the common ratio being greater than 1 (\\(|r| = \\frac{3}{2} > 1\\)) means each term's absolute value increases, which aligns with the sequence provided.\n\n**Reflection:** Everything aligns with the characteristics of a geometric sequence. The common ratio of \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) fits perfectly.\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Correctness**\n\n**Approach:** Before concluding, let's perform a sanity check by reconstructing the sequence using the common ratio.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Start with the first term: \\(16\\)\n- Multiply by \\(r = -\\frac{3}{2}\\): \n\n  \\[\n  16 \\times -\\frac{3}{2} = -24\n  \\]\n\n- Multiply by \\(r\\) again:\n\n  \\[\n  -24 \\times -\\frac{3}{2} = 36\n  \\]\n\n- Multiply by \\(r\\) once more:\n\n  \\[\n  36 \\times -\\frac{3}{2} = -54\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:** The sequence reconstructed using the common ratio matches the original sequence: \\(16, -24, 36, -54\\). This confirms that our calculation is correct.\n\n**Reflection:** Reconstructing the sequence verifies the accuracy of the common ratio. It all checks out.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying with multiple pairs of terms, and ensuring consistency with the properties of geometric sequences, I confidently conclude that the common ratio of the sequence is:\n\n\\[\nr = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nThroughout this process, checking multiple approaches and reflecting on the correctness of each step helped ensure the accuracy of the solution. This methodical approach is essential in tackling geometric sequence problems to avoid any miscalculations or assumptions.",
