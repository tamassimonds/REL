    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it step by step, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting my methods as needed\u2014just like I would if I were tackling this problem on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equations:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\)\n\nI recognize these as the equations of conic sections\u2014specifically, an **ellipse** and a **hyperbola**. \n\nThe problem gives us the locations of the foci for both curves:\n\n- The ellipse has foci at \\((0, \\pm 4)\\)\n- The hyperbola has foci at \\((\\pm 6, 0)\\)\n\nImmediately, I recall that the positions of the foci are related to the parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in these equations. But I'm not entirely sure how to connect that information directly to find \\(|ab|\\).\n\n#### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Standard Forms of Ellipse and Hyperbola:**\n   I know the standard forms have specific relationships between \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and the distances to the foci. Maybe I can set up equations based on the given foci.\n\n2. **Relate the Foci to the Major and Minor Axes:**\n   Understanding which axes are major and minor in both conics might help relate \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to the foci.\n\n3. **Solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) Separately:**\n   If I can find separate equations for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps multiplying them would give me \\(|ab|\\).\n\n4. **Check Symmetry and Simplify:**\n   Maybe there's a way to exploit the symmetry of the graphs to simplify the problem.\n\nHonestly, the first two strategies seem promising because they directly relate the foci to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The others might come after verifying these don't work.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Ellipse**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start with the ellipse:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nGiven its foci are at \\((0, \\pm 4)\\), it suggests that the major axis is along the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, so if the foci are at \\((0, \\pm 4)\\), does that mean the distance from the center to each focus \\(c\\) is 4? \n\nThat makes sense because the ellipse is aligned vertically.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFor ellipses, the relationship between the semi-major axis \\(b\\), semi-minor axis \\(a\\), and the distance to the foci \\(c\\) is:\n\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{b^2 - a^2}\n\\]\n\nSo, here:\n\n\\[\n4 = \\sqrt{b^2 - a^2}\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\nThis seems correct because in vertical ellipses, the foci lie along the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation for the Ellipse**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need another relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Typically, ellipses have their foci at \\(b\\) if aligned with the major axis, so:\n\n\\[\nb^2 = a^2 + c^2\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(c = 4\\), I can substitute \\(c\\) and rearrange to find \\(b^2\\) in terms of \\(a^2\\).\n\n\\[\nb^2 = a^2 + 16\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis provides a direct link between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which is helpful. I can use this to substitute into other equations later.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Understanding the Hyperbola**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, let's look at the hyperbola:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nThe foci are at \\((\\pm 6, 0)\\), indicating the hyperbola opens horizontally.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nSo, the distance to the foci \\(c\\) is 6, aligned with the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFor hyperbolas, the relationship is:\n\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(c = 6\\):\n\n\\[\n6 = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, now I have two equations:\n\n1. \\(c = \\sqrt{b^2 - a^2} = 4\\) (from the ellipse)\n2. \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 6\\) (from the hyperbola)\n\nI can set them up to solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI have:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{b^2 - a^2} = 4 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 6 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both equations to eliminate the square roots seems straightforward.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n**From Equation (1):**\n\n\\[\nb^2 - a^2 = 16 \\quad \\text{(A)}\n\\]\n\n**From Equation (2):**\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = 36 \\quad \\text{(B)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, I can add and subtract these equations to solve for \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\).\n\n**Adding Equations (A) and (B):**\n\n\\[\n(b^2 - a^2) + (a^2 + b^2) = 16 + 36\n\\]\n\\[\n2b^2 = 52 \\implies b^2 = 26\n\\]\n\n**Subtracting Equation (A) from (B):**\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + b^2) - (b^2 - a^2) = 36 - 16\n\\]\n\\[\n2a^2 = 20 \\implies a^2 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\nWait, that seems too neat. Let me double-check by substituting back into the original equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore proceeding, let's ensure \\(a^2 = 10\\) and \\(b^2 = 26\\) satisfy both original conditions.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n**For the Ellipse:**\n\n\\[\n4 = \\sqrt{b^2 - a^2} = \\sqrt{26 - 10} = \\sqrt{16} = 4 \\quad \\checkmark\n\\]\n\n**For the Hyperbola:**\n\n\\[\n6 = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{10 + 26} = \\sqrt{36} = 6 \\quad \\checkmark\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the values are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Computing \\(|ab|\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have \\(a^2 = 10\\) and \\(b^2 = 26\\), I can find \\(|ab|\\).\n\n\\[\n|ab| = |a| \\times |b|\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a^2 = 10\\) and \\(b^2 = 26\\), \n\n\\[\n|a| = \\sqrt{10}, \\quad |b| = \\sqrt{26}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n|ab| = \\sqrt{10} \\times \\sqrt{26} = \\sqrt{260}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{260} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 65} = 2\\sqrt{65}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a moment\u2014does this match what I should expect? Let me think. The problem asks for \\(|ab|\\), and given the relationships and the verification steps, this seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure correctness, I'll recap the entire process and see if any assumptions were off.\n\n1. **Ellipse Setup:**\n   - Foci at \\((0, \\pm 4)\\) \u21d2 \\(c = 4\\)\n   - Relationship: \\(b^2 = a^2 + c^2\\)\n\n2. **Hyperbola Setup:**\n   - Foci at \\((\\pm 6, 0)\\) \u21d2 \\(c = 6\\)\n   - Relationship: \\(a^2 + b^2 = 36\\)\n\n3. **Solving the System:**\n   - From both setups, \\(a^2 = 10\\), \\(b^2 = 26\\)\n\n4. **Computing \\(|ab|\\):**\n   - \\(|ab| = 2\\sqrt{65}\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything ties together neatly. The values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) satisfy both conic equations, and the computation for \\(|ab|\\) follows logically.\n\nGiven the relationships and the checks, the final answer makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n|ab| = 2\\sqrt{65}\n\\]\n\nAlright, this might seem like a lot of steps, but breaking it down helped ensure accuracy. By consistently reflecting and verifying each part of the process, I arrived at the correct solution confidently.",
