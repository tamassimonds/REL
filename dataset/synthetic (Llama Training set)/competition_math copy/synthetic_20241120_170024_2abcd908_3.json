    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem about finding the number of diagonals in a convex polygon with 20 sides. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like a human would naturally think through it.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I think, \"Okay, I've dealt with polygons before, but I don't remember the exact formula for diagonals off the top of my head.\" It feels similar to problems involving polygons and their properties, but I can't recall all the details. Maybe I need to brainstorm different methods to refresh my memory or find a new approach.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use a Formula:** I vaguely remember there's a formula to calculate the number of diagonals based on the number of sides (\\(n\\)). But I'm not sure if I remember it correctly.\n\n2. **Enumerate Diagonals Manually:** For smaller polygons, like triangles or quadrilaterals, I could try counting the diagonals by hand to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n3. **Visual Approach:** Draw the polygon and its diagonals to get a visual sense of the problem.\n\n4. **Reflect on Similar Problems:** Maybe look at how this problem relates to finding the number of edges or vertices in a geometric figure.\n\nAt this point, I think starting with a formula would be the most efficient, but I'm unsure if I remember it correctly. So, I\u2019ll proceed with that and see if it makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Use the Diagonal Formula**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nI recall that there's a formula for calculating the number of diagonals in a convex polygon:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Diagonals} = \\frac{n(n - 3)}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(n\\) is the number of sides. Let\u2019s plug in \\(n = 20\\) and see what we get.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Diagonals} = \\frac{20 \\times (20 - 3)}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{20 \\times 17}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{340}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 170\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, 170? That seems like a reasonable number for a 20-sided polygon. But let me double-check the formula to ensure it's correct. Does it account for all non-adjacent vertices correctly?\n\nNormally, the formula divides by 2 because each diagonal is counted twice (once from each end). This makes sense. So, I think the formula is correct.\n\nBut just to be sure, I\u2019ll consider another approach to validate this result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring a Manual Enumeration Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nMaybe I can calculate the number of diagonals by considering how many ways I can connect vertices that aren\u2019t adjacent. This might help confirm the formula\u2019s result.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Total Connections:** First, calculate the total number of connections between vertices.\n- **Subtract Sides:** Subtract the number of sides since those aren't diagonals.\n- **Account for Adjacent Connections:** Ensure that only non-adjacent connections are counted as diagonals.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Total Possible Connections:**\n   Each vertex can connect to \\(n - 1\\) other vertices, so for 20 vertices:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Connections} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190\n   \\]\n\n   (Divided by 2 to avoid double-counting since a connection between vertex A and B is the same as B to A.)\n\n2. **Subtract Sides:**\n   There are 20 sides, so:\n\n   \\[\n   190 - 20 = 170\n   \\]\n\n3. **Check for Over-subtraction:**\n   Wait, doing it this way seems to match the formula's result. But let me think through it\u2014each diagonal connects two non-adjacent vertices, so I need to ensure that all adjacent connections (the sides) are properly accounted for.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis manual method also gives 170, which matches the formula. This suggests that the formula is indeed correct.\n\nBut to be extra cautious, I should consider if there are any over-counts or under-counts. Specifically, ensure that each diagonal is only counted once, which the formula accounts for by dividing by 2.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Validating with a Smaller Polygon**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nTo ensure the correctness of my approach, let\u2019s test it with a smaller, more manageable polygon, like a hexagon (6 sides).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Using the Formula:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Diagonals} = \\frac{6 \\times (6 - 3)}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 3}{2} = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Manual Enumeration Approach:**\n\n   - **Total Connections:** \\(\\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15\\)\n   - **Subtract Sides:** \\(15 - 6 = 9\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth methods agree\u20149 diagonals for a hexagon. This consistency adds confidence to the correctness of the formula and my approach for the 20-sided polygon.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation for the 20-Sided Polygon**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nNow, returning to the original problem with \\(n = 20\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Diagonals} = \\frac{20 \\times (20 - 3)}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 17}{2} = \\frac{340}{2} = 170\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying with a smaller example, I\u2019m confident that the number of diagonals in a convex polygon with 20 sides is **170**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy starting with the formula for diagonals, validating it through a manual enumeration approach, and confirming its correctness with a smaller polygon, I've arrived at the solution systematically. Throughout the process, I reflected on each step, checking for consistency and correctness, which ensured a reliable and accurate result.",

  "ground_truth": "For each of the 20 vertices of the polygon, there are 17 other nonadjacent vertices that we can connect the original vertex with to form a diagonal.  However, multiplying 20 by 17 would count each diagonal twice---once for each of the diagonal's endpoints. We must divide the result by 2 to correct for this, so the answer is $(20\\cdot 17)/2=\\boxed{170}$."
