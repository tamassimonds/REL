I'll brainstorm various approaches, reflect on their validity, and check my work frequently to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, so the problem says: When a number is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. We need to find the remainder when three times that number minus 7 is divided by 7. \n\nInitially, this reminds me of working with congruences in modular arithmetic, which is something I've dealt with before. But let me brainstorm a bit more to see if there are other angles to approach this.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Use Modular Arithmetic:** Since we're dealing with remainders, maybe I can express the number in terms of congruences.\n  2. **Substitution Method:** Find the number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 7 and then manipulate it as per the problem's instructions.\n  3. **Simplify Step by Step:** Take it one step at a time, applying each operation carefully and checking the remainder after each step.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 1: Use Modular Arithmetic**\n\nLet's start with the first strategy\u2014modular arithmetic\u2014since it directly relates to the problem's requirements.\n\n- Given: \\( n \\equiv 2 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 7) \\)\n  \n  This means any number \\( n \\) can be written as:\n  \n  \\[\n  n = 7k + 2\n  \\]\n  \n  where \\( k \\) is some integer.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, this feels like a solid starting point because it sets up the problem in terms of multiples of 7, which is exactly what we need for the second part. Let's proceed with it.\n\n**Step 1: Express Three Times the Number Minus 7**\n\nNow, according to the problem, we need to find the remainder when \\( 3n - 7 \\) is divided by 7.\n\nSubstitute \\( n = 7k + 2 \\) into the expression:\n\n\\[\n3n - 7 = 3(7k + 2) - 7 = 21k + 6 - 7 = 21k - 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, so \\( 21k - 1 \\). Let me check this quickly: \\( 21k \\) is definitely a multiple of 7 since \\( 21 = 3 \\times 7 \\). So, subtracting 1 should just affect the remainder by bringing it down by 1. But let me verify to be sure.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- \\( 21k \\div 7 = 3k \\) with no remainder.\n- Subtracting 1 means we're looking at \\( 0 - 1 \\mod 7 \\), which should be \\( 6 \\mod 7 \\).\n\n**Does It Make Sense?**\n\nYeah, that checks out. When you subtract 1 from a multiple of 7, you get a remainder of 6.\n\n**Step 2: Final Answer**\n\nSo, the remainder when \\( 3n - 7 \\) is divided by 7 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\n**Exploring Strategy 2: Substitution Method**\n\nLet's think about another approach to confirm our answer. Perhaps using concrete numbers to see if the modular method holds true.\n\n- **Example Number:**\n  \n  Let's pick a number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 7. For instance, \\( n = 9 \\) (since \\( 9 \\div 7 = 1 \\) with a remainder of 2).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate \\( 3n - 7 \\)**\n\n\\[\n3(9) - 7 = 27 - 7 = 20\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the Remainder When 20 is Divided by 7**\n\n\\[\n20 \\div 7 = 2 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis aligns perfectly with our modular arithmetic approach. By using a specific example, we've confirmed that the remainder is indeed 6.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 3: Simplify Step by Step**\n\nJust to ensure everything is correct, let's break down the steps again, applying each operation carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Start with the Given Information**\n\n\\( n \\equiv 2 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 7) \\)\n\n**Step 2: Multiply by 3**\n\n\\[\n3n \\equiv 3 \\times 2 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 7) \\Rightarrow 3n \\equiv 6 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 7)\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract 7**\n\n\\[\n3n - 7 \\equiv 6 - 7 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 7) \\Rightarrow 3n - 7 \\equiv -1 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 7)\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Convert Negative Remainder to Positive**\n\n\\[\n-1 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 7) \\text{ is equivalent to } 6 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 7)\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nAgain, we arrive at a remainder of:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth strategies\u2014using modular arithmetic and testing with a concrete example\u2014yielded the same result. The remainder when three times the number minus 7 is divided by 7 is indeed **6**. Reflecting on each step and verifying with different methods helped ensure the correctness of the solution.",
