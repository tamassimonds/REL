    "working_out": "Sure, let\u2019s tackle this problem step by step, emulating a natural human thought process. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect, check for correctness, and adjust my approach as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem: \n\n*An environmental agency needs to hire a number of new employees so that:*\n- *85 of the new employees will monitor water pollution.*\n- *73 will monitor air pollution.*\n- *Exactly 27 will monitor both.*\n\n*What is the minimum number of employees that need to be hired?*\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- This reminds me of set theory, specifically dealing with unions and intersections of sets.\n- I think there's a formula related to calculating the total number of elements when dealing with overlapping sets.\n- But honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to apply it immediately. Maybe I need to visualize it better.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Use a Venn Diagram:** This could help me visually see the overlaps.\n2. **Set Theory Formula:** There's a formula for unions of two sets, which might be useful here.\n3. **Simple Addition and Subtraction:** Maybe adding the numbers and subtracting the overlaps manually could work.\n\n**Exploring Venn Diagram Approach:**\n- **Thought:** Let me sketch a quick Venn diagram in my mind. I have two circles: one for water pollution and one for air pollution. The overlapping area represents employees monitoring both.\n- **Reflection:** Wait, I need to ensure I correctly account for those who monitor both without double-counting them.\n\n**Exploring Set Theory Formula Approach:**\n- **Formula I Remember:** \\( |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B| \\)\n  - Where:\n    - \\( |A \\cup B| \\) is the total number of unique employees.\n    - \\( |A| \\) is the number monitoring water pollution.\n    - \\( |B| \\) is the number monitoring air pollution.\n    - \\( |A \\cap B| \\) is the number monitoring both.\n- **Thought:** This looks promising. I think I can use this to find the total number of employees.\n\n**Exploring Simple Addition and Subtraction:**\n- **Idea:** Maybe just add the two sets together and subtract the overlapping ones to avoid double-counting.\n- **Calculation:** But I need to make sure the overlapping part is subtracted only once.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting with Venn Diagram**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Draw two circles overlapping.\n- Assign 27 employees to the overlapping section.\n- Subtract these 27 from both the water and air pollution numbers to avoid double-counting.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Water Pollution Only: \\( 85 - 27 = 58 \\)\n- Air Pollution Only: \\( 73 - 27 = 46 \\)\n- Total Employees: \\( 58 + 46 + 27 = 131 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Wait a minute. Adding 58, 46, and 27 gives me 131. But does this make sense?\n- **Concern:** Hmm, the original numbers were 73 and 85, and I subtracted the overlap. Let me think... but I didn\u2019t account for employees who might not be monitoring either pollution type.\n\n**Realization:**\n- **Mistake:** I think I'm assuming everyone belongs to either water or air pollution groups, but what if there are employees who don\u2019t monitor at all?\n- **Correction:** I need to reconsider my approach. Maybe I\u2019m missing the total population or assuming unnecessary overlaps.\n\n**Decision:**\n- **Change Tactic:** The Venn diagram approach isn\u2019t yielding a clear answer because I haven't considered all possibilities. Let\u2019s try a different method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Set Theory Formula**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Use the formula \\( |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B| \\) to calculate the total number of unique employees.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Given:\n  - \\( |A| = 85 \\) (water pollution)\n  - \\( |B| = 73 \\) (air pollution)\n  - \\( |A \\cap B| = 27 \\) (both)\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = 85 + 73 - 27\n\\]\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = 158 - 27 = 131\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Okay, this method also gives me 131 total employees. But does this number make sense?\n- **Thought:** I\u2019m getting the same result as before. The formula seems correct, but I need to ensure that all employees are accounted for.\n\n**Realization:**\n- **Possibility:** Perhaps there are employees who don\u2019t monitor either water or air pollution, but the problem doesn\u2019t mention them.\n- **Insight:** If the problem only specifies employees monitoring at least one type, then 131 could be correct. But I\u2019m still unsure.\n\n**Concerns:**\n- **Uncertainty:** I feel that without more information, like the total population or other roles, I can\u2019t be entirely certain.\n- **Alternative Approach Needed:** Let's consider a different strategy to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Revisiting the Addition and Subtraction Approach**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Add the number of employees monitoring each pollution type and subtract those monitoring both to avoid double-counting.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Total with Overlap: \\( 85 + 73 = 158 \\)\n- Subtract Overlap: \\( 158 - 27 = 131 \\)\n\n\\[\n158 - 27 = 131\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** This method also results in 131 employees. It aligns with the set theory formula.\n- **Thought:** Maybe 131 is indeed the correct minimum number of hires needed.\n\n**Realization:**\n- **Confirmation:** By using different methods, I keep arriving at the same number. This consistency suggests that the solution is likely correct.\n- **Reflection:** Given that no additional information about employees outside the specified categories is provided, it seems reasonable to conclude that 131 is the minimum.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Checking the Answer:**\n- **Consistency:** All methods\u2014Venn diagram, set theory formula, and addition/subtraction\u2014lead to the same total of 131 employees.\n- **Assumptions:** The only assumption is that all employees fall into the specified categories (water, air, or both). If there are employees outside these categories, additional info would be needed, but the problem doesn't mention them.\n- **Conclusion:** Therefore, the minimum number of employees that need to be hired is **131**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Final Reflection:** Initially, I wasn\u2019t sure how to approach the problem, but brainstorming led me to consider set theory and Venn diagrams.\n- **Mistakes and Corrections:** Attempting the Venn diagram method made me realize I needed to consider all possibilities, which prompted me to try the set theory formula and addition/subtraction methods.\n- **Consistency and Confirmation:** By applying multiple strategies and checking for consistency, I confirmed that 131 employees is the correct minimum number needed.\n\n**Final Answer: **\n\n**131** \n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step approach, reflecting human-like thinking with brainstorming, mistakes, corrections, and checks, helps in thoroughly understanding and solving the problem!",

The remaining workers do one job each, so we need $27 + 104 = \\boxed{131}$ workers.\n\nWe also might construct the Venn Diagram below.  We start in the middle of the diagram, with the 27 workers who do both:\n\n[asy]\nlabel(\"Water\", (2,67));\nlabel(\"Air\", (80,67));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"27\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$85-27$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$73-27$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nThis gives us $27 + (73-27) + (85-27) = \\boxed{131}$ workers total."
