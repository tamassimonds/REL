    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, just like I would if I were working through it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approach, and check my work along the way to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nOkay, we have a dump truck delivering sand that forms a **conical pile**. The problem gives us the **diameter** of the cone and its **height** as a percentage of the diameter. I need to find the volume of this cone in cubic feet and express the answer in terms of \\(\\pi\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**  \n- **Volume of a Cone:** I remember the formula for the volume of a cone is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius and \\(h\\) is the height.\n- **Given Measurements:** We have the diameter, so the radius will be half of that. The height is given as 75% of the diameter, which I\u2019ll need to convert to feet.\n- **Expressing in Terms of \\(\\pi\\):** Since the question asks for the answer in terms of \\(\\pi\\), I should leave \\(\\pi\\) in the final answer, which means I won't compute \\(\\pi\\) numerically.\n\nDoes this approach seem correct? **Wait, let me double-check:** Yes, using the cone volume formula with the given dimensions aligns with the question's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Strategy**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGiven the cone's dimensions are related (height is a percentage of the diameter), I need to establish a relationship between the diameter, radius, and height. Once I have that, I can plug the values into the volume formula.\n\n**Alternative Strategies:**\n- **Use Proportions:** Since height is a percentage of the diameter, I could set up a proportion to find the height relative to the radius.\n- **Dimensional Analysis:** Ensure all units are consistent (which they are since both diameter and height are in feet).\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nI'll proceed with calculating the radius and height based on the given diameter and then apply the volume formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Radius and Height**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Diameter (\\(d\\)):**  \n   Given: \\(d = 8\\) feet\n\n2. **Radius (\\(r\\)):**  \n   \\(r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\\) feet\n\n3. **Height (\\(h\\)):**  \n   Given: Height is \\(75\\%\\) of the diameter  \n   \\(h = 0.75 \\times d = 0.75 \\times 8 = 6\\) feet\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense\u2014if the diameter is 8 feet, the radius is half of that, and the height is \\(75\\%\\) of the diameter. Everything checks out so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Applying the Volume Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have the radius and height, I can plug these values into the cone volume formula:  \n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Compute \\(r^2\\):**  \n   \\(r^2 = 4^2 = 16\\)\n\n2. **Multiply by Height (\\(h\\)):**  \n   \\(r^2 \\times h = 16 \\times 6 = 96\\)\n\n3. **Volume (\\(V\\)):**  \n   \\(V = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi \\times 96 = 32\\pi\\) cubic feet\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, let me quickly verify:\n\n- \\(r^2 = 16\\)\n- \\(16 \\times 6 = 96\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 96 = 32\\)\n\nEverything checks out. The volume is indeed \\(32\\pi\\) cubic feet.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection and Answer**\n\n**Does the Answer Make Sense?**  \n- **Units:** The volume is expressed in cubic feet, which is correct for a measurement of volume.\n- **In Terms of \\(\\pi\\):** The answer is correctly expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\), as required.\n\n**Alternative Check:**  \nI could cross-verify by calculating the volume numerically (approximating \\(\\pi\\) as 3.14) and seeing if it aligns with \\(32\\pi\\) in a conceptual sense, but since the question explicitly asks for the answer in terms of \\(\\pi\\), sticking to the exact expression is more appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\nV = 32\\pi \\text{ cubic feet}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Worked:** The initial strategy of using the cone volume formula with calculated radius and height was effective.\n- **No Alternative Needed:** Once the dimensions were clear, applying the formula directly yielded the correct answer.\n- **Mistakes Managed:** There were no significant dead ends this time, but reflecting frequently ensured each step was correct.\n- **Natural Checks:** Throughout, I checked calculations to confirm their accuracy before moving on, which helped catch any potential errors early.\n\nBy thinking through each step and regularly checking my work, I confidently arrived at the solution: \\(32\\pi\\) cubic feet.",

  "ground_truth": "The height of the cone is $\\frac{3}{4} \\times 8 = 6$. The radius of the cone is $\\frac{8}{2} = 4$. Therefore, the volume of the cone formed is $\\frac{4^2 \\times 6 \\times \\pi}{3} = \\boxed{32 \\pi}$."
