    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness, reflecting on each step, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how I would naturally solve a problem.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question\u2014finding the sum \\( (-39) + (-37) + \\cdots + (-1) \\)\u2014my initial reaction is a bit mixed.\n\n- **Equation Familiarity:** This looks like an arithmetic series, but I\u2019m not entirely sure because it involves negative numbers and perhaps skipping certain values.\n- **Range Uncertainty:** I\u2019m a little unsure about which numbers are included and how exactly they\u2019re spaced out: like, are there any numbers missing in between?\n- **Possible Strategies:** To start, I think about:\n  - Listing out the terms to see the pattern\n  - Using a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series if I can identify one\n  - Perhaps pairing terms to simplify the addition\n\nBut I'm not completely confident at this point. Let\u2019s brainstorm further.\n\n### **Brainstorming and Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Listing the Terms:**\n   - I could write out all the negative odd numbers from \\(-39\\) to \\(-1\\).\n   - **Thought:** This might give me a clear picture but could be tedious to write out all terms manually.\n\n2. **Using an Arithmetic Series Formula:**\n   - If I can confirm it's an arithmetic series, maybe I can apply the formula for the sum.\n   - **Reflection:** I need to make sure I know the first term, last term, and common difference.\n\n3. **Pairing Terms:**\n   - Another approach is to pair terms from the beginning and end, moving towards the center, to see if there's a pattern.\n   - **Check:** Does this simplify the calculation?\n\n4. **Calculating Small Portions First:**\n   - Perhaps start by summing a few terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n   - **Thought:** This could help verify if my approach is correct before proceeding further.\n\n### **Deciding on the First Step**\n\nGiven that listing all terms seems cumbersome and that I\u2019m unsure initially about applying the formula directly, I think trying to **pair terms** might be a good start. This way, I can test if it's a viable strategy and check for accuracy along the way.\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Pair Terms**\n\nLet\u2019s try pairing the first and last terms, the second and the second-to-last, and so on.\n\n- **First Pair:** \\( (-39) + (-1) \\)\n- **Second Pair:** \\( (-37) + (-3) \\)\n- **Third Pair:** \\( (-35) + (-5) \\)\n  \n**Thought Process:**\n- **Observation:** Each pair sums up to a consistent value.\n- **Question:** Wait, do all pairs actually match? Let me calculate a few to be sure.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- \\( (-39) + (-1) = -40 \\)\n- \\( (-37) + (-3) = -40 \\)\n- \\( (-35) + (-5) = -40 \\)\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Looks Consistent:** All these pairs sum to \\(-40\\).\n- **But:** I need to confirm if all terms can be paired this way without any leftover.\n\n### **Step 2: Checking Completeness of Pairs**\n\n**Thought:** Maybe not all terms can be paired because the number of terms is odd. Let's see if there's an unpaired term left.\n\n**Approach:**\n- **Count the Terms:** \n  - From \\(-39\\) to \\(-1\\), including both ends.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Listing Odd Numbers:**\n  - \\( -39, -37, -35, \\ldots, -3, -1 \\)\n  \n- **Total Count:**\n  - **Odd Numbers Between -39 and -1:**\n  - Let\u2019s see: Every second number starting from \\(-39\\) up to \\(-1\\).\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - This forms a complete sequence of negative odd numbers without any gaps.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **No Extra Terms:** Every term can be paired successfully.\n- **Conclusion:** Since all terms can be paired, the sum of each pair is consistent.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Total Sum Using Pairs**\n\n**Thought:** Since all pairs sum to \\(-40\\), and there are multiple such pairs, I can calculate the total sum by multiplying the number of pairs by \\(-40\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Number of Pairs:**\n  - Each pair consists of two terms, so the total number of pairs is half the number of terms.\n  - **Total Terms:** Let's confirm\u2014there are 20 negative odd numbers from \\(-39\\) to \\(-1\\).\n  \n- **Number of Pairs:**\n  - \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\) pairs\n  \n- **Total Sum:**\n  - \\( 10 \\times (-40) = -400 \\)\n  \n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** Does multiplying 10 by \\(-40\\) make sense given the pattern? Yes, because each pair consistently adds up to \\(-40\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Seems Correct:** The approach of pairing and consistent sum checks out.\n- **But:** Let\u2019s verify by considering an alternative method to be sure.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with an Arithmetic Series Formula**\n\n**Thought:** To confirm, let's see if applying the arithmetic series formula yields the same result.\n\n**Formula Recap:**\n- The sum \\( S_n \\) of an arithmetic series can be calculated as:\n  \\[\n  S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n  \\]\n  where:\n  - \\( n \\) = number of terms\n  - \\( a \\) = first term\n  - \\( l \\) = last term\n\n**Applying the Formula:**\n- **Given:**\n  - First term \\( a = -39 \\)\n  - Last term \\( l = -1 \\)\n  - Total number of terms \\( n = 20 \\)\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  S_n = \\frac{20}{2} \\times (-39 + (-1)) = 10 \\times (-40) = -400\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Matches the Pairing Method:** Both methods agree on the total sum being \\(-400\\).\n- **Conclusion:** The arithmetic series formula confirms the correctness of the pairing approach.\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thought:** Both methods\u2014pairing terms and using the arithmetic series formula\u2014yield the same result. This consistency suggests that the approach is correct.\n\n**Check for Reasonableness:**\n- **Negative Sum Expected:** Since all terms are negative, a negative sum makes sense.\n- **Magnitude Consistency:** The magnitude aligns with the expected range of sums for the given series.\n\n**Possible Mistakes:** \n- **Ensured No Gaps:** Confirmed that all odd negative numbers between \\(-39\\) and \\(-1\\) were included.\n- **Checked Pairing Completeness:** No unpaired terms or extra considerations needed.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, checking each step, and verifying with multiple methods, the sum of the series \\( (-39) + (-37) + \\cdots + (-1) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-400}\n\\]\n\n**Complete Reflection:**\n- **Strategy Worked:** Pairing terms simplified the calculation and ensured accuracy.\n- **Verification Validated:** The arithmetic series formula provided an additional check, confirming the result.\n- **Learning Gained:** Multiple approaches can reinforce correctness, and being open to adjusting strategies is crucial when initial thoughts need clarity.",

  "ground_truth": "The sum is an arithmetic series with common difference 2. Let $n$ be the number of terms. Then the $n$th term is $-1$, so $-39 + (n-1)(2) = -1$, or $n = 20$. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $[(-39) + (-1)]/2 \\cdot 20 = \\boxed{-400}$."
