    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start **brainstorming** different strategies and see where each one leads, reflecting along the way to ensure I'm on the right track. If something doesn't seem right, I'll adjust my approach accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y^2}{27} - \\frac{x^2}{11} = 1\n\\]\n\nthis looks like the standard form of a **hyperbola**. I remember that hyperbolas have to do with differences of squares, unlike ellipses that deal with sums. The general form of a hyperbola is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y^2}{a^2} - \\frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nCompared to the standard form, I can identify \\(a^2 = 27\\) and \\(b^2 = 11\\). So, \\(a = \\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{11}\\).\n\n**Reflection:** This makes sense because the denominators under \\(y^2\\) and \\(x^2\\) correspond to the squares of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The positive term is under \\(y^2\\), indicating that the **vertices** are along the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Identifying the vertices directly from the equation.**\n   \n   - I know that for a hyperbola of this form, the vertices are at \\((0, \\pm a)\\).\n   - Since \\(a = 3\\sqrt{3}\\), the vertices would be at \\((0, 3\\sqrt{3})\\) and \\((0, -3\\sqrt{3})\\).\n\n   **Check:** Wait, are these points correct? Let\u2019s compute \\(3\\sqrt{3}\\):\n\n   \\[\n   3\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3 \\times 1.732 = 5.196\n   \\]\n\n   So, the vertices are approximately \\((0, 5.196)\\) and \\((0, -5.196)\\).\n\n   **Thought:** That seems reasonable. I remember that the vertices of a hyperbola are always \\(a\\) units away from the center along the transverse axis, which in this case is the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\n2. **Calculating the distance between the vertices using the distance formula.**\n\n   - After identifying the vertices, I could use the distance formula to find the distance between them:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (3\\sqrt{3} - (-3\\sqrt{3}))^2} = \\sqrt{(6\\sqrt{3})^2} = 6\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n   **Check:** Let me verify the calculation step-by-step:\n\n   \\[\n   6\\sqrt{3} = 6 \\times 1.732 = 10.392\n   \\]\n\n   So, the distance is approximately \\(10.392\\).\n\n   **Reflection:** This approach seems solid. By identifying the vertices and applying the distance formula, I arrived at the same distance.\n\n3. **Considering an alternative method by analyzing the hyperbola's properties.**\n\n   - I could think about the **transverse axis**, which is the distance between the vertices. For hyperbolas, the length of the transverse axis is \\(2a\\).\n\n   \\[\n   2a = 2 \\times 3\\sqrt{3} = 6\\sqrt{3} \\approx 10.392\n   \\]\n\n   **Thought:** This aligns with the distance calculated earlier. It's good to see that both methods agree.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflecting on the Approach**\n\nAt this point, both strategies\u2014identifying the vertices directly and calculating the distance using the distance formula\u2014yielded the same result. This gives me confidence that the solution is correct.\n\nI initially considered using the distance formula after identifying the vertices, but recognizing that the length of the transverse axis is directly related to \\(2a\\) made the calculation straightforward. This alternative method provided a quick check to ensure the accuracy of the distance calculated.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nLet's summarize the final steps to ensure clarity:\n\n1. **Identified the vertices:**\n\n   \\[\n   (0, \\pm 3\\sqrt{3}) \\approx (0, \\pm 5.196)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculated the distance between the vertices:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (3\\sqrt{3} - (-3\\sqrt{3}))^2} = \\sqrt{(6\\sqrt{3})^2} = 6\\sqrt{3} \\approx 10.392\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Consistency:** Both methods\u2014using the distance formula and recognizing that the transverse axis length is \\(2a\\)\u2014produced the same distance.\n- **Verification:** By calculating \\(a = 3\\sqrt{3}\\) and doubling it, I confirmed the distance aligns with the properties of hyperbolas.\n- **Confidence:** Given that multiple approaches agree, I'm confident the distance between the vertices is \\(6\\sqrt{3}\\) or approximately \\(10.392\\).\n\nThis reflects a **human-like** thought process: starting with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking calculations, and adjusting the approach as needed to ensure the solution is correct.",
