I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to check if my approach is correct, and be ready to change direction if something doesn't seem right.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question:\n\n**Four consecutive positive prime numbers have a sum that is divisible by three. What is the smallest possible value of this sum?**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This sounds like a problem involving both prime numbers and divisibility rules, particularly regarding the number 3. My brain immediately recalls that prime numbers (other than 3) are usually not divisible by 3, which might play a role here.\n\n- **Similar Previous Problems:** It reminds me of problems where you deal with the sums of sequences, especially involving primes. I\u2019ve worked on finding consecutive prime sums before, but integrating divisibility adds a new layer.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I\u2019m not entirely sure how to start. Should I list out primes? Maybe think about their properties regarding divisibility by 3? Perhaps exploring both could work.\n\nAt this point, it seems beneficial to **brainstorm a few different strategies** to see which could lead me to the solution.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List Consecutive Primes and Check Their Sums:**\n   - I could start by listing sets of four consecutive primes and checking if their sum is divisible by 3.\n\n2. **Use Modular Arithmetic:**\n   - Since divisibility by 3 is key, maybe applying modular arithmetic could simplify the process.\n\n3. **Exploit the Properties of Primes and Divisibility:**\n   - Leverage the fact that primes (except 3) are not divisible by 3, and see how that affects their sums.\n\n4. **Combination of Listing and Modular Check:**\n   - Start by listing to get a feel and then apply modular checks to confirm.\n\nI think starting with **listing consecutive primes** might give me a concrete starting point. If that feels too cumbersome, I can switch to **modular arithmetic** for a more systematic approach.\n\n### **Step 1: Listing Consecutive Primes**\n\nLet me begin by listing the first few sets of four consecutive primes:\n\n- **First Set:** 2, 3, 5, 7  \n  - Sum: 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17  \n  - Check: 17 \u00f7 3 = 5 with a remainder of 2 \u2192 **Not divisible by 3**\n\n- **Second Set:** 3, 5, 7, 11  \n  - Sum: 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 26  \n  - Check: 26 \u00f7 3 = 8 with a remainder of 2 \u2192 **Not divisible by 3**\n\n- **Third Set:** 5, 7, 11, 13  \n  - Sum: 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 36  \n  - Check: 36 \u00f7 3 = 12 with no remainder \u2192 **Divisible by 3**\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a moment \u2013 the third set sums to 36, which is divisible by 3. This looks promising. But to be thorough, I should verify if there are smaller sets that also meet the criteria.\n\n**Quick Check:** The first two sets didn\u2019t work, but the third one does. Perhaps there\u2019s a pattern, but before jumping to conclusions, I should confirm if 36 is indeed the smallest possible sum.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Further**\n\nTo ensure that 36 is the smallest possible sum, let me consider whether there are any sets of four consecutive primes starting with primes greater than 3 that also sum to a multiple of 3.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:** Since all primes greater than 3 are congruent to either 1 or 2 modulo 3, maybe there's a pattern here that can help.\n\n### **Step 3: Introducing Modular Arithmetic**\n\nLet\u2019s see how modular arithmetic applies:\n\n- **Primes Greater than 3:** These primes are either 1 or 2 modulo 3.\n- **Consecutive Primes:** If you take four consecutive primes, their sum's remainder when divided by 3 can be analyzed.\n\n**Observation:** If all primes in a set are either 1 or 2 modulo 3, their sum might be divisible by 3. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis:**\n\n- **Set:** 5, 7, 11, 13  \n  - Remainders: 5 \u2261 2, 7 \u2261 1, 11 \u2261 2, 13 \u2261 1 (mod 3)  \n  - Sum of Remainders: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6 \u2261 0 (mod 3) \u2192 **Divisible by 3**\n\nThis aligns with our earlier finding that the sum is 36, which is divisible by 3.\n\n**Reflection:** This suggests that the sum of four consecutive primes can be divisible by 3 if they are arranged such that their remainders add up to a multiple of 3.\n\n### **Step 4: Validating the Approach**\n\nBefore concluding, let\u2019s check if this approach is consistent:\n\n- **Does the Sum Always Work?**  \n  - For the set 5, 7, 11, 13: Sum = 36, which is divisible by 3.\n  \n- **Are Smaller Sums Possible?**  \n  - The second set, 3, 5, 7, 11, sums to 26, which is not divisible by 3.\n  - The first set, 2, 3, 5, 7, sums to 17, also not divisible by 3.\n\n**Check:** So far, it seems that the smallest sum meeting the criteria is 36, as the only other sets I\u2019ve checked either fall short or exceed it.\n\n**Random Insight:** Wait, could there be a smaller set that I missed? Perhaps one starting with a prime greater than 5?\n\n### **Step 5: Considering Primes Greater than 5**\n\nLet me list a few sets starting with primes greater than 5:\n\n- **Set:** 7, 11, 13, 17  \n  - Sum: 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 = 48  \n  - Check: 48 \u00f7 3 = 16 with no remainder \u2192 **Divisible by 3**\n\n**Reflection:** The sum 48 is larger than 36. This suggests that starting with larger primes doesn\u2019t yield a smaller sum.\n\n**Quick Check:** So, the smallest sum I\u2019ve found that is divisible by 3 is 36. No smaller sets seem to satisfy the condition.\n\n### **Step 6: Final Verification**\n\nLet\u2019s double-check to ensure no smaller sum is possible.\n\n- **Re-examining Smaller Primes:**  \n  - The set 2, 3, 5, 7 sums to 17 (not divisible by 3).\n  \n- **Considering All Primes Up to 7:**  \n  - Beyond 3, only primes greater than 3 can be considered (since including 3 makes the sum larger).\n\n**Final Reflection:** After exploring different strategies and checking multiple sets, it appears that the smallest possible value of the sum of four consecutive primes that is divisible by 3 is **36**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming, listing consecutive primes, and applying modular arithmetic, I\u2019ve determined that the smallest sum of four consecutive primes divisible by 3 is **36**. \n\nInitially, I explored listing sets, which led me to find a valid sum but needed confirmation through modular checks. By considering the properties of primes concerning divisibility by 3, I validated that 36 is indeed the smallest such sum. No smaller consecutive prime sets yield a sum divisible by 3, confirming the solution's correctness.",
