    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I notice a few key details:\n\n1. **Square Piece of Paper:** So, the original shape is a square with sides of 6 cm. Squares have all sides equal and all angles 90 degrees, which is important.\n\n2. **Corner \\( C \\) Folded Over to \\( E \\):** Folding corner \\( C \\) to point \\( E \\), the midpoint of \\( \\overline{AD} \\), creates some crease. Point \\( F \\) lies on \\( CD \\), and I need to find the length \\( \\overline{FD} \\).\n\n3. **Crease \\( \\overline{GF} \\):** This seems to be a perpendicular bisector related to the fold.\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of geometry problems involving reflections and properties of perpendicular bisectors. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to proceed. It feels a bit like those folding paper origami problems, which can get tricky.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:** Assign coordinates to each vertex and use equations to find the necessary points.\n\n2. **Perpendicular Bisector Method:** Since \\( G \\) is on \\( FG \\) and \\( GF \\) is the crease, maybe \\( GF \\) is the perpendicular bisector of \\( \\overline{CE} \\).\n\n3. **Reflection Concept:** In folding, the reflecting line could help determine the position of \\( F \\).\n\n4. **Similar Triangles:** Maybe triangles formed by the fold and by \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) are similar or congruent.\n\n5. **Pythagorean Theorem:** Could be useful if I need to find distances between points.\n\nI think starting with the **Coordinate Geometry Approach** might give me a concrete way to visualize and calculate the points involved. If that gets too messy, I can switch to using properties of perpendicular bisectors or similar triangles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Assigning Coordinates**\n\nLet\u2019s assign coordinates to each corner of the square:\n\n- \\( A(0, 0) \\)\n- \\( B(0, 6) \\)\n- \\( C(6, 6) \\)\n- \\( D(6, 0) \\)\n\nSince \\( E \\) is the midpoint of \\( \\overline{AD} \\), its coordinates are:\n\n\\[\nE\\left(\\frac{0 + 6}{2}, \\frac{0 + 0}{2}\\right) = E(3, 0)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Does this seem correct? Yes, because the midpoint formula adds the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately and divides by 2.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Crease \\( \\overline{GF} \\)**\n\nI recall that the crease \\( \\overline{GF} \\) is often the perpendicular bisector of the segment being folded. Here, it's the perpendicular bisector of \\( \\overline{CE} \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Find Midpoint \\( M \\) of \\( \\overline{CE} \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   M\\left(\\frac{6 + 3}{2}, \\frac{6 + 0}{2}\\right) = M\\left(\\frac{9}{2}, 3\\right) = M\\left(4.5, 3\\right)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Slope of \\( \\overline{CE} \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Slope} = \\frac{0 - 6}{3 - 6} = \\frac{-6}{-3} = 2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Slope of Perpendicular Bisector \\( \\overline{GF} \\):**\n\n   The perpendicular bisector has a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the slope of \\( \\overline{CE} \\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Slope of } GF = -\\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, does that make sense? A slope of \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) seems reasonable for a diagonal in a square. Let\u2019s proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Equation of the Crease \\( \\overline{GF} \\)**\n\nNow, I'll write the equation of the line \\( GF \\) using point-slope form:\n\n\\[\ny - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the midpoint \\( M(4.5, 3) \\) and the slope \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\ny - 3 = -\\frac{1}{2}(x - 4.5)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\ny - 3 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{4.5}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\ny - 3 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 2.25\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 5.25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Does this line intersect at a reasonable point? I\u2019ll check if it crosses \\( CD \\). If not, I might need to reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding Point \\( F \\) on \\( CD \\)**\n\nThe line \\( CD \\) has a constant y-coordinate of 6 (since \\( C(6,6) \\) and \\( D(6,0) \\)). So, we can set \\( y = 6 \\) in the equation of \\( GF \\):\n\n\\[\n6 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 5.25\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\n6 - 5.25 = -\\frac{1}{2}x\n\\]\n\\[\n0.75 = -\\frac{1}{2}x\n\\]\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{0.75}{-0.5} = 1.5\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( F(1.5, 6) \\).\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a second\u2026 The y-coordinate for \\( F \\) is 6, but \\( CD \\)\u2019s y-coordinate is 6. Shouldn\u2019t \\( F \\) be somewhere else? Let me double-check.\n\n**Check:** Oh, I see! Since \\( F \\) lies on \\( CD \\) and \\( CD \\) has a y-coordinate of 6 only at \\( x = 6 \\), but my calculation gives \\( x = 1.5 \\). This doesn't align with the initial problem setup.\n\n**Realization:** It seems I might have made an error in determining the correct coordinates for point \\( F \\). Perhaps my approach needs adjusting.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-evaluating Strategy:**\n\nI think the initial approach might be flawed because the point \\( F \\) doesn't lie on \\( CD \\) as expected. Maybe instead of directly finding \\( F \\), I should consider the properties of the crease and how it interacts with the square's sides.\n\nPerhaps **Method 2: Perpendicular Bisector Method** is better. If \\( GF \\) is the perpendicular bisector of \\( \\overline{CE} \\), then \\( F \\) should be where this bisector intersects \\( CD \\).\n\nLet\u2019s explore this method.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Using the Perpendicular Bisector**\n\n1. **Midpoint \\( M \\) of \\( \\overline{CE} \\):** As calculated earlier, \\( M(4.5, 3) \\).\n\n2. **Slope of \\( \\overline{CE} \\):** Previously calculated as 2.\n\n3. **Slope of Perpendicular Bisector \\( GF \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Slope} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Equation of \\( GF \\):**\n\n   Using point-slope form with point \\( M(4.5, 3) \\):\n\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = -\\frac{1}{2}(x - 4.5)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 2.25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 5.25\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding Intersection with \\( CD \\):**\n\n   Since \\( C(6,6) \\) and \\( D(6,0) \\), the line \\( CD \\) is vertical at \\( x = 6 \\).\n\n   **Plugging \\( x = 6 \\) into \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 5.25 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   y = -\\frac{1}{2}(6) + 5.25 = -3 + 5.25 = 2.25\n   \\]\n\n   So, \\( F(6, 2.25) \\).\n\n**Reflection:** This makes more sense. Point \\( F(6, 2.25) \\) lies on \\( CD \\), which aligns with the problem\u2019s requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating \\( \\overline{FD} \\)**\n\nNow, I need to find the length of \\( \\overline{FD} \\):\n\n1. **Coordinates of \\( F \\) and \\( D \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   F(6, 2.25), \\quad D(6, 0)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Length \\( \\overline{FD} \\):**\n\n   Since both points have the same x-coordinate (6), the length is the difference in their y-coordinates:\n\n   \\[\n   \\overline{FD} = |2.25 - 0| = 2.25 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Does this make sense? Yes, because I'm measuring the vertical distance between \\( F \\) and \\( D \\) on line \\( CD \\), and the calculation aligns with the coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Expressing as a Common Fraction**\n\nThe length \\( \\overline{FD} = 2.25 \\) cm can be expressed as a common fraction:\n\n\\[\n2.25 = \\frac{9}{4} \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Is this the expected format? Yes, expressing the length as a common fraction is required, and \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) is the correct fractional representation of 2.25.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\n- **Does the length make sense?** Yes, 2.25 cm is a reasonable distance within the 6 cm square.\n\n- **Are the coordinates correct?** Yes, \\( F(6, 2.25) \\) lies on \\( CD \\), and the calculation aligns with the properties of the perpendicular bisector.\n\n- **Is the answer in the required format?** Yes, \\( \\frac{9}{4} \\) is a common fraction.\n\n**Conclusion:** After re-evaluating my initial approach and correcting the coordinates, the length \\( \\overline{FD} \\) is \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) cm.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n1. **Assigned Coordinates:** Set up the square and determined the midpoint \\( E \\).\n\n2. **Determined the Crease \\( GF \\):** Found the equation of the perpendicular bisector of \\( \\overline{CE} \\).\n\n3. **Found Point \\( F \\):** Calculated the intersection of \\( GF \\) with \\( CD \\).\n\n4. **Calculated \\( \\overline{FD} \\):** Measured the vertical distance between \\( F \\) and \\( D \\).\n\n5. **Expressed as Common Fraction:** Converted 2.25 cm to \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) cm.\n\nThroughout the process, I brainstormed different strategies, checked my work frequently, and adjusted my approach when something didn't seem right. This reflective and iterative method ensured that the final answer was accurate and in the required format.",
