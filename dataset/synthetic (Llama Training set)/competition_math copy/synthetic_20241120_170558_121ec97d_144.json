Here\u2019s how I\u2019d naturally approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the question, **\"The difference between two perfect squares is 133. What is the smallest possible sum of the two perfect squares?\"**, several things come to mind:\n\n1. **Perfect Squares**: I remember that perfect squares are numbers like \\(1^2\\), \\(2^2\\), \\(3^2\\), etc. So, the numbers involved are whole numbers squared.\n   \n2. **Difference of Squares**: This reminds me of the algebraic identity:\n   \\[\n   a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\n   \\]\n   Perhaps I could use this to relate the difference of the squares to their sum and difference.\n\n3. **Smallest Sum**: The goal is to minimize the sum of the two perfect squares. I\u2019m not sure yet how to find the smallest sum, but minimizing the squares individually might help.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Option 1**: Use the difference of squares identity to set up an equation. Maybe solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n  \n- **Option 2**: List out perfect squares and see which pairs have a difference of 133.\n  \n- **Option 3**: Consider properties of perfect squares and see if there's a pattern or shortcut.\n\nI think starting with the **difference of squares identity** might be the most direct approach. If that doesn\u2019t work, I can try listing out the squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Difference of Squares Identity**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s use the identity:\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = 133 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (a - b)(a + b) = 133\n\\]\nThis tells me that the difference between the two squares can be expressed as the product of two factors: \\( (a - b) \\) and \\( (a + b) \\).\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n- I can factor 133 into pairs of integers to find possible values for \\( a - b \\) and \\( a + b \\).\n  \n- Once I have those, I can solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nFirst, let's factor 133:\n\\[\n133 = 1 \\times 133 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 7 \\times 19\n\\]\nSo, the possible pairs \\((a - b, a + b)\\) are:\n- \\( (1, 133) \\)\n- \\( (7, 19) \\)\n- Negative pairs like \\( (-1, -133) \\) and \\( (-7, -19) \\) too, but since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive, we\u2019ll stick with positive.\n\n**Checking if This Makes Sense:**\n\nDoes it align with the problem? Yes, because each pair corresponds to a potential solution for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nLet\u2019s solve these pairs to find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) Using the Pairs**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFor each pair, I\u2019ll add and subtract the equations to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n**First Pair: \\( (1, 133) \\)**\n\n\\[\na - b = 1 \\\\\na + b = 133\n\\]\n\nAdding these equations:\n\\[\n2a = 134 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 67\n\\]\n\nSubtracting the first from the second:\n\\[\n2b = 132 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 66\n\\]\n\n**Second Pair: \\( (7, 19) \\)**\n\n\\[\na - b = 7 \\\\\na + b = 19\n\\]\n\nAdding these equations:\n\\[\n2a = 26 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 13\n\\]\n\nSubtracting the first from the second:\n\\[\n2b = 12 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 6\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Solutions:**\n\n- **For \\( a = 67 \\), b = 66\\):**\n  \\[\n  67^2 - 66^2 = 4489 - 4356 = 133 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n  \\]\n\n- **For \\( a = 13 \\), b = 6\\):**\n  \\[\n  13^2 - 6^2 = 169 - 36 = 133 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth pairs satisfy the original condition. Now, I need to find which pair gives the smallest sum.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Sums of the Perfect Squares**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI have two sets of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) that work. I\u2019ll calculate the sum of \\( a^2 + b^2 \\) for each to see which is smaller.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n**First Pair: \\( a = 67, b = 66 \\)**\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = 67^2 + 66^2 = 4489 + 4356 = 8845\n\\]\n\n**Second Pair: \\( a = 13, b = 6 \\)**\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = 13^2 + 6^2 = 169 + 36 = 205\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Sums:**\n\n- Sum for \\( a = 67, b = 66 \\): **8845**\n- Sum for \\( a = 13, b = 6 \\): **205**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute, \\( 8845 \\) seems much larger than \\( 205 \\). Logically, the smaller numbers should yield a smaller sum, so **\\( a = 13 \\) and \\( b = 6 \\)** must be the correct pair for the minimum sum.\n\n**Potential Mistake Check:**\n\nDouble-checking:\n\\[\n13^2 + 6^2 = 169 + 36 = 205 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\\[\n67^2 + 66^2 = 4489 + 4356 = 8845 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\nSo, no mistakes here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Smallest Sum**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure that \\( 205 \\) is indeed the smallest sum, I can consider whether there are other pairs of \\( (a, b) \\) that satisfy the difference of squares condition and yield a smaller sum.\n\n**Exploring Additional Strategies:**\n\n- **Factoring 133 Differently:** Maybe there are other factors of 133 that I missed. But looking closely, \\( 1 \\times 133 \\) and \\( 7 \\times 19 \\) are the only positive pairs.\n  \n- **Alternative Methods:** Perhaps using properties of perfect squares or modular arithmetic could provide insights, but I think the difference of squares method is straightforward here.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- No other positive integer pairs multiply to 133.\n- The pairs I calculated give valid perfect squares.\n- The sums computed are accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe pair \\( (13, 6) \\) gives the smallest sum of perfect squares that satisfy the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe smallest possible sum of the two perfect squares whose difference is 133 is **205**.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Difference of Squares Identity:** This was instrumental in setting up the problem correctly.\n   \n2. **Factoring the Difference:** Breaking down 133 into factors allowed solving for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   \n3. **Checking and Reflecting:** Regularly checking each step ensured accuracy and helped catch any potential mistakes early.\n   \n4. **Exploring Multiple Strategies:** Starting with one approach and being open to switching methods is crucial, especially when faced with uncertainties.\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically, reflecting often, and verifying each step, I arrived confidently at the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We are given that $x^2 - y^2 = 133$, which is the same as $(x+y)(x-y) = 133$. $133$ has two pairs of factors: 1 and 133, and 7 and 19. So, either $x+y = 133$ and $x-y = 1$, or $x+y = 19$ and $x-y = 7$. It is clear that $x$ and $y$ will be much larger in the first case, because they must sum to 133, so, because we are trying to minimize $x^2 + y^2$, we can simply consider the second case. Through simple algebra, we find that $x = 13$ and $y = 6$. Thus, $x^2 + y^2$ is minimized as $169 + 36 = \\boxed{205}$."
