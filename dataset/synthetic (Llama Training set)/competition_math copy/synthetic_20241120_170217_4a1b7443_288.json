    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and checking my work continuously to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe operation defined is \\((a \\star b) = \\frac{a + b}{a - b}\\), where \\(a \\neq b\\). The task is to compute \\(((1 \\star 2) \\star 3)\\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a nested operation, similar to how you might handle parentheses in arithmetic. I need to perform the operation \\(\\star\\) step by step, just like evaluating an expression with multiple operations.\n  \n- **Recall:** The expression involves real numbers, so I should be careful with division by zero. Thankfully, \\(a \\neq b\\) is given, which prevents that issue.\n\n- **Similar Problems:** It reminds me of evaluating expressions with custom operations or functions, like function composition. Perhaps breaking it down into smaller parts would help.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluating the Inner Operation \\((1 \\star 2)\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's tackle the innermost operation first: \\(1 \\star 2\\).\n\n- **Applying the Definition:**\n  \\[\n  1 \\star 2 = \\frac{1 + 2}{1 - 2} = \\frac{3}{-1} = -3\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, that was straightforward. The calculation seems correct. \\(\\frac{3}{-1}\\) simplifies to \\(-3\\). I\u2019ll proceed with this value.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Does it make sense?** Yes, adding 1 and 2 gives 3, and subtracting 2 from 1 gives -1. Dividing these is simple.\n  \n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating the Outer Operation \\((-3 \\star 3)\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, we need to evaluate \\((-3 \\star 3)\\). I'll use the result from Step 1 as the first operand.\n\n- **Applying the Definition:**\n  \\[\n  -3 \\star 3 = \\frac{-3 + 3}{-3 - 3} = \\frac{0}{-6} = 0\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis was straightforward too. Adding \\(-3\\) and \\(3\\) gives \\(0\\), and subtracting \\(3\\) from \\(-3\\) gives \\(-6\\). Dividing these, \\( \\frac{0}{-6} \\), is \\(0\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Does it make sense?** Yes, zero divided by any non-zero number is zero. The operation seems to handle zero correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s take a moment to ensure that each step aligns with the operation\u2019s definition and that no mistakes were made.\n\n- **Step 1 Verification:** Adding 1 and 2 to get 3, and subtracting 2 from 1 to get -1. Division checks out as \\(-3\\).\n\n- **Step 2 Verification:** Adding \\(-3\\) and 3 results in 0, and subtracting 3 from \\(-3\\) gives \\(-6\\). Division to 0 is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything seems consistent. The checks confirm that both steps align with the operation's rules.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Reassessing the Nested Operation**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\nMaybe there's a more abstract way to handle nested operations. Could I define a general expression or look for patterns?\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Defining a General Form:** Perhaps, if \\((a \\star b) = \\frac{a + b}{a - b}\\), then \\(((a \\star b) \\star c)\\) can be expressed in terms of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n  \n- **Attempting a General Approach:**\n  \\[\n  ((a \\star b) \\star c) = \\left(\\frac{a + b}{a - b} \\star c\\right) = \\frac{\\frac{a + b}{a - b} + c}{\\frac{a + b}{a - b} - c}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Simplifying:** This looks complex. Let me try simplifying it step by step.\n  \n  Substitute \\(x = a \\star b = \\frac{a + b}{a - b}\\), then:\n  \\[\n  x \\star c = \\frac{x + c}{x - c} = \\frac{\\frac{a + b}{a - b} + c}{\\frac{a + b}{a - b} - c}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying the Numerator:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{a + b}{a - b} + c = \\frac{a + b + c(a - b)}{a - b}\n  \\]\n  \n  So, the numerator becomes:\n  \\[\n  a + b + c(a - b) = a + b + ac - bc\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying the Denominator:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{a + b}{a - b} - c = \\frac{a + b - c(a - b)}{a - b}\n  \\]\n  \n  So, the denominator becomes:\n  \\[\n  a + b - ac + bc\n  \\]\n  \n- **Combining:**\n  \\[\n  ((a \\star b) \\star c) = \\frac{a + b + ac - bc}{a + b - ac + bc}\n  \\]\n  \n**Applying to Our Problem:**\nGiven \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 2\\), and \\(c = 3\\):\n\\[\n((1 \\star 2) \\star 3) = \\frac{1 + 2 + 1 \\times 3 - 2 \\times 3}{1 + 2 - 1 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 3} = \\frac{3 + 3 - 6}{3 - 3 + 6} = \\frac{0}{6} = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis alternative approach also yields \\(0\\), which matches our initial step-by-step method. It's good to have verified the result using another strategy.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Consistency:** Both methods lead to the same answer, ensuring the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Verification:** Both approaches confirm that \\(((1 \\star 2) \\star 3) = 0\\).\n\n- **Confidence:** The nested operation was handled correctly, and an alternative method provided consistency.\n\n- **Learning:** Exploring different strategies is valuable. Starting with a straightforward approach and then checking with a general method ensures accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe value of \\(((1 \\star 2) \\star 3)\\) is \\( \\boxed{0} \\).\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration, complete with brainstorming and reflections, aligns with what you're looking for.
