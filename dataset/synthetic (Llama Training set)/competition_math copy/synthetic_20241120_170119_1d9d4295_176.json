    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking through it just like how I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to ensure correctness, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, I see a triangle \\(ABC\\) with two sides equal (\\(AC = BC = 7\\)) and the third side \\(AB = 2\\). So, this is an **isosceles triangle**. There's also point \\(D\\) on line \\(AB\\) with \\(B\\) between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\), and \\(CD = 8\\). We need to find \\(BD\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Isosceles Triangle Properties:** Maybe I can use properties of isosceles triangles since \\(AC = BC\\).\n- **Law of Cosines:** This could help relate the sides and angles, especially with \\(CD\\) being external.\n- **Coordinate Geometry:** Placing the points on a coordinate plane might simplify distance calculations.\n- **Similar Triangles:** Perhaps triangles are similar if \\(D\\) creates a particular configuration.\n\nBut first, let's explore these options and see which one makes the most sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Law of Cosines:**\n   - This might help relate the sides and find angles or additional lengths.\n\n2. **Apply Coordinate Geometry:**\n   - Assign coordinates to each point and calculate distances directly.\n\n3. **Consider Similar Triangles:**\n   - Maybe \\( \\triangle BDC \\) is similar to another triangle, which could help.\n\n**Starting with Strategy 1: Law of Cosines**\n\nI think the Law of Cosines could be a good starting point since it directly relates sides and angles. Let's try that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Law of Cosines in \\( \\triangle ABC \\)**\n\nSince \\(AC = BC\\), the triangle is isosceles, which might simplify things. Let's denote the angles as:\n\n- \\( \\angle A = \\alpha \\)\n- \\( \\angle B = \\beta \\)\n- \\( \\angle C = \\gamma \\)\n\n**Law of Cosines Formula:**\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(\\theta)\n\\]\n\nIn \\( \\triangle ABC \\):\n\n- \\( a = BC = 7 \\)\n- \\( b = AC = 7 \\)\n- \\( c = AB = 2 \\)\n- \\( \\angle C = \\gamma \\)\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\[\n2^2 = 7^2 + 7^2 - 2 \\times 7 \\times 7 \\cos(\\gamma)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4 = 49 + 49 - 98 \\cos(\\gamma)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4 = 98 - 98 \\cos(\\gamma)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n98 \\cos(\\gamma) = 94\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\gamma) = \\frac{94}{98} = \\frac{47}{49}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, does this make sense? The cosine value should be between -1 and 1. Let me double-check the calculations:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{94}{98} = \\frac{47}{49} \\approx 0.9592\n\\]\n\nOkay, this cosine value is plausible. So, angle \\(C\\) is acute.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThat seems reasonable. Now I have the cosine of angle \\(C\\). But I'm not sure if this directly helps with finding \\(BD\\). Maybe I need to explore further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting Coordinate Geometry**\n\nSince the Law of Cosines didn't immediately lead me to \\(BD\\), let's try placing the triangle on a coordinate plane.\n\n**Assigning Coordinates:**\n\n- Place \\(A\\) at the origin: \\(A(0, 0)\\)\n- Since \\(AB = 2\\), place \\(B\\) at \\(B(2, 0)\\)\n- \\(C\\) is at equal distance from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), so \\(AC = BC = 7\\)\n\nBut wait, assigning \\(B(2, 0)\\) means \\(AB = 2\\), which is correct. Let's find \\(C\\).\n\n**Calculating Coordinates of \\(C\\):**\n\nSince \\(AC = 7\\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 = 49 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(BC = 7\\), so:\n\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 49 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\n**Subtracting Equation (1) from Equation (2):**\n\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 49 - 49\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-4x + 4 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4x = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 1\n\\]\n\n**Plugging \\(x = 1\\) into Equation (1):**\n\n\\[\n1^2 + y^2 = 49\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1 + y^2 = 49\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny^2 = 48\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\pm \\sqrt{48} = \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Choosing the Positive \\(y\\):**\n\nLet's take \\(C(1, 4\\sqrt{3})\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nHmm, now I have the coordinates for all points. Maybe I can use the distance formula to find \\(D\\) and then \\(BD\\).\n\nBut wait, I still need to relate \\(D\\) to \\(C\\) since \\(CD = 8\\). Let me think this through.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Placing Point \\(D\\) and Finding \\(BD\\)**\n\nGiven \\(CD = 8\\), let's find the coordinates of \\(D\\).\n\n**Distance Formula:**\n\n\\[\nCD = \\sqrt{(x_D - x_C)^2 + (y_D - y_C)^2} = 8\n\\]\n\nWe know \\(C = (1, 4\\sqrt{3})\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x_D - 1)^2 + (y_D - 4\\sqrt{3})^2} = 8\n\\]\n\n**Expressing \\(D\\) on \\(AB\\):**\n\nSince \\(D\\) lies on \\(AB\\), and \\(B\\) is at \\( (2, 0) \\), the line \\(AB\\) has a slope of 0 (horizontal line). Therefore, \\(D\\) has the same \\(y\\)-coordinate as \\(B\\), which is 0.\n\nThus, \\(D = (d, 0)\\) where \\(d > 2\\) because \\(B\\) is between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\).\n\n**Plugging into the Distance Formula:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(d - 1)^2 + (0 - 4\\sqrt{3})^2} = 8\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(d - 1)^2 + (4\\sqrt{3})^2 = 64\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(d - 1)^2 + 48 = 64\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(d - 1)^2 = 16\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd - 1 = \\pm 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = 5 \\, \\text{or} \\, -3\n\\]\n\n**Choosing \\(d = 5\\):**\n\nSince \\(d\\) must be greater than 2 (as \\(D\\) is beyond \\(B\\) on line \\(AB\\)), we take \\(d = 5\\).\n\nSo, \\(D = (5, 0)\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlright, now I have the coordinates for all points:\n\n- \\(A(0, 0)\\)\n- \\(B(2, 0)\\)\n- \\(C(1, 4\\sqrt{3})\\)\n- \\(D(5, 0)\\)\n\nNow, I can find \\(BD\\) using the distance formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating \\(BD\\)**\n\nNow that we have the coordinates of \\(B\\) and \\(D\\), let's find \\(BD\\):\n\n\\[\nBD = \\sqrt{(x_D - x_B)^2 + (y_D - y_B)^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nBD = \\sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me double-check this. The distance calculation seems straightforward, but let me think if this aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- \\(AB = 2\\), \\(BD = 3\\), and \\(CD = 8\\)\n- The positions seem consistent with the triangle and point \\(D\\) on line \\(AB\\)\n\nEverything checks out. So, \\(BD = 3\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Using Similar Triangles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's see if there's another way to verify this, just to be sure.\n\nMaybe \\( \\triangle BDC \\) is similar to another triangle, which could help find \\(BD\\) without needing coordinate geometry.\n\n**Identifying Similar Triangles:**\n\nIf \\( \\triangle BDC \\sim \\triangle FBA \\) (for some point \\(F\\)), then corresponding sides are proportional.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure about the similarity here without additional information or angles, especially since \\(D\\) is external to \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt seems that trying to apply similar triangles here isn't straightforward. Perhaps coordinate geometry was the right path after all.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, applying the Law of Cosines, and using coordinate geometry, I found:\n\n\\[\nBD = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- The calculation steps align with the problem's conditions.\n- The distance between \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) makes sense given the coordinates and triangle properties.\n- Alternate approaches didn't yield conflicting results, confirming the correctness.\n\nSo, the length \\(BD\\) is indeed **3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by listing possible strategies\u2014Law of Cosines, coordinate geometry, and similar triangles.\n- **Law of Cosines Attempt:** Successfully found the cosine of angle \\(C\\), but it didn't directly lead to \\(BD\\).\n- **Coordinate Geometry Approach:** Assigned coordinates, calculated \\(D\\)'s position, and found \\(BD\\) directly.\n- **Reflection and Checks:** Throughout, I checked calculations to ensure they made sense, adjusted strategies when needed, and verified the final answer.\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Considered similar triangles but realized it wasn't applicable here without additional information.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with continuous reflection and checking, led to the correct solution: **\\(BD = 3\\)**.",
