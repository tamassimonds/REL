    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step by step, just like how I would approach it if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approaches, check my work along the way, and make adjustments as needed. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem is asking for the value of \\(\\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9}\\). \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of the difference of squares formula, which states that \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\). I'm thinking maybe I can use that here to simplify the expression before dividing by 9.\n\n- **Alternative Thoughts:** Alternatively, I could calculate \\(109^2\\) and \\(100^2\\) directly, find their difference, and then divide by 9. But that seems more tedious. Perhaps there's a quicker way using the formula I mentioned.\n\n- **Checking Myself:** Using the difference of squares seems like a more efficient path. Let me explore that first.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Exploring the Difference of Squares Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven the formula \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\), I can identify:\n\n- \\(a = 109\\)\n- \\(b = 100\\)\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n109^2 - 100^2 = (109 - 100)(109 + 100)\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n109 - 100 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n109 + 100 = 209\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, multiplying these two results seems straightforward. Let's proceed.\n\n\\[\n(109 - 100)(109 + 100) = 9 \\times 209\n\\]\n\nMultiplying:\n\n\\[\n9 \\times 209 = 1881\n\\]\n\nBut wait\u2014I've only simplified \\(109^2 - 100^2\\) to 1881. The original expression is \\(\\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9}\\), so I need to divide this result by 9:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1881}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes 1881 divide evenly by 9? Let me check:\n\n\\[\n1881 \\div 9 = 209\n\\]\n\n**Natural Reflection:**\n\nHmm, 1881 divided by 9 gives 209. That seems reasonable. But before finalizing, let's double-check to ensure no mistakes were made along the way.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Verifying the Approach with a Different Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEven though the first method worked, let's verify by calculating \\(109^2\\) and \\(100^2\\) directly to ensure everything adds up correctly.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n109^2 = 11881\n\\]\n\\[\n100^2 = 10000\n\\]\n\nNow, find the difference:\n\n\\[\n11881 - 10000 = 1881\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, subtracting directly gives the same result as using the difference of squares. This confirms that the initial approach was correct. Let\u2019s proceed with dividing by 9:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1881}{9} = 209\n\\]\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\nBoth methods lead to the same result. This consistency suggests that the calculations are likely correct. It's always a good idea to check using different strategies to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nSo, whether I used the difference of squares formula or calculated \\(109^2\\) and \\(100^2\\) directly, the result consistently points to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9} = 209\n\\]\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nI feel confident in this result. By exploring different strategies\u2014first simplifying using a formula and then verifying by direct calculation\u2014I\u2019ve ensured that the correct answer is indeed **209**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThrough brainstorming various approaches, reflecting on each step, and verifying with multiple methods, I've determined that the value of \\(\\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9}\\) is **209**. This process highlights the importance of checking work and being open to adjusting strategies to achieve accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "The key to this problem is noticing that $109^2 - 100^2$ factors into $(109+100)(109-100)$. So, our fraction becomes $\\frac{(109+100)(109-100)}{9} = \\frac{209 \\cdot 9}{9}$, which simplifies to $\\boxed{209}$."
