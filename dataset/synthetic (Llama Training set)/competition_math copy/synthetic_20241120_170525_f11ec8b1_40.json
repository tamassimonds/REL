    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and see where it takes me. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way\u2014just like how I would tackle it in real life. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with a minor league baseball game where every 75th, 30th, and 50th fan receives coupons for free hot dogs, soda, and popcorn, respectively. The stadium holds 4,000 fans, and I need to figure out how many lucky fans received all three items.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **LCM Approach:** Maybe I can find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 75, 30, and 50 to determine how often a fan qualifies for all three coupons.\n- **Counting Multiples:** Alternatively, I could count the multiples of each number up to 4,000 and see where they overlap.\n- **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** This principle might help avoid double-counting fans who receive multiple coupons.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe LCM method seems like a straightforward starting point. If that doesn't work, I can explore the other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting with the LCM Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s try finding the LCM of 75, 30, and 50 to see how frequently a fan would receive all three coupons. If the LCM fits within 4,000, it should give me the count of such fans.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Find the Prime Factorization:**\n   - 75 = \\(3 \\times 5^2\\)\n   - 30 = \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)\n   - 50 = \\(2 \\times 5^2\\)\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Powers:**\n   - For 3: \\(3^1\\)\n   - For 5: \\(5^2\\)\n   - For 2: \\(2^1\\) (only in 30 and 50)\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM:**\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2\\)\n   - LCM = \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 25 = 150\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, the LCM is 150. This means every 150th fan receives all three items. Let\u2019s see how many fans this applies to within the 4,000 capacity.\n\n**Thought Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because being a multiple of 150 means a fan qualifies for all three coupons based on the other multiples (75, 30, and 50).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Number of Qualified Fans**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find out how many fans are multiples of 150 up to 4,000.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Number of Multiples:** \\( \\frac{4000}{150} = 26.67\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, I can't have a fraction of a fan. Let\u2019s round down to 26 because we're only considering whole fans.\n\n**Thought Check:**\n\nSo, there are 26 fans who received all three items. Does that seem reasonable? Let me quickly verify by multiplying back:\n\n- \\(150 \\times 26 = 3,900\\)\n- \\(150 \\times 27 = 4,050\\) (exceeds 4,000)\n\nPerfect, 3,900 is within the limit, and 4,050 exceeds it. So, 26 is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with Small Multiple Checks**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure my LCM approach is correct, let's pick a few multiples of 150 and see if they also qualify for the other coupons.\n\n**Checks:**\n\n1. **150:**  \n   - \\(150 \\div 75 = 2\\) \u2192 **Yes**\n   - \\(150 \\div 30 = 5\\) \u2192 **Yes**\n   - \\(150 \\div 50 = 3\\) \u2192 **Yes**\n\n2. **300 (150 \u00d7 2):**  \n   - \\(300 \\div 75 = 4\\) \u2192 **Yes**\n   - \\(300 \\div 30 = 10\\) \u2192 **Yes**\n   - \\(300 \\div 50 = 6\\) \u2192 **Yes**\n\n3. **450 (150 \u00d7 3):**  \n   - \\(450 \\div 75 = 6\\) \u2192 **Yes**\n   - \\(450 \\div 30 = 15\\) \u2192 **Yes**\n   - \\(450 \\div 50 = 9\\) \u2192 **Yes**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAll checks pass! Every multiple of 150 up to 4,000 also satisfies the conditions for 75, 30, and 50. This confirms that our LCM method is correct.\n\n**Thought Check:**\n\nIs there any other way to verify? I suppose I could use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, but since the LCM approach worked seamlessly, I\u2019ll stick with it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Number of Fans Receiving All Three Items:** 26\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nBy using the LCM method and verifying with sample checks, we've determined that **26 fans** at the game were lucky enough to receive all three free items.\n\n**Thought Check:**\n\nDoes the number seem reasonable considering the stadium capacity and the frequency of the coupons? Yes, 26 out of 4,000 is a small but plausible number, especially given the specific multiples involved.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies and successfully applying the LCM method, we've arrived at the answer: **26 fans** received all three coupons. Throughout the process, I ensured to reflect and verify each step, confirming the correctness of the approach and the final result.",

  "ground_truth": "We are asked to count the common multiples of $\\{75,30,50\\}$ among the positive integers less than or equal to $4000$.  Since $75=3\\cdot 5^2$, $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot 5$, and $50=2\\cdot 5^2$, the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2=150$.  Since every common multiple is divisible by the least common multiple, we may count the multiples of $150$ less than $4000$. We divide $4000$ by $150$ and find a quotient of $\\boxed{26}$."
