    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem just as we would when tackling it in real life\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, and adjusting our approach as needed. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d think through it step by step:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWhen I first read the question, **\"If 1562 were expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2, what would be the least possible sum of the exponents of these powers?\"**, I think it\u2019s asking for a way to write 1562 using unique powers of 2, such that the sum of the exponents is minimized.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Binary Representation:** This immediately reminds me of converting numbers to binary, where each digit represents a power of 2.\n- **Distinct Powers of 2:** That\u2019s a hint that we're dealing with binary, since each power of 2 can only be used once.\n- **Sum of Exponents:** Minimizing the sum of exponents translates to minimizing the number of non-zero bits in the binary representation.\n\nBut I realize I\u2019m not entirely sure if binary conversion alone will give me the minimal sum of exponents. Maybe there are other strategies too.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Convert to Binary:** Start by converting 1562 to its binary form to see the exponents and their sum.\n2. **Use Powers of 2 Formula:** Attempt to express 1562 as a sum of distinct powers of 2 by finding which powers fit.\n3. **Greedy Algorithm Approach:** Try subtracting the largest possible power of 2 until reaching zero and see the exponents\u2019 sum.\n\n**Reflection:** Converting to binary seems like the most straightforward method. However, I think checking with the greedy approach could validate the binary conversion.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Converting 1562 to Binary**\n\nLet\u2019s try the binary conversion method first.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I know that in binary, each place value represents a power of 2, starting from \\(2^0\\) on the right.\n- To convert 1562 to binary, I\u2019ll repeatedly divide by 2 and record the remainders.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1562 \\div 2 &= 781 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0 \\\\\n781 \\div 2 &= 390 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 1 \\\\\n390 \\div 2 &= 195 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0 \\\\\n195 \\div 2 &= 97 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 1 \\\\\n97 \\div 2 &= 48 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 1 \\\\\n48 \\div 2 &= 24 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0 \\\\\n24 \\div 2 &= 12 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0 \\\\\n12 \\div 2 &= 6 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0 \\\\\n6 \\div 2 &= 3 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0 \\\\\n3 \\div 2 &= 1 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 1 \\\\\n1 \\div 2 &= 0 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 1 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Binary Representation:**\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top, 1562 in binary is **11000011010**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Each '1' in the binary representation corresponds to a power of 2 that\u2019s included in the sum.\n- The positions of '1's indicate the exponents.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Exponents**\n\nNow, let\u2019s identify the exponents where the binary digits are '1':\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The binary string is 11000011010.\n- Starting from the right (least significant bit), count the positions where there\u2019s a '1'.\n\n**Positions:**\n- \\(2^{10} = 1024\\)\n- \\(2^{9} = 512\\)\n- \\(2^{6} = 64\\)\n- \\(2^{5} = 32\\)\n- \\(2^{3} = 8\\)\n- \\(2^{1} = 2\\)\n\n**Sum of Exponents:**\n\n\\[\n10 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 34\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This sum, 34, represents the least possible sum of the exponents when expressing 1562 as a sum of distinct powers of 2.\n- **But wait**, let me double-check if this aligns with the problem's requirement\u2014ensuring that each exponent is distinct and that their sum is minimized.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach with a Greedy Algorithm**\n\nTo ensure our binary conversion is correct, let\u2019s try a different method: the greedy algorithm approach.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Start with 1562 and subtract the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 1562.\n- Repeat this process with the remainder until it reaches zero.\n- Keep track of the exponents used and their sum.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Subtract \\(2^{10} = 1024\\):**\n   \\[\n   1562 - 1024 = 538\n   \\]\n2. **Subtract \\(2^{9} = 512\\):**\n   \\[\n   538 - 512 = 26\n   \\]\n3. **Subtract \\(2^{4} = 16\\):**\n   \\[\n   26 - 16 = 10\n   \\]\n4. **Subtract \\(2^{3} = 8\\):**\n   \\[\n   10 - 8 = 2\n   \\]\n5. **Subtract \\(2^{1} = 2\\):**\n   \\[\n   2 - 2 = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Exponents Used:**\n- \\(2^{10}\\)\n- \\(2^{9}\\)\n- \\(2^{4}\\)\n- \\(2^{3}\\)\n- \\(2^{1}\\)\n\n**Sum of Exponents:**\n\n\\[\n10 + 9 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 27\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Oh no!** This sum, 27, is different from our initial result of 34. There seems to be a discrepancy.\n- This suggests that the greedy algorithm approach might have missed some exponents or that the binary conversion needs re-evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Re-evaluating the Binary Conversion**\n\nLet\u2019s take another look at the binary representation to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Binary Representation Revisited:**\n\nFrom our previous binary conversion:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1562 \\div 2 &= 781 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0 \\\\\n781 \\div 2 &= 390 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 1 \\\\\n390 \\div 2 &= 195 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0 \\\\\n195 \\div 2 &= 97 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 1 \\\\\n97 \\div 2 &= 48 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 1 \\\\\n48 \\div 2 &= 24 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0 \\\\\n24 \\div 2 &= 12 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0 \\\\\n12 \\div 2 &= 6 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0 \\\\\n6 \\div 2 &= 3 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0 \\\\\n3 \\div 2 &= 1 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 1 \\\\\n1 \\div 2 &= 0 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 1 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Binary String Confirmed:** **11000011010**\n\n**Identifying Exponents Again:**\n- \\(2^{10} = 1024\\)\n- \\(2^{9} = 512\\)\n- \\(2^{6} = 64\\)\n- \\(2^{5} = 32\\)\n- \\(2^{3} = 8\\)\n- \\(2^{1} = 2\\)\n\n**Sum of Exponents Again:**\n\n\\[\n10 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 34\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- It appears that the binary conversion is correct, and the sum of exponents is indeed 34.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Investigating the Greedy Approach Discrepancy**\n\nGiven the inconsistency between the two methods, let\u2019s delve deeper into the greedy algorithm to identify where it might have gone wrong.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The greedy approach subtracted the largest powers of 2 sequentially, but perhaps it didn't account for combining smaller powers effectively to minimize the exponent sum.\n\n**Re-examining the Greedy Steps:**\n\n1. **Initially Subtracting Large Powers:**\n   - After subtracting \\(2^{10}\\) and \\(2^{9}\\), a significant portion of 1562 was reduced.\n   - However, continuing to \\(2^{4}\\) instead of \\(2^{6}\\) may have skipped higher exponents that could have been combined differently.\n\n2. **Possible Better Combination:**\n   - Perhaps instead of jumping to \\(2^{4}\\), adding smaller powers like \\(2^{3}\\) and \\(2^{1}\\) earlier could have reached the target more efficiently.\n\n**Alternative Greedy Steps:**\n\n1. **Subtract \\(2^{10} = 1024\\):**\n   \\[\n   1562 - 1024 = 538\n   \\]\n2. **Subtract \\(2^{9} = 512\\):**\n   \\[\n   538 - 512 = 26\n   \\]\n3. **Instead of \\(2^{4}\\), combine smaller exponents:**\n   - **Subtract \\(2^{4} = 16\\):**\n     \\[\n     26 - 16 = 10\n     \\]\n   - **Subtract \\(2^{3} = 8\\):**\n     \\[\n     10 - 8 = 2\n     \\]\n   - **Subtract \\(2^{1} = 2\\):**\n     \\[\n     2 - 2 = 0\n     \\]\n\n**Sum of Exponents This Time:**\n\n\\[\n10 + 9 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 27\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This alternative approach still yields a sum of 27, which is less than 34.\n- **Wait,** isn\u2019t the goal to minimize the sum of exponents? If 27 is lower than 34, does that mean the binary conversion is incorrect?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Validating the Correct Approach**\n\nTo resolve this discrepancy, let's consider the original problem's requirement: to express 1562 as a sum of **distinct powers of 2** with the **least possible sum of exponents**.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- **Binary Representation:** Represents the exact sum using distinct powers of 2.\n- **Greedy Approach Validates:** Subtracting powers sequentially ensures that each exponent is used only once.\n- **Sum Minimization:** Lower sums of exponents indicate fewer powers used, aligning with minimizing the exponent sum.\n\n**Final Verification:**\n- Comparing both methods, the greedy approach considering all possible combinations yields a sum of 27, which is indeed the minimum possible sum of exponents for 1562.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Correct Answer:** The least possible sum of the exponents is **27**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nThroughout this problem, **thinking step-by-step** and **validating approaches** was crucial. Initially, the binary conversion suggested a sum of 34, but the greedy algorithm revealed a more efficient solution with a sum of 27. This discrepancy highlighted the importance of **cross-checking methods** to ensure accuracy.\n\nBy **brainstorming different strategies**, **reflecting on each step**, and **adjusting approaches as needed**, we concluded that the least possible sum of exponents for expressing 1562 as a sum of distinct powers of 2 is **27**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe least possible sum of the exponents of the distinct powers of 2 that sum up to 1562 is **27**.\n\n---\n\nThere you go!

  "ground_truth": "By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 1562 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$.  To find this representation, we convert 1562 to binary form.  The largest power of $2$ less than 1562 is $2^{10}=1024$.  The difference between 1024 and 1562 is $538$. The largest power of 2 less than 538 is $2^9=512$.  The difference between 538 and 512 is 26.  The largest power of 2 less than 26 is $2^4=16$, which leaves us with $26-16=10$. Continuing the process, we get $2^3=8$ and $2^1=2$. So, we have found that $1562=2^{10}+2^9+2^4+2^3+2^1$.  The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\\boxed{27}$."
