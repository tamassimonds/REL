Specifically:\n\n- I have containers that **can hold 12 eggs each.**\n- **Two containers have only 11 eggs each.**\n- All other containers hold **12 eggs.**\n- I need to find the **smallest total number of eggs** I could have right now, knowing all these details.\n\n**Initial Recollection:**\nThis looks similar to problems involving divisibility and remainders, where you have a total divided by a certain number but with some exceptions. I might also consider using algebra to set up an equation, or perhaps think about the modulo operation because of the 12-egg containers.\n\nBut I also notice that since I need the total to be **more than 100**, and we're dealing with containers holding 12 eggs (or 11 in two cases), the total should be just above a multiple of 12, adjusted by the shortage of the two 11-egg containers.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Algebraic Approach:** Set up an equation to represent the total number of eggs, considering both 12-egg and 11-egg containers.\n   \n2. **Divisibility and Remainders:** Since most containers hold 12, maybe I can find a multiple of 12 and adjust for the two containers with 11 eggs.\n\n3. **Trial and Error:** Start with the smallest possible total above 100 and see if it fits the container constraints.\n\nWait, I think starting with **Algebraic Approach** might be cleaner, but let me keep the other methods in mind in case this doesn't pan out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Algebraic Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s define some variables:\n- Let \\( n \\) be the total number of containers.\n- Since two containers have 11 eggs each, the rest (\\( n - 2 \\)) have 12 eggs each.\n- I know the total number of eggs is more than 100.\n\nSo the equation for the total number of eggs (\\( E \\)) would be:\n\n\\[\nE = 11 \\times 2 + 12 \\times (n - 2)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[\nE = 22 + 12n - 24\n\\]\n\\[\nE = 12n - 2\n\\]\n\n**Realization:**\nThis equation makes sense because it accounts for the eggs in all containers. But to satisfy the condition of having **more than 100 eggs**, I need:\n\n\\[\n12n - 2 > 100\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( n \\):**\n\n\\[\n12n > 102\n\\]\n\\[\nn > \\frac{102}{12} = 8.5\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nSince \\( n \\) must be a whole number (you can't have half a container), the smallest integer \\( n \\) that satisfies this is **9**.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense with the total number of eggs:\n\n\\[\nE = 12 \\times 9 - 2 = 108 - 2 = 106\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Constraints:**\n- Total eggs: **106** (which is more than 100\u2014good).\n- Number of containers: **9**.\n- Two containers with **11 eggs each:** \\( 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\).\n- Remaining containers (\\( 9 - 2 = 7 \\)) with **12 eggs each:** \\( 7 \\times 12 = 84 \\).\n- Total: \\( 22 + 84 = 106 \\)\u2014matches our calculation.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis approach seems correct. The number of containers and the total eggs align with all the given conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Divisibility and Remainders Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s see if thinking about multiples of 12 helps, considering the two containers with 11 eggs each affect the total.\n\n1. **Find the nearest multiple of 12 above 100:**\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 8 = 96 \\quad (\\text{too low, need more than 100})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 9 = 108 \\quad (\\text{just above 100\u2014good})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Adjust for the two 11-egg containers:**\n   Each 11-egg container is **1 less** than a 12-egg container, so two such containers are **2 eggs less** than two 12-egg containers.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference: } 2 \\times (12 - 11) = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the total number of eggs would be:\n\n   \\[\n   108 - 2 = 106\n   \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Total eggs: **106**\u2014same as before.\n- This matches the previous method, reinforcing that the solution is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis method also leads to the same answer and serves as a good verification.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Trial and Error Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s try a simpler way by making educated guesses starting from the smallest possible total above 100 and adjusting based on the container constraints.\n\n1. **Start with 101 eggs:**\n   - Total should ideally be a multiple of 12 adjusted by 2 (because of the two 11-egg containers).\n   - But 101 isn\u2019t close to 12; let's check if it can fit.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of 12-egg containers needed: } \\frac{101 + 2}{12} = \\frac{103}{12} \\approx 8.58\n   \\]\n   \n   This isn\u2019t an integer, so it's impossible to have 101 eggs with the given container setup.\n\n2. **Try 102 eggs:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{102 + 2}{12} = \\frac{104}{12} \\approx 8.67\n   \\]\n   \n   Still not an integer.\n\n3. **Continue to 103 eggs:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{103 + 2}{12} = \\frac{105}{12} = 8.75\n   \\]\n   \n   Again, not an integer.\n\n4. **Proceed to 104 eggs:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{104 + 2}{12} = \\frac{106}{12} = 8.83\n   \\]\n   \n   Still not an integer.\n\n5. **Finally, try 106 eggs:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{106 + 2}{12} = \\frac{108}{12} = 9\n   \\]\n   \n   This is an integer, meaning it\u2019s possible to have 9 containers with this total.\n\n**Check:**\n- Number of containers: **9**.\n- Two containers with 11 eggs: \\( 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\).\n- Seven containers with 12 eggs: \\( 7 \\times 12 = 84 \\).\n- Total: \\( 22 + 84 = 106 \\)\u2014matches our earlier calculations.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis method took longer and required more steps, but it arrived at the same correct answer by verifying multiple totals.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check and Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s ensure everything aligns and that there are no inconsistencies.\n\n1. **Total Number of Eggs:**\n   - **106 eggs**\u2014more than 100, as required.\n\n2. **Container Distribution:**\n   - **9 total containers:**\n     - **2 containers** with **11 eggs each:** \\( 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\).\n     - **7 containers** with **12 eggs each:** \\( 7 \\times 12 = 84 \\).\n     - **Total:** \\( 22 + 84 = 106 \\)\u2014matches the total eggs.\n\n3. **Constraints Satisfied:**\n   - More than 100 eggs.\n   - Correct number of containers, with the specified egg count per container.\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The solution is consistent across different approaches, confirming its correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming and exploring various strategies\u2014algebraic setup, considering divisibility and remainders, and trial and error\u2014I determined that the **smallest number of eggs you could have is **106.**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- **106 eggs**\n\nBy checking and reflecting at each step, I ensured that the approach was correct and aligned with all the problem's constraints. This methodical checking helped catch any possible miscalculations early, leading to a confident and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "If the two containers that held 11 eggs each held 12 eggs, then the number of eggs that you have would have been a multiple of 12. However, two eggs were removed, so the number of eggs you can have is two less than a multiple of 12. Therefore, the number of eggs you could have can be written in the form $12c-2$, where $c$ represents the number of containers you have. As a result, we would like to solve the inequality $12c-2 > 100$, which has solution $c > 8\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, since the number of containers must be an integer, we must have $c=9$, so the smallest number of eggs you could have right now is $12(9) - 2 = \\boxed{106}$."
