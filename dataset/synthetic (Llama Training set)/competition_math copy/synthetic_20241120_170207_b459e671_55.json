Let's tackle this problem just like I would if I were solving it myself\u2014brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work frequently, and being open to adjusting my approach if something doesn\u2019t seem right. I'll also make sure to write down all my thoughts, including any confusion or \"aha\" moments, to make the thought process clear.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem:\n\n\\[2002 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2001 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2000 + \\dots + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 3 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\right) \\right) \\dotsb \\right)\\]\n\nThis expression seems to involve nested fractional additions. Here are my initial thoughts:\n\n- **Nested Structure:** It reminds me of problems involving infinite series or recursive sequences.\n- **Fractional Coefficients:** The presence of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) repeatedly suggests that each term is being halved, which might hint at convergence if it's infinite.\n- **Base Value:** Starting with 2002 and descending to 2 makes me think there's a decreasing pattern or summation involved.\n\nAt this point, I'm not entirely sure how to proceed. I remember working with similar problems where recursive definitions or telescoping sums were involved. Maybe I can use those strategies here.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Unfolding the Nesting:**\n   - Try to simplify the expression by removing one layer of nesting at a time.\n   - Write out the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n2. **Recursive Definition:**\n   - Define the entire expression as a function and explore if there's a recursive relationship.\n   - See if this leads to a closed form.\n\n3. **Geometric Series Insight:**\n   - Since each term is halved, perhaps the sum resembles a geometric series.\n   - Check if summing a geometric series can apply here.\n\nLet me explore these strategies one by one.\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Unfold the Nesting**\n\nLet\u2019s start by rewriting the expression to see if I can simplify it layer by layer.\n\n**First Layer:**\n\\[\n2002 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2001 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2000 + \\dots \\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\nOkay, let's try to unfold just the innermost parts:\n\n\\[\n= 2002 + \\frac{1}{2} (2001 + \\frac{1}{2} (2000 + \\dots))\n\\]\n\nWait, that looks just as messy. Maybe unpacking it layer by layer isn't the best approach because it keeps going and looks complicated.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis looks like it could take forever. I can't just keep peeling layers without seeing a clear pattern. **Hmm, maybe there's a better way.**\n\n### **Step 2: Recursive Definition Approach**\n\nThinking about it again, maybe defining the entire thing recursively could help. Let me set up a function:\n\n\\[\nS_n = n + \\frac{1}{2} S_{n-1}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(S_n\\) is the sum starting from \\(n\\) down to 2.\n- \\(S_{n-1}\\) is the sum starting from \\(n-1\\) down to 2.\n\nWait, but how do I compute \\(S_{n-1}\\) recursively without getting stuck? **Hmm, I need a base case.**\n\n**Base Case:**\n\\[\nS_2 = 2\n\\]\n(since \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1\\) doesn't count as there's no term below 2)\n\nBut then I realize... **this looks recursive but still might not lead directly to a simple solution. Maybe I need another approach.**\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Geometric Series**\n\nMaybe there's a geometric series aspect here because of the repeated \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Let me write out the first few terms to see.\n\n**Writing Out the Expression:**\n\\[\nS = 2002 + \\frac{1}{2} (2001 + \\frac{1}{2} (2000 + \\dots + \\frac{1}{2} (3 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 ) \\dotsb ))\n\\]\n\nLet's consider just the first few terms:\n\n- \\(2002\\)\n- \\(+\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2001\\)\n- \\(+\\frac{1}{4} \\times 2000\\)\n- \\(+\\frac{1}{8} \\times 1999\\)\n- \\(+\\frac{1}{16} \\times 1998\\)\n- \\(+\\frac{1}{32} \\times 1997\\)\n- \\(+\\frac{1}{64} \\times 1996\\)\n- \\(\\dots\\)\n\n**Pattern Observation:**\n- Each term is halved from the previous one.\n- The coefficients are powers of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis does look like a geometric series where each term's coefficient is halved. But... **wait, there's nesting. So, each term includes another series inside it. That complicates things.**\n\n### **Step 4: Realizing the Need for a Different Approach**\n\nIt seems like attempting to unroll the nesting or applying geometric series directly isn't working effectively because of the multiple layers. **Hmm, maybe there's a trick with infinite series or telescoping sums that I'm missing. Let me think about it.**\n\n### **Step 5: Considering Infinite Geometric Series for Convergence**\n\nIf the series were infinite, I would need to consider convergence. A geometric series converges if the absolute value of the common ratio is less than 1. Here, the common ratio is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), which is less than 1.\n\n**But, is our series infinite?**\n- The series stops at 2, so it\u2019s not technically infinite.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis might still hint at a geometric series because the coefficients behave like that, but the nesting complicates direct application. **Maybe there's an underlying pattern resembling a convergent series.**\n\n### **Step 6: Attempting a Different Strategy\u2014Factor Out Common Terms**\n\nLet\u2019s consider factoring out common terms to see if that simplifies the nested structure.\n\n**First Few Terms Unpacked:**\n\\[\nS = 2002 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2001 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times 2000 + \\frac{1}{8} \\times 1999 + \\frac{1}{16} \\times 1998 + \\dots\n\\]\n\n**Factoring Out Coefficients:**\nLet me try grouping the terms based on their coefficients:\n\n\\[\n= 2002 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2001\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 2000\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{8} \\times 1999\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{16} \\times 1998\\right) + \\dots\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis still looks messy. I don\u2019t see a clear pattern or simplification here. **Maybe I need another angle.**\n\n### **Step 7: Redefining the Series Using Indexing**\n\nLet\u2019s try defining the terms with indices to see if a pattern emerges:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{k=0}^{m} \\frac{1}{2^k} \\times (2002-k)\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(m\\) is the number of terms until we reach 2. But I'm not sure how to set \\(m\\) precisely without adding complexity. **Wait, this might overcomplicate things.**\n\n### **Step 8: Looking for Telescoping Patterns**\n\nIs there a telescoping pattern where successive terms cancel each other out? Let me think...\n\n**Thinking:**\n- Each term involves halving and adding the next term.\n- Maybe there\u2019s a cancellation happening between terms.\n\n**Reflection:**\nBut telescoping usually requires straightforward subtraction among terms, which isn't the case here because of the nesting. **Hmm, this doesn't seem applicable.**\n\n### **Step 9: Returning to the Recursive Approach with Simplification**\n\nI think I need to revisit the recursive approach but simplify it to avoid getting stuck.\n\n**Defining the Function Again:**\n\n\\[\nS_n = n + \\frac{1}{2} S_{n-1}\n\\]\n\n**Base case:**\n\n\\[\nS_2 = 2\n\\]\n\n**Calculating Few Terms:**\n\n- \\(S_3 = 3 + \\frac{1}{2} S_2 = 3 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = 3 + 1 = 4\\)\n- \\(S_4 = 4 + \\frac{1}{2} S_3 = 4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 4 + 2 = 6\\)\n- \\(S_5 = 5 + \\frac{1}{2} S_4 = 5 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 = 5 + 3 = 8\\)\n\n**Pattern Observed:**\n- The sequence seems to be increasing by 2 each time.\n\n**Formula Derivation:**\nMaybe I can find a closed formula based on this pattern.\n\n\\[\nS_n = 2n - 2\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- For \\(n = 2\\): \\(S_2 = 2 \\times 2 - 2 = 2\\)\n- For \\(n = 3\\): \\(S_3 = 2 \\times 3 - 2 = 4\\)\n- For \\(n = 4\\): \\(S_4 = 2 \\times 4 - 2 = 6\\)\n- For \\(n = 5\\): \\(S_5 = 2 \\times 5 - 2 = 8\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems to fit the recursive calculations. **Hmm, maybe this is the right path.**\n\n### **Step 10: Applying the Formula to Calculate \\(S_{2002}\\)**\n\nNow, let's apply this formula to find \\(S_{2002}\\):\n\n\\[\nS_{2002} = 2 \\times 2002 - 2 = 4004 - 2 = 4002\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Let\u2019s see:\n\n- The pattern suggests that each \\(n\\) adds a multiple of 2, starting from \\(S_2 = 2\\).\n- So, \\(S_{2002} = 2 \\times 2002 - 2 = 4002\\), which follows the pattern.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe formula seems consistent with the recursive approach. **I think this is correct. But let me double-check a couple of terms to be sure.**\n\n### **Step 11: Verifying the Formula with More Terms**\n\nLet\u2019s verify the formula by calculating a few more terms:\n\n- \\(S_6 = 6 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 6 + 4 = 10\\)\n  \nAccording using the formula:\n\\[\nS_6 = 2 \\times 6 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10\n\\]\n  \n**Check:**\nBoth methods agree. **This adds confidence to the formula.**\n\n### **Step 12: Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014unfolding the nesting, defining a recursive function, and recognizing a pattern resembling a linear sequence\u2014I believe the most effective approach was to derive a closed formula from the recursive relationships:\n\n\\[\nS_n = 2n - 2\n\\]\n\nApplying this to the original problem:\n\n\\[\nS_{2002} = 2 \\times 2002 - 2 = 4004 - 2 = 4002\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n- The formula fits the base case and several recursive steps.\n- Sample calculations align with the formula.\n- The pattern consistently increments by 2 for each \\(n\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe value of the expression is **4002**.\n\n**Final Thought:**\nIt\u2019s always useful to look for patterns and verify through multiple strategies. Initially, attempting to unroll the nesting seemed daunting, but by recognizing the recursive pattern and deriving a formula, I could simplify the problem effectively. Checking the formula with various terms ensured its correctness before applying it to the final calculation.\n\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough aligns with your expectations!
