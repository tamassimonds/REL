    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where it takes us. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work often, and make sure to reflect on whether each step makes sense. Let's approach this like a human would\u2014exploring, making mistakes, and having \"aha\" moments along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWhen I first glance at the problem, **Rationalize the denominator of \\(\\frac{5}{2+\\sqrt{6}}\\)**, I recall that rationalizing the denominator typically involves eliminating any irrational numbers from the denominator. This reminds me of similar problems I've encountered before, where multiplying by a conjugate is a common strategy. \n\nBut wait, let me think: Is multiplying by the conjugate always the best approach? Are there other methods to consider? Maybe I could simplify the fraction in a different way, but the standard procedure is usually to deal with the irrational part directly.\n\n**Initial Action:** Let's start by trying to multiply by the conjugate of the denominator, which seems like the most straightforward method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Multiplying by the Conjugate**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo rationalize the denominator, I'll multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of \\(2 + \\sqrt{6}\\). The conjugate is \\(2 - \\sqrt{6}\\) because it changes the sign of the irrational part.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{2+\\sqrt{6}} \\times \\frac{2-\\sqrt{6}}{2-\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{5(2-\\sqrt{6})}{(2+\\sqrt{6})(2-\\sqrt{6})}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Denominator:**\n\n\\[\n(2+\\sqrt{6})(2-\\sqrt{6}) = 2^2 - (\\sqrt{6})^2 = 4 - 6 = -2\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Numerator:**\n\n\\[\n5(2 - \\sqrt{6}) = 10 - 5\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\n**Resulting Expression:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 - 5\\sqrt{6}}{-2}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Further:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{-2} - \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{-2} = -5 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait a minute. The problem asks for the answer in the form \\(\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}+C}{D}\\). My current expression is \\(-5 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2}\\), which doesn't exactly fit that format. Maybe I can rearrange it to align better with the required form.\n\n**Rearranging:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2} - 5 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2} - \\frac{10}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{6} - 10}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Final Expression:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5\\sqrt{6} - 10}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nThis looks closer to the expected form \\(\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}+C}{D}\\), where \\(A = 5\\), \\(B = 6\\), \\(C = -10\\), and \\(D = 2\\). But let's double-check to ensure everything fits the criteria:\n\n- **A, B, C, D are integers:** Check.\n- **D is positive:** Check.\n- **B is not divisible by the square of any prime:** Check, since 6 = 2 \u00d7 3, and neither 2 nor 3 is a perfect square.\n- **GCD(A, C, D) = 1:** Let's verify this.\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(5, -10, 2) = 1 \\quad (\\text{since} \\, \\text{GCD}(5, 2) = 1 \\, \\text{and} \\, 2 \\, \\text{divides} \\, -10)\n\\]\n\n**Everything seems to check out.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing the answer, it's essential to verify that the rationalization was done correctly and that the final expression meets all the problem's requirements.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Denominator Rationalized:** From \\(-2\\) to \\(2\\), and the irrational part eliminated? Check.\n- **Numerator Simplified Correctly:** Terms combined and simplified? Check.\n- **Form \\(\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}+C}{D}\\):** Matches the required format? Check.\n\n**But...** Is there another way to confirm this? Maybe I can plug the original fraction and the final expression into a calculator to see if they are equivalent.\n\n**Alternative Verification:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{2+\\sqrt{6}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -5 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating Decimal Approximations:**\n\nOriginal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{2+\\sqrt{6}} \\approx \\frac{5}{4.449} \\approx 1.125\n\\]\n\nFinal Expression:\n\n\\[\n-5 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2} \\approx -5 + 6.123 \\approx 1.125\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\nBoth expressions are approximately equal, confirming that the rationalization was done correctly.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis alternative verification reassures me that the steps taken were accurate. It's always good to have multiple methods to check the validity of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Finalizing the Answer**\n\nFrom the final expression, we identified:\n\n\\[\nA = 5, \\quad B = 6, \\quad C = -10, \\quad D = 2\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(A + B + C + D\\):**\n\n\\[\n5 + 6 - 10 + 2 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nThroughout this process, I started by considering the standard method of multiplying by the conjugate, which led me to the correct path. Along the way, I ensured that the final expression matched the required format and verified the correctness by comparing decimal approximations of both the original and final expressions.\n\nIt's crucial to check each step and be open to adjusting the approach if something doesn't seem right. In this case, verifying the GCD and doing a quick decimal check provided confidence that the solution was accurate.\n\nBy keeping the thought process transparent and reflecting consistently, I was able to navigate through the problem effectively, just like a human would\u2014exploring, checking, and ensuring correctness at every stage.",
