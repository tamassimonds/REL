    "working_out": "### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we have three variables, \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), all positive. We're given three equations involving products of these variables:\n\n- \\(xy = 24\\)\n- \\(xz = 48\\)\n- \\(yz = 72\\)\n\nThe goal is to find the sum \\(x + y + z\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Product Relationships:** At first glance, these seem like equations relating the products of two variables at a time. Maybe I can relate them to find individual values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\n- **Systems of Equations:** This reminds me of systems of equations where we need to solve for multiple unknowns.\n\n- **Square of the Sum:** I recall that sometimes the square of the sum of variables can relate to products; perhaps there's a way to use that here.\n\n- **Substitution Method:** Maybe I can express one variable in terms of another and substitute it into the other equations.\n\n- **Cross-Multiplication:** Alternatively, cross-multiplying the equations might eliminate variables and help solve for the others.\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\n\nBut before diving in, **reflecting**, I wonder if there's a pattern or a property I might be overlooking. Perhaps there's a more straightforward relationship between the variables that could simplify the process.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies\n\n**Strategy 1: Solving for Individual Variables Using Substitution**\n\nI could try solving one of the equations for one variable and substituting it into the others to find the remaining variables.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- From \\(xy = 24\\), I can express \\(y = \\frac{24}{x}\\).\n- Substituting \\(y\\) into \\(yz = 72\\) gives \\(z = \\frac{72}{y} = \\frac{72}{\\frac{24}{x}} = \\frac{72x}{24} = 3x\\).\n- Now, with \\(z = 3x\\), substitute into \\(xz = 48\\): \\(x(3x) = 48 \\implies 3x^2 = 48 \\implies x^2 = 16 \\implies x = 4\\) (since \\(x\\) is positive).\n\n**Checking:**\n\nHmm, that seems reasonable so far. But let\u2019s see if this approach consistently leads to correct values.\n\n**Continuing:**\n\n- If \\(x = 4\\), then \\(y = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\).\n- And \\(z = 3(4) = 12\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify if these values satisfy all three original equations:\n\n1. \\(xy = 4 \\times 6 = 24\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n2. \\(xz = 4 \\times 12 = 48\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n3. \\(yz = 6 \\times 12 = 72\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nPerfect! All equations are satisfied. This method seems to work well.\n\n**Strategy 2: Using the Relationship between Products and Squares**\n\nAnother approach could be to utilize the products to find \\( (x + y + z)^2 \\) directly and then solve for \\(x + y + z\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Recall that \\( (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + xz + yz) \\).\n- We have \\( xy = 24 \\), \\( xz = 48 \\), and \\( yz = 72 \\), so \\( xy + xz + yz = 24 + 48 + 72 = 144 \\).\n- However, we don't directly have \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\), and calculating it might be complex without knowing individual variables.\n\n**Wait, That Can't Be Right:**\n\nThinking about it, without knowing \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\), this approach would lead to an additional unknown, making it more complicated. So, perhaps I should stick with the first strategy.\n\n### Step 3: Finalizing the Solution\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven that the substitution method reliably provided values satisfying all original equations, I'll proceed with those:\n\n- \\(x = 4\\)\n- \\(y = 6\\)\n- \\(z = 12\\)\n\n**Calculating \\(x + y + z\\):**\n\n\\[\nx + y + z = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s ensure that the sum \\(x + y + z = 22\\) aligns with all initial conditions:\n\n- **Does it satisfy \\(xy = 24\\)?**\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 6 = 24 \\quad \u2714\ufe0f\n  \\]\n  \n- **Does it satisfy \\(xz = 48\\)?**\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 12 = 48 \\quad \u2714\ufe0f\n  \\]\n  \n- **Does it satisfy \\(yz = 72\\)?**\n  \\[\n  6 \\times 12 = 72 \\quad \u2714\ufe0f\n  \\]\n\nAll conditions are satisfied, confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\n### Final Reflection:\n\nInitially, I considered multiple strategies, including substitution and examining the relationship between the sums and products. The substitution method proved straightforward and effective, leading to consistent values that satisfied all equations. While exploring the alternative approach involving squares seemed promising, it became clear that without additional information, it would complicate the problem unnecessarily. \n\nBy regularly checking the correctness at each stage, I ensured the validity of the solution, arriving confidently at \\(x + y + z = 22\\).\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step approach, complete with brainstorming, reflecting, and checking, aligns with the detailed human-like thinking you're looking for. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!",

  "ground_truth": "Since $$x=\\frac{24}{y}=\\frac{48}{z}$$ we have $z = 2y$. So $72\n= 2y^2$, which implies that $y=6$, $x = 4$, and $z = 12$. Hence $x+y+z = \\boxed{22}$."
