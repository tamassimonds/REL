    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. I\u2019ll approach it as I naturally would when tackling a math problem, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work regularly.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I notice that it's about **Betty buying flour and sugar** with specific **constraints** on the amounts of each. Here\u2019s what jumps out at me:\n\n- **Flour Constraints**: \n  - At least 6 pounds more than half the sugar.\n  - No more than twice the sugar.\n  \n- **Objective**: Find the **least number of pounds** of sugar Betty could buy.\n\nMy initial reaction is that this involves setting up **inequalities** because there are minimum and maximum relationships between the amounts of flour and sugar. It feels similar to problems where you deal with ratios and bounds.\n\nBut then I think, \"**Wait, are there multiple possible amounts of sugar?** Maybe I need to explore different scenarios to find the minimum.\"\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Set Up Inequalities**: \n   - Use the given relationships to create mathematical inequalities.\n   \n2. **Graphical Approach**:\n   - Plot the inequalities to find the feasible region.\n   \n3. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Plug in different sugar amounts to see which ones satisfy all conditions.\n\nLet me start with **setting up inequalities** because that seems like a straightforward mathematical approach. If it gets too complicated, I can switch to a graphical method or trial and error.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Inequalities**\n\nLet\u2019s define the variables:\n\n- Let \\( S \\) = pounds of sugar\n- Let \\( F \\) = pounds of flour\n\nGiven:\n\n1. **At least 6 pounds more than half the sugar**:\n   \\[ F \\geq \\frac{1}{2}S + 6 \\]\n   \n2. **No more than twice the sugar**:\n   \\[ F \\leq 2S \\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}S + 6 \\leq F \\leq 2S \\]\n\nHmm, this looks like there are two boundaries for \\( F \\). I should consider how these intersect with each other and what constraints they place on \\( S \\).\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Relationship Between \\( F \\) and \\( S \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s see how these inequalities interact. Since \\( F \\) must be at least \\( \\frac{1}{2}S + 6 \\) and at most \\( 2S \\), I think I need to find a common **range for \\( S \\)** that satisfies both.\n\nTo do this, I'll **substitute \\( F \\) with its boundaries** and see what conditions apply to \\( S \\).\n\n#### **Substituting the Lower Bound of \\( F \\)**\n\nFrom the lower bound: \n\\[ F \\geq \\frac{1}{2}S + 6 \\]\n\nBut also, since \\( F \\leq 2S \\), we can set up:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}S + 6 \\leq 2S \\]\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Inequality**\n\nLet\u2019s solve for \\( S \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}S + 6 \\leq 2S\n\\]\n\nFirst, subtract \\( \\frac{1}{2}S \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n6 \\leq 2S - \\frac{1}{2}S\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6 \\leq \\frac{3}{2}S\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\):\n\n\\[\nS \\geq 6 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 4\n\\]\n\nOkay, this tells me that **sugar must be at least 4 pounds**. But wait, does this make sense? Let me think...\n\n### **Reflection: Does \\( S = 4 \\) Work?**\n\nIf \\( S = 4 \\):\n\n- Lower Bound for \\( F \\):\n  \\[\n  F \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8\n  \\]\n  \n- Upper Bound for \\( F \\):\n  \\[\n  F \\leq 2 \\times 4 = 8\n  \\]\n  \nSo, \\( F \\) must be exactly 8 pounds. This seems compatible\u2014both inequalities are satisfied. Hmm, maybe 4 is indeed the minimum sugar amount.\n\nBut let me **double-check** by considering another approach to ensure it's correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Alternative Approach\u2014Graphical Method**\n\nLet\u2019s think about graphing the inequalities to visually confirm the solution.\n\n- **Inequality 1**: \\( F = \\frac{1}{2}S + 6 \\) (dotted line, since \\( F \\) must be greater than or equal)\n- **Inequality 2**: \\( F = 2S \\) (solid line, since \\( F \\) must be less than or equal)\n\nThe overlapping region of these two lines will give me the feasible values for \\( F \\) and \\( S \\).\n\n#### **Intersecting the Lines**\n\nLet\u2019s find the point where these two lines intersect:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}S + 6 = 2S\n\\]\n\nWait, I already solved this earlier:\n\n\\[\n6 = \\frac{3}{2}S \\implies S = 4\n\\]\n\nSo, the intersection point is \\( S = 4 \\). The corresponding \\( F \\) value is:\n\n\\[\nF = 2S = 8\n\\]\n\nHmm, this matches what I got earlier. It\u2019s reassuring to see that both methods lead to the same point.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s verify that \\( S = 4 \\) satisfies all conditions:\n\n- **Lower Bound for \\( F \\)**:\n  \\[\n  F \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8\n  \\]\n  \n- **Upper Bound for \\( F \\)**:\n  \\[\n  F \\leq 2 \\times 4 = 8\n  \\]\n  \nBoth conditions are satisfied with \\( F = 8 \\). Therefore, **\\( S = 4 \\) is indeed the correct solution**.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nInitially, I thought I might need to explore multiple strategies, but setting up and solving the inequalities directly worked well. Checking the solution with an alternative method (graphing) confirmed its correctness. \n\nIt's always good to **reflect and verify** when solving such problems, ensuring that all conditions are met and that the solution is consistent across different approaches.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**The least number of pounds of sugar that Betty could buy is **4** pounds.**\n\nBy brainstorming, setting up inequalities, and verifying through multiple methods, I was able to confidently determine the minimum sugar amount required for Betty's purchase.",

  "ground_truth": "Suppose Betty buys $f$ pounds of flour and $s$ pounds of sugar.  From the problem, we have $f \\ge 6+s/2$ and $f \\le 2s$.  Putting these together, we have $2s \\ge f \\ge 6 +s/2$. The expression on the left end of this inequality chain must therefore be greater than or equal to the $6+s/2$ on the right, so \\[2s \\ge 6 + s/2 \\implies 3s/2 \\ge 6 \\implies s\\ge \\boxed{4}.\\]"
