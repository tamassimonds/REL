It's important to approach this like a human would, reflecting often, checking my work, and being open to changing methods if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the question asks how many odd whole numbers are factors of 180. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This seems to involve finding factors of 180, but only the odd ones. I remember that factors are numbers that divide evenly into the original number. \n- **Possible Strategies:** I could list all factors of 180 and then filter out the odd ones. Alternatively, I could use prime factorization to find odd factors more efficiently. Maybe there\u2019s a pattern or a mathematical property I can leverage.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Listing Factors:** This might be time-consuming but straightforward.\n- **Prime Factorization:** Could help identify odd factors directly by only considering the odd primes.\n- **Using Formulas or Patterns:** There might be a formula involving exponents in prime factorization that can count odd factors.\n\n**Wait a minute**, I think using prime factorization will be more efficient than listing all factors. It\u2019ll directly show me the odd factors without needing to filter later.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting Prime Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s give prime factorization a try. I\u2019ll break down 180 into its prime components.\n\n- **Starting Point:** \n    - I know that 180 is an even number, so it must have 2 as one of its prime factors.\n    - Let's divide 180 by 2: \\( 180 \u00f7 2 = 90 \\)\n    - Now, 90 is still even, so divide by 2 again: \\( 90 \u00f7 2 = 45 \\)\n    - Now, 45 is odd, so I stop here with the factor of 2.\n  \n    So far, I have:  \n    \\( 180 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 45 \\)\n\n- **Breaking Down 45:**\n    - 45 is odd, so I can\u2019t divide by 2 anymore.\n    - Let\u2019s try dividing by the next smallest prime, which is 3: \n      \\( 45 \u00f7 3 = 15 \\)\n    - 15 is still divisible by 3: \\( 15 \u00f7 3 = 5 \\)\n    - Now, 5 is a prime number.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAt this point, I have fully factorized 180:  \n\\( 180 = 2^2 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5 \\)\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense?  \n- **Multiplying Back:** Let\u2019s multiply it out to verify:  \n  \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)  \n  \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)  \n  \\( 4 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 5 = 180 \\)\n\n**Verdict:**  \nYup, that checks out. The prime factorization seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Odd Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find the odd factors. From the prime factorization, I notice that 2 is the only even prime factor. **Ah,** this means that odd factors must only include the odd primes (3 and 5 in this case).\n\n- **Ignoring Even Primes:** To find odd factors, I can ignore the exponent of 2 (since including it would make the factor even).\n\n- **Using Exponents:**\n    - Each odd prime factor\u2019s exponent can range from 0 up to its actual exponent in the prime factorization.\n  \n    - **For 3:** Exponent is 2, so possible exponents are 0, 1, 2.\n    - **For 5:** Exponent is 1, so possible exponents are 0, 1.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe number of combinations of exponents for the odd prime factors can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each prime:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Odd Factors} = (\\text{Exponents of 3} + 1) \u00d7 (\\text{Exponents of 5} + 1) = (2 + 1) \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Wait a second,** let me double-check this. Am I only considering the odd primes and their exponents correctly?\n\n**Check:**  \nYes, I\u2019m only considering 3 and 5, ignoring the exponent of 2.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Listing the Odd Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let\u2019s list out the odd factors based on the exponent combinations:\n\n- **Exponent Combinations:**\n    - For 3: 0, 1, 2\n    - For 5: 0, 1\n\n- **Building Factors:**\n    - \\( 3^0 \u00d7 5^0 = 1 \\)\n    - \\( 3^0 \u00d7 5^1 = 5 \\)\n    - \\( 3^1 \u00d7 5^0 = 3 \\)\n    - \\( 3^1 \u00d7 5^1 = 15 \\)\n    - \\( 3^2 \u00d7 5^0 = 9 \\)\n    - \\( 3^2 \u00d7 5^1 = 45 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo the odd factors are: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45\n\n**Check:**  \nLet\u2019s count them:  \n1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45 \u2192 **Total: 6**\n\n**Does this match our earlier calculation?**  \nYes, both methods yield 6 odd factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let\u2019s ensure that all steps make sense and that there are no errors.\n\n- **Prime Factorization Check:**  \n  \\( 2^2 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5 = 180 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **Odd Factors Calculation:**  \n  Only considering exponents of odd primes (3 and 5) \u2192 6 combinations \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **Listing Odd Factors:**  \n  Matches the expected count and includes all possible combinations \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The prime factorization approach was efficient, and listing the odd factors confirmed the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming different strategies and reflecting at each step, I determined that there are **6 odd whole number factors** of 180. Using prime factorization simplified the process by allowing me to focus solely on the odd primes, and verifying through listing ensured accuracy.",
