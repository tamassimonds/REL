    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking through it just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, exploring what's working, and reflecting often to make sure I'm on the right track. I\u2019ll write down my thoughts, show any mistakes, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( 2x - y = 5 \\)\n2. \\( x + 2y = 5 \\)\n\nAnd the goal is to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\nWhen I see two equations like this, it reminds me of systems of linear equations I've dealt with before. The usual methods are substitution, elimination, or maybe even graphing. But honestly, I\u2019m not sure which one will be the easiest right off the bat. Let's brainstorm a bit.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n- **Substitution Method:** Solve one equation for \\( y \\) or \\( x \\) and plug it into the other.\n- **Elimination Method:** Try to eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting the equations.\n- **Graphing:** Plot both equations on a graph and see where they intersect.\n- **Matrix Method:** Use matrices to solve the system, but that feels like overkill for this simple problem.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGraphing seems a bit too time-consuming for a quick check, and matrices might complicate things unnecessarily. Substitution and elimination are the most straightforward. I think substitution might be cleaner, but let's see what feels right.\n\n**Checking the Initial Approach:**\n\nLet\u2019s try the substitution method first. If it gets messy, I can switch to elimination.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Trying Substitution Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSubstitution involves solving one equation for either \\( x \\) or \\( y \\) and then plugging that into the other equation. I\u2019ll start with the first equation and solve for \\( y \\).\n\n**Solving for \\( y \\):**\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\\[ 2x - y = 5 \\]\n\nLet me isolate \\( y \\):\n\\[ -y = 5 - 2x \\]\n\\[ y = 2x - 5 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. Now I have \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\). Time to plug this into the second equation.\n\n**Plugging into Equation 2:**\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n\\[ x + 2y = 5 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( y = 2x - 5 \\):\n\\[ x + 2(2x - 5) = 5 \\]\n\\[ x + 4x - 10 = 5 \\]\n\\[ 5x - 10 = 5 \\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\nWait, let me quickly verify each step:\n\n- Substituted \\( y \\) correctly: \u2714\ufe0f\n- Simplified correctly: \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything looks good so far.\n\n**Continuing:**\n\nNow, let\u2019s solve for \\( x \\).\n\n\\[ 5x - 10 = 5 \\]\n\n**Isolating \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[ 5x = 15 \\]\n\\[ x = 3 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, I\u2019ve got \\( x = 3 \\). Before moving on, let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nIf \\( x = 3 \\), then:\n\n\\[ y = 2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1 \\]\n\nSo, \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\). Let\u2019s see if these values satisfy both original equations.\n\n- **Check Equation 1:**  \n  \\( 2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **Check Equation 2:**  \n  \\( 3 + 2(1) = 3 + 2 = 5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so our solution seems correct.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThe substitution method worked well here. The calculations align with both equations, confirming that \\( x = 3 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Alternative Strategy (Elimination)***\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEven though substitution worked, let\u2019s briefly explore the elimination method to ensure consistency and deepen understanding.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIn elimination, we add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable. Let\u2019s see if eliminating \\( y \\) works here.\n\n**Setting Up:**\n\nOriginal Equations:\n\n1. \\( 2x - y = 5 \\)\n2. \\( x + 2y = 5 \\)\n\n**Multiply Equation 1 by 2:**\n\nThis will align the coefficients of \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ 4x - 2y = 10 \\] (Let's label this **Equation 3**)\n\n**Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:**\n\n\\[ (4x - 2y) - (x + 2y) = 10 - 5 \\]\n\\[ 4x - 2y - x - 2y = 5 \\]\n\\[ 3x - 4y = 5 \\] (But wait, this doesn\u2019t seem right; let\u2019s recheck.)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHold on. Instead of subtracting, let\u2019s try adding the equations after multiplying. Maybe I misstepped.\n\n**Adding Equation 1 multiplied by 2 to Equation 2:**\n\n\\[ (4x - 2y) + (x + 2y) = 10 + 5 \\]\n\\[ 5x = 15 \\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[ x = 3 \\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\nSo, using elimination, I also arrive at \\( x = 3 \\). This confirms that both methods yield the same result, ensuring the consistency of the solution.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nRevisiting both methods:\n\n- **Substitution Method:** Direct substitution led us to \\( x = 3 \\) smoothly.\n- **Elimination Method:** After adjusting the equations appropriately, we also reached \\( x = 3 \\).\n\nBoth approaches align, validating that \\( x = 3 \\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring and applying both the substitution and elimination methods, we've consistently found that \\( x = 3 \\). Starting with substitution, I double-checked each step to ensure accuracy. When briefly exploring elimination, I encountered a slight misstep but corrected it, leading to the same solution. Reflecting throughout the process helped catch any errors and confirm the validity of the result.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[ x = 3 \\]\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, checking my work regularly, and being open to adjusting approaches, I ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",
