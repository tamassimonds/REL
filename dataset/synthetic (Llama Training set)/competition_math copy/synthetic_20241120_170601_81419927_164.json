    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through it as I would naturally think, exploring different strategies, reflecting frequently, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d tackle understanding the range of the function \\( f(x) = ax + b \\) where \\( a < 0 \\) and \\( x \\) is restricted to the interval \\([0, 1]\\).\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about finding the **range** of the function \\( f(x) = ax + b \\) within the interval \\([0, 1]\\), given that \\( a < 0 \\). \n\n- **Range:** This refers to the set of all possible output values \\( f(x) \\) can take as \\( x \\) varies within \\([0, 1]\\).\n- **Linear Function:** Since \\( f(x) \\) is linear and \\( a < 0 \\), I recall that the function will be **decreasing** over the interval. That\u2019s an important property to leverage here.\n\nAt first glance, I feel like I might need to determine the minimum and maximum values of \\( f(x) \\) within this interval. But how exactly should I proceed? Let me brainstorm a bit.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Evaluate Endpoints:** Since it\u2019s a linear function, maybe checking the values at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\) could give me the range.\n   \n2. **Find Critical Points:** But, wait\u2014are there critical points in a linear function? I think only constant or linear functions have no turning points, so maybe this isn\u2019t necessary here.\n\n3. **Understanding the Effect of \\( a < 0 \\):** Given that \\( a \\) is negative, the slope is downward, which likely affects the maximum and minimum values.\n\n4. **Consider Transformations:** Maybe thinking about how the graph of \\( f(x) \\) shifts and reflects can help visualize the range.\n\nLet me start with the **Endpoints Evaluation** approach because it's straightforward and often works for linear functions. If that doesn't seem right, I'll explore other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluating the Function at Endpoints**\n\nLet's calculate \\( f(x) \\) at the endpoints of the interval \\( [0, 1] \\).\n\n- **At \\( x = 0 \\):**\n  \\[\n  f(0) = a(0) + b = b\n  \\]\n\n- **At \\( x = 1 \\):**\n  \\[\n  f(1) = a(1) + b = a + b\n  \\]\n\nNow, I have two values: \\( b \\) and \\( a + b \\).\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- Since \\( a < 0 \\), the term \\( a + b \\) is less than \\( b \\) (because \\( a \\) is negative). This makes sense for a decreasing function\u2014the maximum should occur at the right endpoint and the minimum at the left.\n\n- **Wait, but isn't that counterintuitive?** For decreasing functions, the maximum value should be at the left endpoint, not the right. Let me think this through.\n\nOh, I see the mistake! I assumed that \\( f(1) \\) is the maximum, but in a decreasing function, the maximum is actually at the left endpoint \\( x = 0 \\), which gives \\( f(0) = b \\). So, \\( b \\) is the maximum and \\( a + b \\) is the minimum.\n\nNice catch there! Let's continue.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Confirming the Minimum and Maximum Values**\n\nSo, the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( b \\) and the minimum value is \\( a + b \\). But how should I express the range in interval notation? \n\n- Since \\( a < 0 \\), \\( a + b < b \\). Therefore, the range is from \\( a + b \\) to \\( b \\).\n\n- **Interval Notation:** The range is \\([a + b, b]\\).\n\n**Double-Checking:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Given that \\( a < 0 \\), the function is decreasing, so as \\( x \\) moves from 0 to 1, \\( f(x) \\) decreases from \\( b \\) to \\( a + b \\). \n\n- **Quick Check:** For example, if \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\), then \\( f(0) = 2 \\) and \\( f(1) = 1 \\). The range would be \\([1, 2]\\), which aligns with our result.\n\n- **Reflection:** This seems correct. The range correctly reflects the behavior of a decreasing linear function over the interval \\([0, 1]\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with a Different Strategy**\n\nTo ensure that the approach is robust, let me try another method: **Considering the Graph of the Function.**\n\n- **Graph Insight:** Since \\( f(x) = ax + b \\) is a straight line with slope \\( a < 0 \\), the graph is a descending line. Over the interval \\([0, 1]\\), the line connects \\( f(0) = b \\) to \\( f(1) = a + b \\).\n\n- **Visualizing the Range:** The range is all values between \\( a + b \\) and \\( b \\), inclusive, as the line covers every value between these two endpoints.\n\n- **Comparison with Previous Result:** This graphical approach confirms that the range is indeed \\([a + b, b]\\).\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does this match our earlier calculation?** Yes, it does.\n\n- **Is there any inconsistency?** No, everything aligns.\n\n- **Does it feel right?** Absolutely, especially since both methods converge to the same range.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Expressing the Range in Interval Notation**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the results, the **range** of the function \\( f(x) = ax + b \\) for \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq 1 \\) and \\( a < 0 \\) is:\n\\[\n[a + b, b]\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Evaluating endpoints is a solid strategy for linear functions. Complementing it with a graphical perspective ensures accuracy.\n\n- **Importance of Reflection:** Regularly checking and reflecting on the work helps catch and correct mistakes early.\n\n- **Flexibility in Strategies:** Being open to trying different methods is crucial, especially when the initial approach seems off.\n\n- **Confidence in the Answer:** Multiple strategies leading to the same conclusion bolster confidence in the correctness of the range.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration helps in understanding how to determine the range of a linear function over a specified interval!",

  "ground_truth": "The function $f(x) = ax + b$ is linear, so as $x$ varies over the interval $0 \\le x \\le 1$, $f(x) = ax + b$ takes on all values between $b$ and $a + b$ (inclusive).  Furthermore, $a < 0$, so $a + b < b$.  Hence, the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{[a +b, b]}$."
