    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, mimicking a real human thought process. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking if I'm on the right track, and making adjustments as needed. Here we go.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem states that **\\(\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{b}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}\\|\\)**. Let me unpack this:\n\n- **\\(\\|\\mathbf{a}\\|\\)** and **\\(\\|\\mathbf{b}\\|\\)** are the magnitudes (or lengths) of vectors **\\(\\mathbf{a}\\)** and **\\(\\mathbf{b}\\)**, respectively.\n- The equality **\\(\\|\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}\\|\\)** means the magnitude of the sum of these vectors is also equal to their individual magnitudes.\n\nInitially, this feels a bit unusual because, in general, the magnitude of a sum of vectors is often greater than the magnitudes of the individual vectors unless certain conditions are met.\n\nNow, I recall that in vector addition, the angle between vectors plays a significant role in determining the magnitude of their sum. This reminds me of the **Cosine Law** in vectors, which relates the magnitudes of vectors and the angle between them.\n\nI'm not entirely sure yet if that's the right path, so let's explore it further.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Cosine Law for Vectors**: This law relates the square of the magnitude of the sum of two vectors to the squares of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them.\n\n2. **Express the Condition Algebraically**: Set up an equation based on the given condition and solve for the angle.\n\n3. **Check Special Cases**: Sometimes, analyzing specific angles (like 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, etc.) can provide insights or even lead directly to the solution.\n\n4. **Visual Approach**: Draw a diagram to visually assess the relationship between the vectors and their sum.\n\nLet's start with **Strategy 1: Use the Cosine Law for Vectors**, as it seems the most straightforward for relating magnitudes and angles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Cosine Law for Vectors**\n\nThe **Cosine Law** states:\n\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2 + \\|\\mathbf{b}\\|^2 + 2\\|\\mathbf{a}\\|\\|\\mathbf{b}\\|\\cos(\\theta)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- **\\(\\theta\\)** is the angle between **\\(\\mathbf{a}\\)** and **\\(\\mathbf{b}\\)**.\n\nGiven that **\\(\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{b}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}\\|\\)**, let's denote the common magnitude as **\\(M\\)**.\n\nSo, we have:\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{b}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}\\| = M\n\\]\n\nPlugging these into the Cosine Law equation:\n\n\\[\nM^2 = M^2 + M^2 + 2M \\cdot M \\cdot \\cos(\\theta)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nM^2 = 2M^2 + 2M^2 \\cos(\\theta)\n\\]\n\\[\nM^2 = 2M^2 (1 + \\cos(\\theta))\n\\]\n\nWait a second. This simplifies to:\n\\[\n1 = 2(1 + \\cos(\\theta))\n\\]\n\nHmm, let me double-check this. If I divide both sides by **\\(2\\)**:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} = 1 + \\cos(\\theta)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nOkay, so **\\(\\cos(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)**. This corresponds to an angle of **\\(120^\\circ\\)**.\n\nBut I'm not entirely convinced. Let me reflect for a moment. The calculation seems consistent, but it's always good to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Does \\(\\cos(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) make sense here?**\n\n  Yes, because an angle of **\\(120^\\circ\\)** between the vectors would result in the magnitudes aligning in such a way that the magnitude of their sum equals the magnitudes of the individual vectors.\n\n- **Is there another method to confirm this?**\n\n  Maybe I can use a **trigonometric identity** or check a special case to see if it aligns with this result.\n\nLet me try a different approach to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Checking with Special Cases**\n\nLet's consider specific cases to see if they align with our previous result.\n\n#### **Case 1: Angle of \\(120^\\circ\\)**\n\nIf the angle between **\\(\\mathbf{a}\\)** and **\\(\\mathbf{b}\\)** is **\\(120^\\circ\\)**:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging this back into the Cosine Law equation:\n\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2 + \\|\\mathbf{b}\\|^2 + 2\\|\\mathbf{a}\\|\\|\\mathbf{b}\\|(-\\frac{1}{2})\n\\]\n\\[\nM^2 = M^2 + M^2 - M^2\n\\]\n\\[\nM^2 = M^2\n\\]\n\nIt checks out! The magnitudes are consistent.\n\n#### **Case 2: Angle of \\(60^\\circ\\)**\n\nLet's see what happens if the angle is **\\(60^\\circ\\)**:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging into the Cosine Law:\n\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2 + \\|\\mathbf{b}\\|^2 + 2\\|\\mathbf{a}\\|\\|\\mathbf{b\\|}\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nM^2 = M^2 + M^2 + M^2\n\\]\n\\[\nM^2 = 3M^2\n\\]\n\nThis leads to **\\(M^2 = 3M^2\\)**, which simplifies to **\\(1 = 3\\)**. This is a contradiction.\n\nAh, this tells me that an angle of **\\(60^\\circ\\)** would not satisfy the given condition. It reinforces that our earlier finding of **\\(120^\\circ\\)** is indeed correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nThe calculation and the special case checks align perfectly. The angle that satisfies the condition **\\(\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{b}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}\\|\\)** is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120^\\circ}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Recap of the Thought Process**\n\n1. **Initial Brainstorming**: Started by recognizing the relationship between the magnitudes and the angle, recalling the Cosine Law for vectors.\n\n2. **Applying the Cosine Law**: Set up the equation based on the given condition, simplified it, and solved for **\\(\\cos(\\theta)\\)**.\n\n3. **Reflection and Verification**: Checked if the result made sense and considered alternate strategies to confirm.\n\n4. **Special Cases**: Tested specific angles to validate the solution, which confirmed that **\\(120^\\circ\\)** is correct.\n\n5. **Final Check**: Ensured all calculations were consistent and aligned with the problem's requirements.\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure to reflect, verify, and be open to adjusting my approach if something didn't seem right. This step-by-step method ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",
