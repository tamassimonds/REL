    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about triangular numbers. I'll try to brainstorm and explore different strategies, reflect on my approaches, check my work, and adjust as needed\u2014much like how I'd naturally tackle a problem.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the sequence **1, 3, 6, 10, ...**, I recall having encountered something similar before\u2014triangular numbers. But honestly, I can't remember all the details. Does anyone else feel like they've seen these in geometry? I vaguely recall that they relate to arranging dots in an equilateral triangle.\n\nAnyway, the question asks for the **20th triangular number**. At first glance, I'm not sure how to get there just by looking at the sequence. I suppose I could list them out, but that seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a formula involved?\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Recall a Formula:** I think there's a formula for finding the nth triangular number. Something with n and n+1...\n\n2. **List the Triangular Numbers:** I could try writing out the first 20 triangular numbers to see the pattern.\n\n3. **Geometric Approach:** Since these numbers are called triangular, maybe visualizing them geometrically could help.\n\n4. **Difference Between Terms:** Checking the differences between consecutive triangular numbers to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nHmm, the first strategy\u2014recalling a formula\u2014seems promising if I can remember it correctly. The second strategy\u2014listing them out\u2014feels a bit cumbersome but straightforward. The geometric approach might help me visualize, which could be useful.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Recall a Formula**\n\nLet me see... I think the formula for the nth triangular number is:\n\n\\[\nT_n = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nDoes that ring a bell? Wait, let me double-check. Yes, I remember now! It's the sum of the first n natural numbers.\n\nAlright, so if I want the **20th** triangular number, I would plug in \\( n = 20 \\) into the formula.\n\n\\[\nT_{20} = \\frac{20 \\times (20 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 21}{2} = \\frac{420}{2} = 210\n\\]\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\nLet me pause and check if this makes sense.\n\n- **Formula Review:** The formula \\( T_n = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\) seems correct because it calculates the sum of the first n integers, which aligns with the definition of triangular numbers.\n\n- **Calculation Check:** Multiplying 20 by 21 gives 420, and dividing by 2 results in 210. That seems reasonable.\n\n- **Intuition Check:** The number 210 feels like a plausible triangular number, especially since triangular numbers grow quite rapidly.\n\nEverything checks out, but just to be thorough, let's explore another strategy to ensure our answer is correct.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Listing the Triangular Numbers**\n\nMaybe listing the first few triangular numbers could confirm our formula's validity. Let's do that:\n\n1. **\\( T_1 = 1 \\):** 1 dot (simple triangle)\n\n2. **\\( T_2 = 3 \\):** 1 + 2 dots\n\n   ```\n     *\n    * *\n   ```\n\n3. **\\( T_3 = 6 \\):** 1 + 2 + 3 dots\n\n   ```\n       *\n      * *\n     * * *\n   ```\n\n4. **\\( T_4 = 10 \\):** 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 dots\n\n   ```\n        *\n       * *\n      * * *\n     * * * *\n   ```\n\n5. **Continuing this way up to \\( T_{20} \\):**\n\n   Honestly, listing all the way up to 20 would take a lot of time and space, but I can see the pattern building up.\n\n### **Reflection on Strategy 2**\n\nListing out the triangular numbers confirms the growth pattern, but it's not the most efficient way to find the 20th number. It's more of a validation step rather than a practical solution.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Geometric Approach**\n\nSince these numbers are called triangular, perhaps visualizing them with dots in a triangular formation could provide insight. But I'm not sure how this would directly help in calculating the 20th number.\n\nWait, maybe it would help reinforce that the formula makes sense because each triangular number represents the total dots needed to form an equilateral triangle with n rows.\n\n**Reflection:** This approach isn't necessarily helping us compute the 20th number directly, so I'll set it aside for now.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 4: Difference Between Terms**\n\nLet's look at the differences between consecutive triangular numbers to see if there's a pattern:\n\n- \\( T_2 - T_1 = 3 - 1 = 2 \\)\n- \\( T_3 - T_2 = 6 - 3 = 3 \\)\n- \\( T_4 - T_3 = 10 - 6 = 4 \\)\n- \\( T_5 - T_4 = 15 - 10 = 5 \\)\n\nPattern: The difference between consecutive triangular numbers is increasing by 1 each time.\n\nThis makes sense because each triangular number adds an additional row of dots, increasing the total by the row number (which increments by 1).\n\n**Reflection:** While this observation is interesting, it doesn't directly help in calculating the 20th triangular number without the formula.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, recalling the formula for triangular numbers \\( T_n = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\) seems the most efficient and straightforward approach. Listing them out and looking at geometric representations are helpful for understanding but not practical for calculating large indices like 20.\n\n### **Calculating the 20th Triangular Number Again**\n\nLet's perform the calculation one more time to ensure accuracy:\n\n\\[\nT_{20} = \\frac{20 \\times (20 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 21}{2} = \\frac{420}{2} = 210\n\\]\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Formula Validity:** The formula is correct for calculating triangular numbers.\n\n- **Calculation Accuracy:** The arithmetic checks out\u2014420 divided by 2 is indeed 210.\n\n- **Answer Plausibility:** 210 is a reasonable triangular number, aligning with the growth pattern observed in earlier terms.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their applicability, and verifying calculations, the **20th triangular number is indeed **210**.\n\nHope this step-by-step exploration helps in understanding how to approach such problems!",
