    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. When I first see it, **Finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of \\(5!\\) and \\(6!\\)**, a few thoughts pop into my mind:\n\n- **Familiarity with Factorials:** I remember that factorials involve multiplying a series of descending natural numbers. So, \\( n! = n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times \\ldots \\times 2 \\times 1 \\).\n  \n- **Properties of Factorials:** It looks like \\(6!\\) includes \\(5!\\) as part of its computation. Maybe that relationship can help simplify things.\n\n- **GCF Understanding:** The greatest common factor is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. Since \\(6!\\) contains \\(5!\\), perhaps the GCF is directly related to \\(5!\\).\n\nBut I also realize I should explore different strategies to be sure. Let's brainstorm a bit.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Expand Factorials:** Compute \\(5!\\) and \\(6!\\) explicitly and then find their GCF.\n   \n2. **Use Prime Factorization:** Factor both \\(5!\\) and \\(6!\\) into their prime components to see common factors.\n\n3. **Leverage the Relationship Between \\(5!\\) and \\(6!\\):** Since \\(6! = 6 \\times 5!\\), maybe that can simplify the process.\n\n4. **Euclidean Algorithm:** Though typically used for numbers, maybe a factorial version exists.\n\nHonestly, the third option seems promising because \\(6!\\) is built upon \\(5!\\). But I'll still consider expanding factorials to confirm. Let's start with that and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Expanding Factorials**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's compute \\(5!\\) and \\(6!\\) explicitly. This should give me exact numbers to work with, making it easier to visualize their common factors.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Compute \\(5!\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n  \\]\n\n- **Compute \\(6!\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  6! = 6 \\times 5! = 6 \\times 120 = 720\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nAlright, so we have \\(5! = 120\\) and \\(6! = 720\\). At first glance, it looks like 120 might be a factor of 720, but let's check to be sure by finding the GCF.\n\n**Response:**\nHmm, I should confirm if 120 divides 720 exactly.\n\n\\[\n720 \\div 120 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nYes, 120 goes into 720 exactly 6 times. This aligns with my initial thought that \\(5!\\) is a part of \\(6!\\). But before jumping to conclusions, let's try another method to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Exploring Prime Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nMaybe breaking down \\(5!\\) and \\(6!\\) into their prime factors will reveal common divisors more clearly. This might help validate our previous finding.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Prime Factorization of \\(5!\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5 \\times (2^2) \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\n  \\]\n  \n  Simplifying:\n  \n  \\[\n  = 5 \\times 2^3 \\times 3\n  \\]\n  \n  So, \\(5! = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5\\).\n\n- **Prime Factorization of \\(6!\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  6! = 6 \\times 5! = 6 \\times (2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5) = (2 \\times 3) \\times (2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5)\n  \\]\n  \n  Simplifying:\n  \n  \\[\n  = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n  \\]\n  \n  So, \\(6! = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nLooking at the prime factorization:\n\n- \\(5!\\) has \\(2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)\n- \\(6!\\) has \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\)\n\n**Response:**\nWait a minute! The only difference is in the powers of 2 and 3. The \\(5\\) is common in both. So, the GCF must be the product of the lowest powers of the common prime factors.\n\n**Check:**\nLet's list the common prime factors:\n\n- **2:** Minimum power is \\(2^3\\)\n- **3:** Minimum power is \\(3^1\\)\n- **5:** Power is \\(5^1\\)\n\nSo, the GCF should be:\n\n\\[\n2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 8 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 120\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis matches our earlier finding. But to be extra sure, let's consider one more method.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Leveraging the Relationship Between \\(5!\\) and \\(6!\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince \\(6! = 6 \\times 5!\\), perhaps the GCF is simply \\(5!\\). This seems intuitive because \\(5!\\) is a factor of \\(6!\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **GCF Calculation:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{GCF}(5!, 6!) = 5!\n  \\]\n  \n  Based on our earlier computation, \\(5! = 120\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis straightforward approach confirms our findings from the previous methods. It makes sense because \\(5!\\) is included in \\(6!\\), so naturally, \\(5!\\) is the greatest factor common to both.\n\n**Response:**\nOh! This reminds me that when one factorial is a multiple of another, the GCF is the smaller factorial. In this case, \\(6! = 6 \\times 5!\\), so the GCF must be \\(5!\\), which we've already determined is 120.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Check: Comparing Different Approaches**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's ensure all strategies lead to the same conclusion. Consistency across multiple methods adds confidence in the correctness of the answer.\n\n**Check:**\n\n1. **Expanding Factorials:**\n   - GCF of 120 and 720 is 120.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Common factors yield GCF of 120.\n\n3. **Leveraging Factorial Relationship:**\n   - Directly, \\( \\text{GCF}(5!, 6!) = 5! = 120\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nAll approaches converge to the same GCF: 120. This consistency reassures me that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring various strategies\u2014expanding factorials, prime factorization, and leveraging the relationship between \\(5!\\) and \\(6!\\)\u2014we consistently arrive at the greatest common factor:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step exploration, along with checking and reflecting at each stage, confirms the accuracy of the solution.",
