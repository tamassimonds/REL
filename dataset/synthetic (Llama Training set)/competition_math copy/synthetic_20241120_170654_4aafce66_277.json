    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process step by step, exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and reflecting on whether each approach is correct. I'll brainstorm various methods, see what works, and adjust as needed\u2014just like a human would naturally tackle a problem.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the question is asking for the smallest positive integer \\( x \\) that is greater than 1 and relatively prime to 120. Relatively prime means that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( x \\) and 120 is 1. \n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **\"This reminds me of problems where I have to avoid certain factors.\"** I recall dealing with GCD and prime factors in similar questions.\n- **\"Maybe listing out numbers could work, but that seems tedious.\"** I'm thinking of starting with small integers greater than 1 and checking their GCD with 120.\n- **\"Or perhaps there's a more systematic approach using prime factorization?\"** Prime factorization might help identify which numbers are relatively prime more efficiently.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Listing and Checking:**\n   - Start from \\( x = 2 \\) and go up, checking each number's GCD with 120.\n   \n2. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Factorize 120 to understand which primes shouldn't be in \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Euler's Totient Function (\\( \\phi(n) \\)):**\n   - Use this to find numbers less than 120 that are coprime to 120, then pick the smallest \\( x > 1 \\).\n\n4. **Graphical Method or Sieve Approach:**\n   - Visualize multiples of the prime factors of 120 to eliminate non-relatively prime numbers.\n\n**Reflection on Strategies:**\n- **\"Listing and checking seems straightforward but could take time.\"** It might be cumbersome, especially if 120 has many factors.\n- **\"Prime factorization is a solid approach; maybe start there.\"** Understanding the prime components of 120 could help eliminate candidates quickly.\n- **\"Euler's Totient Function sounds advanced for just finding the smallest \\( x \\).\"** Perhaps overkill for this problem but good to keep in mind for larger-scale queries.\n- **\"Graphical methods or sieves might complicate things.\"** Not necessary for such a small number.\n\n**Decision:** I'll start with **Prime Factorization** to get a better handle on 120 and see if that leads me directly to the solution. If it feels too complicated, I'll switch to **Listing and Checking** as a backup.\n\n### **Step 1: Factorize 120**\n\nLet\u2019s begin by breaking down 120 into its prime factors.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **\"Prime factorization will help identify which primes are part of 120.\"** Any number \\( x \\) that shares these primes (other than 1) with 120 won't be relatively prime.\n- **\"Maybe I can spot patterns or shortcuts once I know the factors.\"**\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Start by dividing 120 by the smallest prime, which is 2:\n  \\[\n  120 \\div 2 = 60\n  \\]\n- Continue dividing by 2:\n  \\[\n  60 \\div 2 = 30\n  \\]\n- Again by 2:\n  \\[\n  30 \\div 2 = 15\n  \\]\n- Now, 15 is not divisible by 2, so move to the next prime, which is 3:\n  \\[\n  15 \\div 3 = 5\n  \\]\n- Finally, 5 is a prime number.\n\n**Prime Factorization of 120:**\n\\[\n120 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **\"Got it! 120 is made up of the primes 2, 3, and 5.\"** This means any \\( x \\) must not be divisible by these primes to be relatively prime to 120.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Candidates Greater Than 1**\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the smallest integers greater than 1 that are not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **\"I need to find the smallest number above 1 that avoids all the prime factors of 120.\"** Essentially, this number should not have 2, 3, or 5 in its prime factorization.\n- **\"Maybe I can start checking from 2 upwards, but I should skip multiples of 2, 3, and 5.\"**\n\n**Listing Candidates:**\n- \\( x = 2 \\): Divisible by 2 \u2192 **Not Relatively Prime**\n- \\( x = 3 \\): Divisible by 3 \u2192 **Not Relatively Prime**\n- \\( x = 4 \\): \\( 4 = 2^2 \\) \u2192 **Not Relatively Prime**\n- \\( x = 5 \\): Divisible by 5 \u2192 **Not Relatively Prime**\n- \\( x = 6 \\): Divisible by 2 and 3 \u2192 **Not Relatively Prime**\n- \\( x = 7 \\): **Uncertain, need to check GCD with 120.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **\"Looking through this list, it seems like many small numbers are ruled out because they share factors with 120.\"** This reinforces the idea that 2, 3, and 5 are significant factors.\n- **\"Perhaps focusing on prime numbers greater than 5 might be a good strategy.\"** Since primes have only themselves and 1 as factors, they could be candidates if they\u2019re not 2, 3, or 5.\n\n### **Step 3: Checking \\( x = 7 \\) for Relatively Prime Status**\n\nLet\u2019s test \\( x = 7 \\) to see if it\u2019s relatively prime to 120.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **\"7 is a prime number and doesn\u2019t fall into the multiples of 2, 3, or 5.\"** So, it might be a good candidate.\n- **\"But I need to confirm by checking the GCD with 120.\"**\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Find \\( \\text{GCD}(7, 120) \\).\n- Since 7 is prime and not a factor of 120, the only divisors are 1 and 7.\n- \\( 120 \\) divided by 7 is approximately \\( 17.14 \\), so 7 doesn\u2019t evenly divide 120.\n\n**GCD Verification:**\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(7, 120) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **\"Great! \\( x = 7 \\) is indeed relatively prime to 120.\"** This fits the criteria perfectly.\n- **\"Let me double-check to ensure there's no smaller number that is also relatively prime.\"** I\u2019ll briefly consider numbers between 2 and 7.\n\n### **Step 4: Quick Check for Smaller Candidates (2 to 6)**\n\nEven though I already ruled out numbers from 2 to 6, let\u2019s quickly verify to be sure.\n\n- \\( x = 2 \\): Divisible by 2 \u2192 **Not Relatively Prime**\n- \\( x = 3 \\): Divisible by 3 \u2192 **Not Relatively Prime**\n- \\( x = 4 \\): Divisible by 2 \u2192 **Not Relatively Prime**\n- \\( x = 5 \\): Divisible by 5 \u2192 **Not Relatively Prime**\n- \\( x = 6 \\): Divisible by 2 and 3 \u2192 **Not Relatively Prime**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **\"Confirming that all numbers from 2 to 6 share factors with 120.\"** This reinforces that 7 is indeed the smallest qualifying integer.\n- **\"Also, since 7 is a prime number and greater than 1, it fits all the criteria.\"** No need to look further.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s ensure everything aligns with the problem\u2019s requirements.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **\"The requirement is to find the smallest integer greater than 1 that is relatively prime to 120.\"** \n- **\"I've identified \\( x = 7 \\) as the smallest number that meets these criteria.\"** \n- **\"Let me re-confirm the GCD and check if no smaller number qualifies.\"**\n\n**GCD Check:**\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(7, 120) = 1\n\\]\n\u2192 **\"Confirmed that 7 and 120 are relatively prime.\"**\n\n**Smallest Candidate Verification:**\n- **\"No integers between 2 and 6 are relatively prime to 120.\"**\n- **\"Thus, 7 is indeed the smallest integer greater than 1 that is relatively prime to 120.\"**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **\"Everything checks out!\"** The approach is correct, and the solution is valid.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014starting with prime factorization, briefly considering listing and checking, and confirming through GCD calculations\u2014I\u2019ve determined that the smallest positive integer \\( x \\) greater than 1 and relatively prime to 120 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- **\"Initially, I considered multiple methods, and even though listing seemed straightforward, prime factorization provided a clearer path.\"** \n- **\"Checking GCD confirmed the solution, and verifying smaller candidates ensured completeness.\"** \n- **\"Reflecting and double-checking along the way helped catch any potential oversights.\"** \n- **\"This approach not only solved the problem efficiently but also provided confidence in the correctness of the solution.\"**\n\nBy thinking through each step, continuously reflecting, and adjusting strategies as needed, I've arrived at the correct and verified solution.",
