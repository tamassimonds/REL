    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it step by step, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each approach, and checking along the way to ensure everything makes sense. It\u2019s important to think through each part, just like how I would naturally tackle a problem on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Equations Given:**  \n  \\[\n  3x + y = a\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  2x + 5y = 2a\n  \\]\n\n- **Condition:**  \n  The system has a solution \\((x, y)\\) when \\(x = 2\\), and I need to compute \\(a\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Substitution Method:** Maybe I can substitute \\(x = 2\\) into both equations to find \\(y\\) and then determine \\(a\\).\n  \n- **Elimination Method:** Perhaps by eliminating \\(y\\) or \\(x\\) between the two equations, I could find a relationship that leads to \\(a\\).\n  \n- **Matrix Approach:** Using matrices to represent the system and apply row operations might work, but it feels a bit overcomplicated for just two equations.\n\n- **Reflecting:** Substitution seems straightforward since we know \\(x = 2\\). Let\u2019s start there and see where it leads.\n\n**Decision:** Let\u2019s try the **Substitution Method** first. If it gets messy or doesn\u2019t lead to a clear solution, we can reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Substituting \\(x = 2\\) into the First Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since \\(x = 2\\) is part of the solution, substituting it into the first equation should help me find \\(y\\) in terms of \\(a\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n3(2) + y = a\n\\]  \n\\[\n6 + y = a\n\\]  \n\\[\ny = a - 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This gives me \\(y\\) in terms of \\(a\\). So far, so good. It seems like a reasonable step.\n\n- **Check:** Let me quickly verify if substituting back makes sense.  \n  If \\(a = a\\), and \\(6 + (a - 6) = a\\), it holds true. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting \\(y = a - 6\\) into the Second Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have \\(y\\) in terms of \\(a\\), I can substitute this into the second equation to express everything in terms of \\(a\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n2(2) + 5(a - 6) = 2a\n\\]  \n\\[\n4 + 5a - 30 = 2a\n\\]  \n\\[\n5a - 26 = 2a\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Substituting \\(y\\) seemed to work. Now, I have an equation solely in terms of \\(a\\).\n\n- **Check:** Let\u2019s quickly see if simplifying makes sense.  \n  \\(5a - 26 = 2a\\) can be simplified. No errors so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\(a\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find \\(a\\), I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. This will give me the value of \\(a\\) that satisfies both equations simultaneously for \\(x = 2\\) and the corresponding \\(y\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n5a - 26 = 2a\n\\]  \n\\[\n5a - 2a = 26\n\\]  \n\\[\n3a = 26\n\\]  \n\\[\na = \\frac{26}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- So, \\(a = \\frac{26}{3}\\). This feels like a valid solution.\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - Multiply back:  \n    \\(3a = 26 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{26}{3}\\)  \n    - Double-check: \\(5(\\frac{26}{3}) - 2(\\frac{26}{3}) = \\frac{130}{3} - \\frac{52}{3} = \\frac{78}{3} = 26\\)  \n      - Wait, does \\(26 = 26\\)? Yes, it does.\n\n- The checks align, confirming that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution with Both Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- It\u2019s always good practice to plug the solution back into both original equations to ensure they hold true. This verifies the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **First Equation:**  \n   \\[\n   3(2) + (a - 6) = a\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   6 + \\left(\\frac{26}{3} - 6\\right) = \\frac{26}{3}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   6 - 6 + \\frac{26}{3} = \\frac{26}{3}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   0 + \\frac{26}{3} = \\frac{26}{3}\n   \\]  \n   - **Result:** True\n\n2. **Second Equation:**  \n   \\[\n   2(2) + 5(a - 6) = 2a\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   4 + 5\\left(\\frac{26}{3} - 6\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{26}{3}\\right)\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   4 + 5\\left(\\frac{26}{3} - \\frac{18}{3}\\right) = \\frac{52}{3}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   4 + 5\\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right) = \\frac{52}{3}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   4 + \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{52}{3}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{12}{3} + \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{52}{3}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{52}{3} = \\frac{52}{3}\n   \\]  \n   - **Result:** True\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Both equations are satisfied with \\(a = \\frac{26}{3}\\), confirming that the solution is correct.\n\n- **Insight:** Verifying solutions is crucial to avoid errors, especially in systems of equations where multiple variables interact.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Starting with substitution worked well here because we had a specific value for \\(x\\). It led directly to finding \\(y\\) and then \\(a\\) without unnecessary complications.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** The elimination method could have been used, but it would likely involve more steps and complexity without leveraging the given \\(x = 2\\) directly.\n\n- **Importance of Checks:** Always plugging the solution back into the original equations ensures that no mistakes were made during the process.\n\n- **Reflection:** Initially considering multiple methods helped identify the most straightforward path, making the solution process efficient and effective.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{26}{3}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, filled with brainstorming, reflections, and checks, led us to confidently determine that \\(a = \\frac{26}{3}\\) is the correct solution.",
