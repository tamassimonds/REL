    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle this problem step-by-step, thinking through various strategies, reflecting on their correctness, and adjusting our approach as needed. I'll mimic natural human thought processes, including brainstorming, checking work, and making adjustments when things don't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, **\\[4 \\bowtie y = 10\\]**, I think, \"This looks like an equation involving nested square roots.\" The operation **\\(\\bowtie\\)** is defined as:\n\n\\[\na \\bowtie b = a + \\sqrt{b + \\sqrt{b + \\sqrt{b + \\ldots}}}\n\\]\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of expressions that involve fixed points or solving for variables inside infinite radicals. Infinite square roots tend to converge to a specific value, so maybe I should explore that.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure how to handle the **\\(\\bowtie\\)** operator directly. It feels a bit unfamiliar, like a puzzle piece that hasn't fully clicked into place yet. Would separating the equation help, or should I consider squaring both sides to eliminate the square root?\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Understanding the Operator**: Maybe diving deeper into what **\\(\\bowtie\\)** means could help. If I can express it differently, the equation might become easier to solve.\n\n2. **Squaring Both Sides**: To deal with the square root, squaring both sides might eliminate it, but I need to be careful about extraneous solutions.\n\n3. **Fixed Point Approach**: Recognizing that the nested square root converges to a fixed point could lead me to set up an equation where the inside equals the outside.\n\n4. **Graphical Interpretation**: Perhaps plotting both sides of the equation could give insights, but this seems more visual than algebraic.\n\nI'm leaning towards the **Fixed Point Approach** because it aligns with how infinite radicals typically resolve. But let's explore another method to see if it leads us down the right path.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Fixed Point Approach**\n\nI recall that for an expression like **\\(\\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\ldots}}\\)**, if it converges, then the whole expression equals **\\(x\\)**. Applying this concept, I can set up the following:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\ldots}}} = y\n\\]\n\nBut wait\u2014this seems to redefine **\\(y\\)** itself, which might complicate things. Perhaps I should redefine the entire **\\(\\bowtie\\)** operation instead. Let\u2019s try that.\n\n---\n\n### **Defining \\(\\bowtie\\) More Clearly**\n\nI realize that the infinite radical component must converge to a specific value. Let me set up the equation based on the definition:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\ldots}}} = x\n\\]\n\nSuppose this converges to **\\(x\\)**. Then, squaring both sides:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = y + \\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\ldots}} = y + x\n\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - x - y = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, **\\(x\\)** (the value of the infinite radical) satisfies this quadratic equation in terms of **\\(y\\)**. This feels promising because it relates **\\(x\\)** directly to **\\(y\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Setting Up the Original Equation**\n\nReturning to the original problem:\n\n\\[\n4 \\bowtie y = 10\n\\]\n\nFrom our definition:\n\n\\[\n4 + \\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\ldots}}} = 10\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\ldots}}} = 6\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s denote the infinite radical as **\\(x\\)**, so:\n\n\\[\nx = 6\n\\]\n\nBut earlier, I set up the relationship **\\(x^2 - x - y = 0\\)**. Substituting **\\(x = 6\\)** into this equation:\n\n\\[\n6^2 - 6 - y = 0\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n36 - 6 - y = 0 \\implies 30 - y = 0 \\implies y = 30\n\\]\n\nAh, this is a clear path. But let me check if this makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's backtrack and see if this value satisfies the original equation. \n\nAccording to our setup:\n\n\\[\n4 \\bowtie 30 = 4 + \\sqrt{30 + \\sqrt{30 + \\sqrt{30 + \\ldots}}}\n\\]\n\nWe defined:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{30 + \\sqrt{30 + \\sqrt{30 + \\ldots}}} = 6\n\\]\n\nDoes this hold true?\n\nRecalling the earlier definition:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = y + x \\implies 6^2 = 30 + 6 \\implies 36 = 36\n\\]\n\nPerfect! Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Another Approach for Confirmation**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's consider an alternative method\u2014**squaring both sides** of the original equation after isolating the square root.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\ldots}}} = 6\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n\\[\nz = \\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\sqrt{y + \\ldots}}}\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\nz = 6\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\nz^2 = y + z\n\\]\n\nSubstituting **\\(z = 6\\)**:\n\n\\[\n6^2 = y + 6 \\implies 36 = y + 6 \\implies y = 30\n\\]\n\nThis alternative approach also leads us to **\\(y = 30\\)**. It's comforting to arrive at the same solution through different methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies\u2014defining the \\(\\bowtie\\) operation clearly, setting up equations based on fixed points, and verifying through squaring both sides\u2014I've consistently arrived at **\\(y = 30\\)**.\n\nThroughout the process, I:\n\n1. **Brainstormed** different methods to handle the nested radical.\n2. **Checked** each step to ensure correctness, especially after substituting values.\n3. **Reflected** on whether the approaches made sense, adjusting when an initial idea felt off.\n4. **Confirmed** the solution by verifying it satisfies the original equation.\n\nGiven that all paths lead to the same outcome, I confidently conclude that:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]\n\nThis detailed, reflective approach ensures that the solution is both accurate and well-understood, resembling a human problem-solving process with all its nuances.",

  "ground_truth": "We know that $$4\\bowtie y = 4+\\sqrt{y+\\sqrt{y+\\sqrt{y+...}}}=10.$$Therefore, $\\sqrt{y+\\sqrt{y+\\sqrt{y+...}}}=6$. Because the series of $\\sqrt{y+\\sqrt{y+\\sqrt{y+...}}}$ is infinite, we can substitute $6$ into the series for any $\\sqrt{y+\\sqrt{y+\\sqrt{y+...}}}$ we want. Thus, $$\\sqrt{y+\\sqrt{y+\\sqrt{y+...}}}=6$$implies that $$\\sqrt{y+\\sqrt{y+\\sqrt{y+...}}}=\\sqrt{y+6}=6.$$Squaring both sides of this new equality, we have $y+6=36$, or $y=\\boxed{30}$."
