    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through different strategies, checking along the way, and adjusting our approach as needed. I'll try to emulate human-like problem-solving, complete with brainstorming, reflections, and corrections.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I first see this question, it reminds me of triangles involving right angles and perhaps the Pythagorean theorem. Triangle \\( ABC \\) has sides \\( AB = 10 \\) and \\( AC = 17 \\), with \\( D \\) being the foot of the perpendicular from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\). The ratio \\( BD : CD = 2 : 5 \\). We're asked to find \\( AD \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Right Triangle Concepts:** Since \\( AD \\) is the altitude, maybe the Pythagorean theorem could be useful.\n- **Coordinate Geometry:** Assigning coordinates to the points might simplify finding lengths and relationships.\n- **Trigonometric Ratios:** Angles could play a role, but without more information, they might not be necessary.\n- **Mass Points or Section Formula:** Given the ratio \\( BD : CD \\), mass points or section formula might help in finding coordinates or relationships between segments.\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\nBut comparing \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\) directly might lead to complications if I start with coordinates right away. Maybe there's a better approach leveraging the given ratios more directly.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Strategy - Using Ratios and Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's assign coordinates to the points:\n- Let \\( B \\) be at the origin \\( (0, 0) \\).\n- \\( C \\) along the x-axis at \\( (BC, 0) \\).\n- \\( A \\) at \\( (x, y) \\) such that \\( AB = 10 \\) and \\( AC = 17 \\).\n- \\( D \\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\), so \\( D \\) is vertically below \\( A \\) on line \\( BC \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. Since \\( D \\) lies on \\( BC \\), its coordinates are \\( (d, 0) \\).\n2. The ratio \\( BD : CD = 2 : 5 \\) implies:\n   \\[\n   BD = \\frac{2}{2 + 5} \\times BC = \\frac{2}{7} \\times BC\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   CD = \\frac{5}{2 + 5} \\times BC = \\frac{5}{7} \\times BC\n   \\]\n3. Therefore, \\( d = BD = \\frac{2}{7} \\times BC = \\frac{2}{7} \\times d \\) (which seems off\u2014let's rectify this).\n\n**Reflection:**\nHold on! I assigned \\( d \\) as both the x-coordinate of \\( C \\) and \\( BD \\). That's confusing. Let's clarify:\n\n- Let \\( BC = x \\).\n- \\( BD = \\frac{2}{7} x \\).\n- \\( CD = \\frac{5}{7} x \\).\n- Hence, \\( d = BD = \\frac{2}{7} x \\).\n\n**Realization:**\nThis might get messy because we have two variables \\( x \\) (length of \\( BC \\)) and the coordinates of \\( A \\). It seems like overcomplicating things. Maybe there's a better way to utilize the ratios without diving deep into coordinate geometry right now.\n\n### **Step 3: Alternative Strategy - Using Similar Triangles or Ratios Directly**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nGiven the ratio \\( BD : CD = 2 : 5 \\), perhaps leveraging similar triangles or ratios related to right triangles could simplify the problem without assigning coordinates.\n\n**Plan:**\n- Use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides and the altitude \\( AD \\).\n- Express \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\) in terms of \\( BC \\) and use the given ratio to find relationships between \\( BC \\), \\( BD \\), and \\( CD \\).\n- Find \\( AD \\) using these relationships.\n\n**Potential Steps:**\n1. Relate \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\) to \\( BC \\).\n2. Use the Pythagorean theorem to relate \\( AB \\), \\( AC \\), and \\( AD \\).\n3. Solve for \\( AD \\).\n\n**Wait, Maybe...**\nBut I still need \\( BC \\), which isn't directly given. Perhaps I can find \\( BC \\) using the ratio and the given side lengths.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating \\( BC \\) Using the Given Ratio**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe ratio \\( BD : CD = 2 : 5 \\) suggests that \\( D \\) divides \\( BC \\) in this proportion. Let's express \\( BC \\) in terms of \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. Let \\( BD = 2k \\) and \\( CD = 5k \\) for some \\( k \\).\n2. Therefore, \\( BC = BD + CD = 2k + 5k = 7k \\).\n3. From the ratio, \\( \\frac{BD}{CD} = \\frac{2k}{5k} = \\frac{2}{5} \\), which matches the given ratio.\n\n**Realization:**\nNow, I have expressed \\( BC \\) in terms of \\( k \\) and the lengths of \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\) in terms of \\( k \\).\n\n### **Step 5: Applying Pythagorean Theorem to Find \\( AD \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nUse the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \\( ABD \\) to relate \\( AB \\), \\( AD \\), and \\( BD \\). However, I need \\( BD \\) and \\( BC \\), so I may need to relate \\( AD \\) to \\( BD \\) and \\( AB \\) first.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. In triangle \\( ABD \\):\n   \\[\n   AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10^2 = AD^2 + (2k)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   100 = AD^2 + 4k^2 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. In triangle \\( ACD \\):\n   \\[\n   AC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   17^2 = AD^2 + (5k)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   289 = AD^2 + 25k^2 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n   \\[\n   289 - 100 = (AD^2 + 25k^2) - (AD^2 + 4k^2)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   189 = 21k^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k^2 = \\frac{189}{21} = 9\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k = 3\n   \\]\n   \n4. Now, substitute \\( k = 3 \\) back into the expressions for \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\):\n   \\[\n   BD = 2k = 2 \\times 3 = 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   CD = 5k = 5 \\times 3 = 15\n   \\]\n   \n5. Calculate \\( BC \\):\n   \\[\n   BC = BD + CD = 6 + 15 = 21\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Earlier, I assigned \\( BD = \\frac{2}{7} \\times BC \\), but now \\( BD = 6 \\) and \\( BC = 21 \\), which would mean \\( \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7} \\). So this aligns with the given ratio, which is good.\n\n### **Step 6: Finding \\( AD \\) Using the Value of \\( k \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have \\( k = 3 \\), I can substitute back into Equation 1 to find \\( AD \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. From Equation 1:\n   \\[\n   100 = AD^2 + 4k^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   100 = AD^2 + 4 \\times 9\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   100 = AD^2 + 36\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   AD^2 = 100 - 36 = 64\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   AD = \\sqrt{64} = 8\n   \\]\n   \n**Check:**\nThis makes sense because if \\( AD = 8 \\), then in triangle \\( ABD \\):\n   \\[\n   10^2 = 8^2 + 6^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   100 = 64 + 36 = 100\n   \\]\nThis satisfies the Pythagorean theorem, so the calculation is correct.\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n**Did This Work?**\nYes, by using the given ratio to express \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\) in terms of a common variable \\( k \\), and applying the Pythagorean theorem in triangles \\( ABD \\) and \\( ACD \\), I was able to solve for \\( k \\) and subsequently find \\( AD = 8 \\).\n\n**Alternative Approaches Considered:**\n- **Using Trigonometric Ratios:** Could have explored angles, but without more information, they weren't necessary.\n- **Coordinate Geometry:** Initially considered, but ended up being more complicated than needed.\n- **Similar Triangles:** Might have been applicable, but the given ratio directly led to a straightforward path using Pythagorean theorems.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   AD = 8\n   \\]\n\nBy reflecting and checking each step, ensuring consistency with the given ratios, and validating with the Pythagorean theorem, the solution feels robust and correct.",
