I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n**Given:** The polynomial \\( x^2 - 5x + t \\) has only positive integer roots.\n\n**Goal:** Find the average of all distinct possible values of \\( t \\).\n\nHmm, at first glance, this reminds me of polynomials I've dealt with before, especially those involving Vieta's formulas. I **think** I need to relate the roots to the coefficients somehow. But let me brainstorm a bit more to see what other strategies might work.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Vieta's Formulas:** I recall that for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the sum and product of the roots are related to the coefficients. This seems like a natural starting point.\n\n2. **Factoring the Polynomial:** Another approach could be to factor the polynomial and set each factor equal to the possible integer roots. This might give me a direct way to find \\( t \\).\n\n3. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** I could use the quadratic formula to find the roots and then set conditions for \\( t \\). But this seems a bit more complicated than necessary.\n\n4. **Diophantine Equations:** Since we're dealing with integer roots, maybe thinking in terms of Diophantine equations could help.\n\n**Reflection:** Vieta's formulas sound like the most straightforward method because they directly link the roots to the coefficients. Factoring might also work, but let's see how Vieta's applies first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Vieta's Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nVieta's formulas tell me that for the quadratic \\( x^2 - 5x + t \\):\n- The **sum of the roots** \\( r_1 + r_2 = 5 \\)\n- The **product of the roots** \\( r_1 \\times r_2 = t \\)\n\nGiven that the roots are positive integers, I can use these equations to find possible pairs \\( (r_1, r_2) \\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \nLet's list out possible pairs of positive integers that sum to 5:\n- \\( (1, 4) \\)\n- \\( (2, 3) \\)\n- \\( (3, 2) \\)\n- \\( (4, 1) \\)\n\nWait a second\u2014since multiplication is commutative, \\( (2, 3) \\) is the same as \\( (3, 2) \\). So, we actually have only **three distinct pairs**:\n1. \\( (1, 4) \\)\n2. \\( (2, 3) \\)\n3. \\( (4, 1) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, now I have three distinct pairs of roots. Each pair will give me a different value of \\( t \\). It seems like I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating \\( t \\) for Each Pair**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince the product of the roots \\( r_1 \\times r_2 = t \\), I'll calculate \\( t \\) for each distinct pair.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **For \\( (1, 4) \\):**\n   \\[\n   t = 1 \\times 4 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **For \\( (2, 3) \\):**\n   \\[\n   t = 2 \\times 3 = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **For \\( (4, 1) \\):**\n   \\[\n   t = 4 \\times 1 = 4\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, I notice that \\( t = 4 \\) appears twice. This means that \\( t = 4 \\) corresponds to both \\( (1, 4) \\) and \\( (4, 1) \\). Since we're asked for all **distinct** possible values of \\( t \\), I should only count \\( t = 4 \\) once.\n\nSo, the distinct possible values of \\( t \\) are: **4** and **6**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Average of Distinct \\( t \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have all distinct possible values of \\( t \\), I need to find their average. This is straightforward: add them up and divide by the number of values.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{4 + 6}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems correct. I've accounted for all distinct \\( t \\) values and calculated the average properly. Just to be sure, let's quickly recheck the steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Check**\n\n- **Distinct \\( t \\) Values:** Confirmed as 4 and 6.\n- **Average Calculation:** \\( \\frac{4 + 6}{2} = 5 \\). This checks out.\n\nEverything looks good. The approach seems solid, and the calculations align.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Factoring the Polynomial**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nJust to ensure that Vieta's formulas were the best approach, let's try factoring the polynomial \\( x^2 - 5x + t \\) and see if we arrive at the same \\( t \\) values.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nAttempt to factor the polynomial into \\( (x - r_1)(x - r_2) = x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1 r_2 \\).\n\nGiven \\( r_1 + r_2 = 5 \\) and \\( r_1 r_2 = t \\), the factored form would be:\n\\[\n(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = x^2 - 5x + t\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:**  \nList the possible pairs \\( (r_1, r_2) \\) that are positive integers summing to 5, which we've already identified as:\n- \\( (1, 4) \\)\n- \\( (2, 3) \\)\n- \\( (4, 1) \\)\n\n**Step 3:**  \nCalculate \\( t \\) for each pair:\n- \\( (1, 4) \\) \u2192 \\( t = 1 \\times 4 = 4 \\)\n- \\( (2, 3) \\) \u2192 \\( t = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n- \\( (4, 1) \\) \u2192 \\( t = 4 \\times 1 = 4 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis alternative method confirms our initial approach using Vieta's formulas. Both strategies yield the same distinct \\( t \\) values and the same average.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014Vieta's formulas and factoring\u2014I ensured that the solution was robust. Both methods led to the same distinct \\( t \\) values: 4 and 6. Calculating the average gave me 5, which aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\nIt's always good to double-check using an alternative method to validate the answer. This approach not only confirms the correctness but also deepens the understanding of the problem.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe average of all distinct possible values of \\( t \\) is **5**.",

Since $-\\frac{b}{a}$ is the sum and $\\frac{c}{a}$ is the product of the roots of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we have $r_1+r_2=5$ and $r_1r_2=t$. Since $r_1$ and $r_2$ are positive integers, the only possible ordered pairs $(r_1,r_2)$ are $(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),$ and $(4,1)$. These produce the values of 4,6,6, and 4 respectively for $t$. Therefore, the average of the distinct possibilities, 4 and 6, is $\\boxed{5}$."
