    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[\nxy + 5x + 4y = -5\n\\]\n\nI notice that it's a linear equation involving two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). My initial reaction is that it might resemble a system of linear equations or perhaps can be factored somehow. I vaguely remember that factoring might help or maybe rearranging terms could lead to a different insight. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Factoring the Equation:** Maybe I can factor the left side to make it look like a product of two binomials.\n   \n2. **Rearranging Terms:** Perhaps rearranging the equation to isolate one variable could help.\n\n3. **Substitution Method:** If I can express one variable in terms of the other, I could substitute it back into the equation.\n\n4. **Graphical Approach:** Plotting the equation to find integer solutions, although this might be time-consuming without a graphing tool.\n\nI think starting with **Factoring** makes sense because, if successful, it could directly give me the integer solutions. But if that doesn't work, I'll try rearranging the terms. Let's proceed with factoring first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Factor the Equation**\n\nLet's try to factor the equation to see if it gives us any straightforward solutions.\n\n\\[\nxy + 5x + 4y = -5\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI recall that factoring often involves rearranging the equation so that it looks like the product of two binomials. So, maybe I can group terms in a way that makes this possible.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nTry to rearrange and see if it resembles \\((ax + by)(cx + dy) = constant\\).\n\n\\[\nxy + 5x + 4y + 5 = 0 \\quad \\text{(Adding 5 to both sides)}\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't immediately suggest a factoring pattern like a perfect square or difference of squares. In fact, it looks quite messy to factor directly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, this doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Factoring isn't working out because the terms don\u2019t align nicely into a product of binomials. Maybe this strategy isn't the best starting point. Let me think if there\u2019s another approach that might work better.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:**\n\nFactoring doesn\u2019t seem promising here, so I'll move on to rearranging the terms instead.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rearranging the Equation to Isolate \\(y\\)**\n\nLet\u2019s try to rearrange the equation to isolate \\(y\\). This might help in seeing the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) more clearly.\n\n\\[\nxy + 5x + 4y = -5\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI can try to group all terms involving \\(y\\) on one side and see if it leads to a solvable expression. Maybe it will allow me to express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\).\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nMove all \\(y\\)-terms to one side:\n\n\\[\nxy + 4y = -5 - 5x\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\(y\\) on the left side:\n\n\\[\ny(x + 4) = -5 - 5x\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-5 - 5x}{x + 4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks better because now \\(y\\) is expressed in terms of \\(x\\). I can use this to find integer solutions by plugging in integer values for \\(x\\) and checking if \\(y\\) is also an integer.\n\n**Check:**\n\nBefore proceeding, let's verify that this rearrangement is correct.\n\nStarting equation:\n\n\\[\nxy + 5x + 4y = -5\n\\]\n\nI added \\(5y\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\nxy + 5x + 4y + 5y = -5 + 5y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad xy + 5x + 9y = -5 + 5y\n\\]\n\nWait, that's incorrect because I intended to factor out \\(y\\), but added \\(5y\\) unnecessarily. Let me retry that.\n\n**Re-attempt:**\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[\nxy + 5x + 4y = -5\n\\]\n\nMove \\(4y\\) to the right:\n\n\\[\nxy + 5x = -5 - 4y\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t seem helpful. I think I made an error in my initial attempt. Let's backtrack.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, perhaps moving \\(4y\\) to the right isn't helping. Maybe I should attempt a different path altogether.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Trying Substitution by Assuming Values for \\(x\\)**\n\nSince the previous approach didn\u2019t lead anywhere, let's try another method: assuming specific integer values for \\(x\\) and solving for \\(y\\). This might help in finding the greatest possible integer value of \\(y\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven that both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers, I can create a table of possible \\(x\\) values and compute corresponding \\(y\\) values using the rearranged equation:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-5 - 5x}{x + 4}\n\\]\n\nThis is a bit tedious, but it could work. Alternatively, I could look for patterns or constraints that limit the possible values of \\(y\\).\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet's assume different integer values for \\(x\\) and see what \\(y\\) turns out to be:\n\n- **For \\(x = -3\\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-5 - 5(-3)}{-3 + 4} = \\frac{-5 + 15}{1} = \\frac{10}{1} = 10\n\\]\n\n- **For \\(x = -2\\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-5 - 5(-2)}{-2 + 4} = \\frac{-5 + 10}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n\\]\n\n- **For \\(x = -1\\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-5 - 5(-1)}{-1 + 4} = \\frac{-5 + 5}{3} = \\frac{0}{3} = 0\n\\]\n\n- **For \\(x = 0\\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-5 - 5(0)}{0 + 4} = \\frac{-5}{4} = -1.25\n\\]\n\n- **For \\(x = 1\\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-5 - 5(1)}{1 + 4} = \\frac{-5 - 5}{5} = \\frac{-10}{5} = -2\n\\]\n\n- **For \\(x = 2\\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-5 - 5(2)}{2 + 4} = \\frac{-5 - 10}{6} = \\frac{-15}{6} = -2.5\n\\]\n\n- **For \\(x = 3\\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-5 - 5(3)}{3 + 4} = \\frac{-5 - 15}{7} = \\frac{-20}{7} \\approx -2.86\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFrom these calculations, it looks like when \\(x = -3\\), \\(y\\) equals 10, which is the highest integer value we've found so far. But to confirm that this is indeed the greatest possible value of \\(y\\), I should check if there's any other \\(x\\) value that yields a higher \\(y\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s see if increasing \\(x\\) beyond -3 ever yields a higher \\(y\\):\n\n- **For \\(x = -4\\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-5 - 5(-4)}{-4 + 4} = \\frac{-5 + 20}{0}\n\\]\n\nUh-oh, division by zero! This means \\(x = -4\\) is not a valid solution.\n\n- **For \\(x = -5\\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-5 - 5(-5)}{-5 + 4} = \\frac{-5 + 25}{-1} = \\frac{20}{-1} = -20\n\\]\n\n**Observation:**\n\nThe \\(y\\) value drops significantly when \\(x = -5\\). This suggests that moving away from \\(x = -3\\) in either direction (to lower \\(x\\) values) decreases \\(y\\). Therefore, \\(x = -3\\) indeed gives the highest \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's double-check if \\(x = -3\\) and \\(y = 10\\) satisfy the original equation.\n\n**Original Equation:**\n\n\\[\nxy + 5x + 4y = -5\n\\]\n\n**Plugging \\(x = -3\\) and \\(y = 10\\):**\n\n\\[\n(-3)(10) + 5(-3) + 4(10) = -30 - 15 + 40 = -30 - 15 + 40 = -5\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThe left-hand side equals the right-hand side (-5), so the solution \\(x = -3\\) and \\(y = 10\\) satisfies the equation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms that our earlier approach was correct. Assuming integer values for \\(x\\) led us to the maximum integer \\(y\\) value.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\nEven though the substitution approach worked well, it's good to consider if there\u2019s a more efficient method.\n\n**Alternative Thinking:**\n\n1. **Completing the Square:** Maybe rearranging the equation to complete the square could reveal integer solutions.\n\n2. **Integer Constraints:** Since \\(y\\) must be an integer, perhaps analyzing the equation to impose integer constraints on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) could limit the possible values.\n\n3. **Using Diophantine Equations:** Recognizing this as a linear Diophantine equation might provide insights on integer solutions.\n\n**Attempting Completing the Square:**\n\nRearrange the equation differently:\n\n\\[\nxy + 5x + 4y + 20 = 15 \\quad \\text{(Adding 20 to both sides)}\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't seem to simplify nicely into a perfect square. So, I think this method isn't applicable here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGiven that other methods aren\u2019t providing a simpler solution, it's reasonable to stick with the substitution approach that yielded the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step exploration and verification:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe greatest possible value of \\(y\\) that satisfies the equation \\(xy + 5x + 4y = -5\\) is **10**. By assuming integer values for \\(x\\) and calculating \\(y\\), we found that \\(x = -3\\) and \\(y = 10\\) is the solution that maximizes \\(y\\).",

So, add $20$ to both sides of the original equation to get $xy+5x+4y+20=15$, so now we may apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and write the equation as $(x+4)(y+5)=15$.\n\nThen, the potential ordered pairs $((x+4),(y+5))$ with $x<y$ are $(-15,-1)$, $(-5,-3)$, $(1,15)$ and $(3,5)$, since these are the pairs of integers that multiply to 15.  The greatest value for $y+5$ is thus $15$.  We solve $y+5=15$ for $y$ to yield $y=\\boxed{10}$."
