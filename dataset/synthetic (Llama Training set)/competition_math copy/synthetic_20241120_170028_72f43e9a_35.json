The question is about identifying which four-digit number among 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, and 3576 is **not divisible by 4**. After finding that number, I need to determine the product of its **units digit** and **tens digit**.\n\n**First Impressions:**\n\n- **Divisibility by 4:** I remember that a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its **last two digits** is divisible by 4. This makes me think I only need to check the last two digits of each number to determine divisibility.\n  \n- **Checking Each Number:** To start, I could check each number one by one, focusing on the last two digits. However, I'm also considering if there's a more efficient method, like recognizing patterns or utilizing modular arithmetic.\n\n- **Product of Digits:** Once I find the number not divisible by 4, I need to multiply its units and tens digits. So, keeping track of these digits while checking divisibility would be helpful.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Check Last Two Digits:** Directly applying the rule of divisibility by 4.\n   \n2. **Modular Arithmetic:** Using modulo operations to confirm divisibility.\n   \n3. **Alternative Methods:** Perhaps looking for a pattern among the numbers or leveraging known properties of divisible numbers.\n\nLet's start with the most straightforward approach to see if it works.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Checking Divisibility by 4\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI\u2019ll check the **last two digits** of each number to see if they are divisible by 4. According to the rule, if the last two digits form a number that\u2019s divisible by 4, then the whole number is divisible by 4.\n\n**Checking Each Number:**\n\n1. **3544:** Last two digits are **44**.\n   \n   - **Calculation:** \\( 44 \u00f7 4 = 11 \\) \u21d2 **Divisible by 4**\n\n2. **3554:** Last two digits are **54**.\n   \n   - **Calculation:** \\( 54 \u00f7 4 = 13.5 \\) \u21d2 **Not Divisible by 4**\n   \n   - Wait, that can't be right because... it gives a decimal. Let me double-check.\n   \n   - **Reflection:** Oh! Let me re-calculate. \\( 54 \u00f7 4 = 54/4 = 13.5 \\), so indeed, it's **not divisible by 4**.\n\n3. **3564:** Last two digits are **64**.\n   \n   - **Calculation:** \\( 64 \u00f7 4 = 16 \\) \u21d2 **Divisible by 4**\n\n4. **3572:** Last two digits are **72**.\n   \n   - **Calculation:** \\( 72 \u00f7 4 = 18 \\) \u21d2 **Divisible by 4**\n\n5. **3576:** Last two digits are **76**.\n   \n   - **Calculation:** \\( 76 \u00f7 4 = 19 \\) \u21d2 **Divisible by 4**\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nBased on this check, **3554** is **not divisible by 4**, as its last two digits (54) do not form a number divisible by 4.\n\nBut wait, let me ensure that I didn\u2019t make a mistake here. Checking again, **54 \u00f7 4 = 13.5**, which confirms it's not divisible by 4. So, the initial approach seems correct.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Identifying the Target Number\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFrom the divisibility check, **3554** is the number not divisible by 4. Now, I need to find the product of its **units digit** and **tens digit**.\n\n**Identifying Digits:**\n\n- **3554**\n  - **Tens Digit:** \\( 5 \\)\n  - **Units Digit:** \\( 4 \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Product} = \\text{Tens Digit} \u00d7 \\text{Units Digit} = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems straightforward. Multiplying 5 and 4 gives 20. Let me double-check if I correctly identified the tens and units digits; yes, they are positions 2 and 1 from the right, respectively.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Verifying the Approach\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt's always good to verify if the method used is correct. Did checking the last two digits accurately identify the number not divisible by 4? Let's think about it.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Divisibility Rule:** The rule states that a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. I applied this correctly.\n  \n- **Correct Identification:** According to the checks, **3554** was identified as not divisible by 4, and its digits were correctly identified for multiplication.\n\n- **Final Answer:** The product calculated is \\( 20 \\), which aligns with the requirements.\n\nI don\u2019t see any mistakes or need for adjustments in the approach. Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Approach: Modular Arithmetic\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nJust to ensure the accuracy of the initial method, let's consider another approach using **modular arithmetic**. This might confirm our findings.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **3554 Mod 4:**\n\n  \\[\n  3554 \u00f7 4 = 888.5\n  \\]\n  \n  - Wait, that can\u2019t be right because... divisibility by 4 should yield an integer.\n  \n  - **Reflection:** Ah! Let me recheck. I should consider only the last two digits: \\( 54 \u00f7 4 = 13.5 \\). So, **3554 is indeed not divisible by 4**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth methods confirm that **3554** is not divisible by 4, and the product of its tens and units digits is **20**.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThroughout the process:\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Initially considered different strategies, settled on checking the last two digits, which is the most efficient.\n  \n- **Checking Work:** Regularly reflected and verified each step to ensure correctness.\n  \n- **Flexibility:** Opened to alternative methods (like modular arithmetic) to confirm the findings.\n\nEverything aligns, and the final answer is confidently **20**.\n\n**Final Answer:** The product of the units digit and the tens digit of the number not divisible by 4 is **20**.",
