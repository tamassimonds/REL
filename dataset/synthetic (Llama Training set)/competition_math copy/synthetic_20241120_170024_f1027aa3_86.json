    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll walk you through my brainstorming process, explore different strategies, reflect often to ensure I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed. It might get a bit messy, but that's part of thinking through it naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nLooking at the problem, I see two polynomial expressions being subtracted:  \n\\[(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5).\\]\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that this involves **subtracting polynomials**, which reminds me of simplifying expressions by distributing the negative sign. But then, I also recall that factoring typically comes after simplification. So, maybe I need to simplify first and then factor the resulting expression.\n\n**Aha Moment:**\n\nAlright, from my previous experiences, subtracting polynomials is straightforward\u2014distribute the negative sign and combine like terms. Once that's done, factoring should be easier. But I should **double-check** whether there's any special factoring technique that might apply after combining the terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Exploring Different Approaches:**\n\n1. **Distribute the Negative Sign:**\n   - This seems like the most direct approach. I'll subtract the second polynomial from the first by distributing the negative sign.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms:**\n   - After distributing, I'll combine terms that have the same degree to simplify the expression.\n\n3. **Factor the Resulting Polynomial:**\n   - Once simplified, I'll look for common factors or see if it fits any known factoring patterns (like factoring by grouping, recognizing a difference of squares, etc.).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach feels logical. Start by simplifying the expression to make factoring straightforward. But I need to be cautious to ensure each step is accurate, especially when distributing the negative sign.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Executing the First Strategy\u2014Distributing the Negative Sign**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me **distribute the negative sign** across the second polynomial. This should make the subtraction clear.\n\n\\[\n(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5)\n\\]\n\nDistributing the negative:\n\n\\[\n15x^3 + 80x - 5 + 4x^3 - 4x + 5\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, did I distribute correctly? Yes, because:\n\n- Negative times negative \\( (-(-4x^3)) \\) becomes positive \\(+4x^3\\)\n- Negative times positive \\( (-4x) \\) becomes negative \\(-4x\\)\n- Negative times negative \\( (-5) \\) becomes positive \\(+5\\)\n\nLooks good!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combining Like Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I'll **combine the like terms** to simplify the expression.\n\n\\[\n(15x^3 + 4x^3) + (80x - 4x) + (-5 + 5)\n\\]\n\nCalculating each group:\n\n1. **Cubic Terms:**\n   \\[\n   15x^3 + 4x^3 = 19x^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Linear Terms:**\n   \\[\n   80x - 4x = 76x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Constant Terms:**\n   \\[\n   -5 + 5 = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Resulting Expression:**\n\n\\[\n19x^3 + 76x\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me **quick check**\u2014does this make sense? Yes, because all like terms were correctly combined. The constant term cancels out, leaving only the variables.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Factoring the Resulting Polynomial**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to **factor** \\(19x^3 + 76x\\). I remember that factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) is usually a good start.\n\n**Exploring Different Approaches:**\n\n1. **Find the GCF:**\n   - What common factor do \\(19x^3\\) and \\(76x\\) share?\n\n2. **Factor by Grouping:**\n   - If GCF doesn't work, maybe try grouping the terms, but I suspect GCF will suffice here.\n\n**Finding the GCF:**\n\n- Coefficients: \n  - \\(19\\) and \\(76\\): \n  - \\(19\\) is a **prime number**, and \\(76 = 19 \\times 4\\), so the GCF is \\(19\\).\n\n- Variables:\n  - Both terms have \\(x\\), so the GCF is \\(19x\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis feels right. Factoring out \\(19x\\) should simplify the expression. Let's proceed.\n\n**Factoring Out the GCF:**\n\n\\[\n19x^3 + 76x = 19x(x^2 + 4)\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs \\(x^2 + 4\\) factorizable further? Thinking back, \\(x^2 + 4\\) is a **sum of squares**, and I recall that not all sums of squares can be factored over the real numbers. \n\nSpecifically, \\(x^2 + a^2\\) doesn't factor into real polynomials unless \\(a\\) is zero or using complex numbers. But since the question likely expects real factors, \\(x^2 + 4\\) remains as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Expression and Verification**\n\n**Final Factored Expression:**\n\n\\[\n19x(x^2 + 4)\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me **verify** by expanding back to see if I get the original simplified expression.\n\n\\[\n19x(x^2 + 4) = 19x \\cdot x^2 + 19x \\cdot 4 = 19x^3 + 76x\n\\]\n\nIt checks out!\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe factoring is correct, and the verification confirms that no mistakes were made in the process.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step\u2014starting with distributing the negative sign, combining like terms, and then factoring out the greatest common factor\u2014I arrived at the completely factored expression:\n\n\\[\n19x(x^2 + 4)\n\\]\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure to check each step to ensure accuracy, reflecting and adjusting my approach as needed. This methodical thinking helped in successfully factoring the given expression.",
