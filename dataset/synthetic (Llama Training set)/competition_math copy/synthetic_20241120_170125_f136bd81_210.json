Just like tackling a problem in real life, I\u2019ll be open to changing my approach if something doesn\u2019t seem correct.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**User Query:**\n*For how many two-digit prime numbers is the sum of its digits 8?*\n\nHmmm, at first glance, this looks like a combination of number theory and basic properties of digits. Two-digit prime numbers... okay, that narrows it down. Prime numbers are those greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **List Two-Digit Prime Numbers:**\n   - Maybe I can list all two-digit prime numbers and see which ones have digits that sum up to 8.\n\n2. **Check Digit Sum First:**\n   - Alternatively, I could find all two-digit numbers where the sum of digits is 8 and then check which of these are prime.\n\n3. **Use Properties of Primes:**\n   - Perhaps there's a property of prime numbers or the digit sum that could simplify things.\n\nI\u2019ll start with listing two-digit primes and checking their digit sums. If that feels cumbersome, I\u2019ll try the other approach.\n\n### **Step 1: Listing Two-Digit Prime Numbers**\n\nLet\u2019s go ahead and list all two-digit primes:\n\n- **Two-digit primes:** 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, I\u2019ve got my list. There are 21 two-digit primes. Now, I need to check which of these have digits that sum up to 8.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Sum of Digits**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll calculate the sum of digits for each prime number listed:\n\n- **11:** 1 + 1 = 2\n- **13:** 1 + 3 = 4\n- **17:** 1 + 7 = 8\n- **19:** 1 + 9 = 10\n- **23:** 2 + 3 = 5\n- **29:** 2 + 9 = 11\n- **31:** 3 + 1 = 4\n- **37:** 3 + 7 = 10\n- **41:** 4 + 1 = 5\n- **43:** 4 + 3 = 7\n- **47:** 4 + 7 = 11\n- **53:** 5 + 3 = 8\n- **59:** 5 + 9 = 14\n- **61:** 6 + 1 = 7\n- **67:** 6 + 7 = 13\n- **71:** 7 + 1 = 8\n- **73:** 7 + 3 = 10\n- **79:** 7 + 9 = 16\n- **83:** 8 + 3 = 11\n- **89:** 8 + 9 = 17\n- **97:** 9 + 7 = 16\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait a second\u2014I see a pattern. Only a few primes have digits that sum to 8. Let\u2019s list them out:\n\n- **17:** Sum = 8\n- **53:** Sum = 8\n- **71:** Sum = 8\n\nHmm, so there are only three primes where the sum of the digits is 8.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Primality of These Numbers**\n\nLet me double-check that 17, 53, and 71 are indeed prime:\n\n- **17:** Only divisible by 1 and 17.\n- **53:** Only divisible by 1 and 53.\n- **71:** Only divisible by 1 and 71.\n\n**Reflection:**\nYes, all three numbers are prime. So, the initial approach seems correct. But just to be sure, let\u2019s consider the alternative method.\n\n### **Step 4: Alternative Approach\u2014Finding All Numbers with Digit Sum 8**\n\nLet\u2019s see if listing all two-digit numbers with digit sums of 8 and checking their primality gives the same result.\n\n**Two-Digit Numbers with Digit Sum 8:**\n\n- **17:** 1 + 7 = 8\n- **26:** 2 + 6 = 8\n- **35:** 3 + 5 = 8\n- **44:** 4 + 4 = 8\n- **53:** 5 + 3 = 8\n- **62:** 6 + 2 = 8\n- **71:** 7 + 1 = 8\n- **80:** 8 + 0 = 8\n- **89:** 8 + 9 = 8\n\n**Prime Check:**\nFrom this list, the primes are 17, 53, and 71. \n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth methods yield the same primes. That\u2019s reassuring. It confirms that the initial approach was correct. \n\n### **Step 5: Final Count**\n\nSo, there are **three** two-digit prime numbers whose digits sum to 8: **17, 53, and 71.**\n\n**Quick Check:**\nLet me quickly verify: \n\n- **17:** 1 + 7 = 8\n- **53:** 5 + 3 = 8\n- **71:** 7 + 1 = 8\n\nYup, all three satisfy the condition.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Strategy Worked:** Starting with listing two-digit primes and checking their digit sums was effective.\n  \n- **Alternative Method Confirmed:** Listing numbers with digit sums of 8 and checking for primality provided the same result, validating the first approach.\n\n- **Reflection Throughout Helped:** Constant checking and reflecting ensured that the solution was correct without missing any primes.\n\nIn conclusion, there are **3** two-digit prime numbers whose digits sum to 8: **17, 53, and 71.**",

  "ground_truth": "The possibilities for the two digits are 0 and 8, 1 and 7, 2 and 6, 3 and 5, and 4 and 4. Of these, a prime number could only be made from the 1 and 7 or the 3 and 5. 17, 71, and 53 are prime, but 35 is not. Thus, there are $\\boxed{3}$ such two-digit prime numbers."
