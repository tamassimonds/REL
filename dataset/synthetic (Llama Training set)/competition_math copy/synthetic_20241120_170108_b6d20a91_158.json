I\u2019ll start by brainstorming and exploring different strategies, checking my work often, reflecting on whether each step makes sense, and adjusting my approach as needed. This human-like thinking process will help ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem is to find all \\( x \\) such that \\( x^2 + 5x < 6 \\). We need to express the solution in interval notation.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This seems like a quadratic inequality. I\u2019ve dealt with quadratic equations before, so maybe I can use a similar approach. But wait, inequalities are a bit different from equations. I have to be careful with the signs when multiplying or dividing by negative numbers.\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure how to start. Should I try moving everything to one side like I would with an equation? Or maybe graphing could help visualize the solution.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Rearrange the Inequality:** Move all terms to one side to set it to zero.\n2. **Graph the Quadratic Function:** Plotting \\( y = x^2 + 5x \\) and \\( y = 6 \\) to see where they intersect could give me the solution.\n3. **Use the Quadratic Formula:** Find the roots of the corresponding equation to determine the boundary points.\n4. **Test Points in Each Interval:** After finding the roots, test points to see where the inequality holds.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI think starting by rearranging the inequality makes sense. This will give me a standard form to work with. From there, I can maybe find the roots and then decide whether to graph or test intervals. Let's try that and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rearranging the Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s move all terms to one side to set the inequality to zero. This should help in identifying the roots.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x - 6 < 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this look correct? Yes, I\u2019ve just subtracted 6 from both sides, which is a valid operation for inequalities.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Roots of the Corresponding Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNext, I need to find the points where the quadratic expression equals zero. These points will help me determine the intervals for testing later.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet\u2019s solve \\( x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 5 \\), and \\( c = -6 \\).\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4(1)(-6) = 25 + 24 = 49\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-5 \\pm 7}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the roots are:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-12}{2} = -6\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, these roots are \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -6 \\). Let me quickly verify:\n\n\\[\n1^2 + 5(1) - 6 = 1 + 5 - 6 = 0 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\\[\n(-6)^2 + 5(-6) - 6 = 36 - 30 - 6 = 0 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\nBoth roots satisfy the equation, so they\u2019re correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Graphing the Quadratic Function**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo better understand the inequality, let\u2019s graph \\( y = x^2 + 5x \\) and \\( y = 6 \\). This will help visualize where the quadratic is less than 6.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGraphing might take a bit of time, but it can provide a clear picture. If I see where the parabola is below the horizontal line \\( y = 6 \\), I can identify the solution intervals.\n\n**Sketch:**\n\n- The parabola opens upwards (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive).\n- The roots are \\( x = -6 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\).\n- The vertex of the parabola is at \\( x = \\frac{-b}{2a} = \\frac{-5}{2} = -2.5 \\).\n\n**Observation:**\n\nFrom the graph:\n\n- Between the roots (\\( x = -6 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\)), the parabola is below \\( y = 6 \\).\n- Outside the roots, the parabola is above \\( y = 6 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this match with the inequality \\( x^2 + 5x < 6 \\)? Yes, the solution set is where the parabola is below the line \\( y = 6 \\), which corresponds to the interval between the roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Testing Points in Each Interval**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo confirm our observations from the graph, let\u2019s test points in each of the three intervals determined by the roots: \\( (-\\infty, -6) \\), \\( (-6, 1) \\), and \\( (1, \\infty) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nTesting points is a good way to double-check. If the point satisfies the inequality, we know that entire interval is part of the solution.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Interval \\( (-\\infty, -6) \\):**  \n   Let\u2019s test \\( x = -7 \\):\n   \\[\n   (-7)^2 + 5(-7) - 6 = 49 - 35 - 6 = 8 > 0 \\quad \\text{(Does not satisfy)}\n   \\]\n   \n   So, \\( (-\\infty, -6) \\) is **not** part of the solution.\n\n2. **Interval \\( (-6, 1) \\):**  \n   Let\u2019s test \\( x = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   0^2 + 5(0) - 6 = 0 - 6 = -6 < 0 \\quad \\text{(Satisfies)}\n   \\]\n   \n   So, \\( (-6, 1) \\) **is** part of the solution.\n\n3. **Interval \\( (1, \\infty) \\):**  \n   Let\u2019s test \\( x = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   2^2 + 5(2) - 6 = 4 + 10 - 6 = 8 > 0 \\quad \\text{(Does not satisfy)}\n   \\]\n   \n   So, \\( (1, \\infty) \\) is **not** part of the solution.\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, this aligns with what the graph showed. Only the interval \\( (-6, 1) \\) satisfies the inequality.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Expressing the Solution in Interval Notation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve determined which interval satisfies the inequality, we can express the solution in interval notation.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nSince the inequality is strict (\\( < \\)), the endpoints \\( x = -6 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\) are **not** included in the solution. Therefore, the solution set is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-6, 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, the solution \\( (-6, 1) \\) corresponds to where the parabola \\( y = x^2 + 5x \\) is below \\( y = 6 \\). The endpoints are not included because the inequality is strict.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me quickly recheck all steps to ensure everything is correct.\n\n- **Step 2:** Rearranged the inequality correctly.\n- **Step 3:** Found the correct roots using the quadratic formula.\n- **Step 4:** Graphing supported our findings.\n- **Step 5:** Testing points confirmed the solution interval.\n- **Step 6:** Interval notation correctly reflected the solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The interval \\( (-6, 1) \\) is indeed where \\( x^2 + 5x < 6 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThrough brainstorming, exploring different strategies, and verifying each step, we've determined that the solution to the inequality \\( x^2 + 5x < 6 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-6, 1)}\n\\]\n\nThis process involved rearranging the inequality, finding the roots of the corresponding equation, graphing to visualize the solution, and testing points to confirm the correct interval. Regular checks ensured the accuracy of each step, leading to a correct and confident solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get the quadratic  \\begin{align*} x^2+5x-6&<0 \\quad \\Rightarrow\n\\\\ (x+6)(x-1)&<0.\n\\end{align*} Since -6 and 1 are both roots of the quadratic, the inequality changes signs at these two points. So, we need to test the signs of three ranges of numbers: $x<-6$, $-6<x<1$, $x>1$. When $x<-6$, both $(x+6)$ and $(x-1)$ will be negative, thus making the inequality positive. When $-6<x<1$, only $(x-1)$ will be negative, thus making the inequality negative. Finally when $x>1$, both $(x+6)$ and $(x-1)$ will be positive, thus making the inequality positive once again. Therefore, the only range of $x$ that satisfies the inequality is $\\boxed{(-6, 1)}$."
