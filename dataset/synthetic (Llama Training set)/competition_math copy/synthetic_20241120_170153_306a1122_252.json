    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I would naturally approach it if I were solving it for the first time.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming the Problem**\n\nWhen I first see the question, it reminds me of probability and expected value concepts I've encountered before. Here's what stands out to me:\n\n- **Expected Value (EV)**: This is a term I've come across in probability. It typically involves calculating a weighted average based on possible outcomes and their probabilities.\n  \n- **Slips with Numbers 2 and 7**: It's clear that there are two types of slips, which makes me think about proportions or ratios.\n\n- **Total Slips**: There are 12 slips in total, which is a nice round number for calculations.\n\n- **Given EV of $3.25**: This is the average value we should be aiming at with our calculations.\n\nInitially, I'm thinking, \"Wait, I need to connect the proportions of slips with 2s and 7s to the given expected value.\" But I'm not immediately sure how to set it up. Maybe I need to assign variables to represent the number of 2s and 7s and then create an equation based on the expected value.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Assign Variables Approach**:\n   - Let\u2019s assign \\( x \\) to represent the number of slips with a 2.\n   - Then, \\( 12 - x \\) would be the number of slips with a 7 (since there are 12 slips total).\n\n   But I'm thinking, \"Is there a simpler way? Maybe I can use probabilities directly.\"\n\n2. **Probability Weighted Average Approach**:\n   - Consider the probabilities of drawing a slip with a 2 or a 7.\n   - Calculate the expected value using these probabilities.\n\n   This seems more straightforward. Let's see if it leads us to the solution.\n\n3. **Check Total Value Approach**:\n   - Total value contributed by all slips should equal the expected value multiplied by the number of slips: \\( 12 \\times 3.25 = 39 \\).\n\n   But I'm realizing this might not directly help without knowing the proportions of 2s and 7s.\n\n---\n\n### **Deciding on a Strategy: Let's Use Probabilities**\n\nI think the **Probability Weighted Average Approach** makes the most sense here. It directly relates the expected value to the proportions of each type of slip. If this doesn't work, I can always backtrack and try the Assign Variables Approach instead.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define Probabilities**\n\nLet's define the probabilities for drawing each type of slip:\n\n- Probability of drawing a slip with a 2, \\( P(2) \\) = \\( \\frac{x}{12} \\)\n- Probability of drawing a slip with a 7, \\( P(7) \\) = \\( \\frac{12 - x}{12} \\)\n\nI\u2019m thinking, \"These probabilities should sum up to 1, but that's already the case since they represent all possible slips.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Set Up the Expected Value Equation**\n\nThe expected value is calculated as the sum of the possible outcomes weighted by their probabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{EV} = P(2) \\times 2 + P(7) \\times 7\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the probabilities:\n\n\\[\n3.25 = \\frac{x}{12} \\times 2 + \\frac{12 - x}{12} \\times 7\n\\]\n\nThis looks like a solid equation to work with. Let's proceed to simplify it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplify the Equation**\n\nFirst, let's multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n3.25 \\times 12 = 2x + 7(12 - x)\n\\]\n\nCalculating the left side:\n\n\\[\n39 = 2x + 84 - 7x\n\\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\[\n39 = 84 - 5x\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n39 - 84 = -5x \\implies -45 = -5x\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\nTo find \\( x \\), divide both sides by -5:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-45}{-5} = 9\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( x = 9 \\). This means there are **9 slips with a 2**.\n\nI'm thinking, \"Wait, let me quickly check if this makes sense.\" If there are 9 slips with a 2, then \\( 12 - 9 = 3 \\) slips have a 7. Let's verify the expected value with these numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Quick Verification**\n\nLet's plug \\( x = 9 \\) back into the expected value equation to ensure it's correct:\n\n\\[\nP(2) = \\frac{9}{12} = 0.75, \\quad P(7) = \\frac{3}{12} = 0.25\n\\]\n\nCalculating the expected value:\n\n\\[\n\\text{EV} = 0.75 \\times 2 + 0.25 \\times 7 = 1.5 + 1.75 = 3.25\n\\]\n\nThis matches the given expected value, so our solution is correct!\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection: Checking the Approach**\n\n- **Does the Number Make Sense?**: Having 9 slips with a 2 and 3 slips with a 7 adds up to 12, which is correct.\n\n- **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value calculation aligns perfectly with the given \\( 3.25 \\), confirming the correctness.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies**: Initially, I considered using the Assign Variables Approach, but the Probability Weighted Average Approach streamlined the process effectively.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Is There Another Way to Approach This?**\n\nWhile the Probability Weighted Average Approach worked well, another way could be setting up a system of equations based on total slips and expected value. However, given that our current method provided a direct and efficient solution, it seems unnecessary to complicate things further.\n\nI'm satisfied with the solution:\n\nThere are **9 slips with a 2** in the bag.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy thinking through different strategies, selecting the most straightforward approach, and verifying the solution, I've arrived confidently at the answer. It's essential to reflect and check each step, ensuring the method works correctly before concluding. This step-by-step process, complete with brainstorming and checking, mirrors a natural human problem-solving journey.",

  "ground_truth": "We let $x$ denote the number of slips with a 2 written on them.  (This is the usual tactic of letting a variable denote what we're trying to solve for in the problem.)  Then there are $12-x$ slips with a 7 on them. The probability of drawing a 2 is $\\frac{x}{12}$ and the probability of drawing a 7 is $\\frac{12-x}{12}$, so the expected value of the number drawn is $$ E = \\frac{x}{12}(2) + \\frac{12-x}{12}(7) = \\frac{84-5x}{12}. $$But we are given that $E=3.25$, so we have the equation $$ 3.25 = \\frac{84-5x}{12}. $$This simplifies to $39 = 84 - 5x$, which means that $x = 9$. Thus $\\boxed{9}$ of the 12 slips have a 2 written on them."
