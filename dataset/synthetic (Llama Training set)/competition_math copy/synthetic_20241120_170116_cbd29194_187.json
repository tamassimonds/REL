    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem like we would if we were working through it ourselves. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I see the equation \\(2 - iz = -1 + 3iz\\), my immediate reaction is that it involves complex numbers due to the imaginary unit \\(i\\). The presence of \\(z\\) in both sides suggests that we need to isolate \\(z\\) to find its value.\n\n- **Initial Idea:** Maybe I can rearrange the equation to get all terms involving \\(z\\) on one side and constants on the other. This looks like a basic linear equation, but with complex coefficients.\n- **Alternative Thought:** Alternatively, I could try factoring if it resembles a quadratic, but it doesn't look like that at first glance.\n\n**Reflection:**\nSince there are both real and imaginary parts, and \\(z\\) appears linearly, I think isolating \\(z\\) is the right path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Listing Possible Approaches:**\n1. **Rearrangement Method:** Move all terms involving \\(z\\) to one side and constants to the other.\n2. **Graphical Method:** Plotting the equation to find intersections (but this might be overkill for a simple equation).\n3. **Substitution Method:** Solving for \\(z\\) by substituting known values (not applicable here since we have one equation).\n4. **Complex Conjugate:** Multiplying by the conjugate if needed (doesn't seem necessary now).\n\n**Choosing a Strategy:**\nThe **Rearrangement Method** seems the most straightforward. I\u2019ll try moving all \\(z\\)-terms to one side.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Rearrangement Method**\n\n**Starting to Rearrange:**\nLet's move all terms involving \\(z\\) to one side:\n\n\\[\n2 - iz = -1 + 3iz\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I want to get all \\(iz\\) on one side. It looks like moving \\(3iz\\) to the left and \\(2\\) to the right would work.\n- But maybe I should also factor out \\(z\\) later if needed.\n\n**Performing the Move:**\nSubtract \\(3iz\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2 - iz - 3iz = -1 + 3iz - 3iz\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2 - 4iz = -1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait, does that seem right? Let me double-check:\n- Original: \\(2 - iz = -1 + 3iz\\)\n- Moved \\(3iz\\) to the left: \\(2 - 4iz = -1\\)\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Isolating \\(z\\)**\n\n**Next Step:**\nNow, I need to isolate \\(z\\) in the equation \\(2 - 4iz = -1\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- First, get rid of the constant on the left side by moving \\(2\\) to the right.\n- Then, divide by the coefficient of \\(z\\) to solve for \\(z\\).\n\n**Performing the Move:**\nSubtract \\(2\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-4iz = -1 - 2\n\\]\n\nSimplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-4iz = -3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nLet's see if subtracting \\(2\\) from \\(-1\\) gives \\(-3\\):\n\\(-1 - 2 = -3\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving for \\(z\\)**\n\n**Now:**\nWe have \\(-4iz = -3\\). Need to solve for \\(z\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Divide both sides by \\(-4i\\) to isolate \\(z\\).\n- Since we're dealing with complex numbers, dividing by \\(i\\) might introduce a negative sign, so let's be careful.\n\n**Performing the Division:**\n\\[\nz = \\frac{-3}{-4i} = \\frac{3}{4i}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes dividing by \\(-4i\\) make sense? \n- \\(-4i\\) divided into \\(-3\\) gives \\(z = \\frac{3}{4i}\\), which looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Simplifying the Complex Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Typically, we express complex numbers in standard form \\(a + bi\\) by eliminating the imaginary unit \\(i\\) from the denominator.\n- To do this, multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.\n\n**Applying the Conjugate:**\nMultiply by \\(-i\\):\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{3}{4i} \\times \\frac{-i}{-i} = \\frac{3(-i)}{4i(-i)} = \\frac{-3i}{4(-i^2)} = \\frac{-3i}{4 \\times 1} = \\frac{-3i}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Multiplying by \\(-i\\):** This gets rid of \\(i\\) in the denominator.\n- **Simplifying:** \\(-i^2 = 1\\), so the denominator simplifies to \\(4\\).\n\n**Final Result:**\n\\[\nz = -\\frac{3}{4}i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nDoes this make sense? The imaginary part is present, aligning with the original equation's terms. I feel confident that this is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- It's always good to plug the solution back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the condition.\n\n**Substituting Back:**\nOriginal equation: \\(2 - iz = -1 + 3iz\\)\n\nSubstituting \\(z = -\\frac{3}{4}i\\):\n\nLeft Side:\n\\[\n2 - i\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}i\\right) = 2 + \\frac{3}{4}i^2 = 2 + \\frac{3}{4}(-1) = 2 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\nRight Side:\n\\[\n-1 + 3i\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}i\\right) = -1 - \\frac{9}{4}i^2 = -1 - \\frac{9}{4}(-1) = -1 + \\frac{9}{4} = -\\frac{4}{4} + \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Comparison:**\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nBoth sides are equal, which confirms that our solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies and carefully applying the rearrangement method, we isolated \\(z\\) to find:\n\n\\[\nz = -\\frac{3}{4}i\n\\]\n\nBy verifying the solution within the original equation, we ensured its correctness. Throughout the process, checking each step helped catch potential errors and validate the approach, making the solution reliable.",
