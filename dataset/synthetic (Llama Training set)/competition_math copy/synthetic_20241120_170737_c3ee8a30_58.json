I remember that properties of exponents can help simplify expressions like this.\n  \n- **Base Conversion:** Maybe I can express both terms with the same base to simplify the division.\n  \n- **Prime Factorization:** Another option is to break down the numbers into their prime factors to see if anything cancels out.\n  \n- **Alternative Strategies:** If base conversion doesn't work smoothly, perhaps using the property of exponents in division might help.\n\nHonestly, at first glance, I'm leaning towards converting both numbers to the same base. That might make it easier to deal with the exponents.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n  \n- **Strategy 1:** Convert \\(36\\) to a power of \\(6\\) since \\(6\\) is a factor of \\(36\\).\n  \n- **Strategy 2:** Use exponent rules directly without converting bases.\n  \n- **Strategy 3:** Prime factorization of both bases to see if there's a common pattern.\n\nLet\u2019s start with **Strategy 1** \u2014 converting \\(36\\) to a power of \\(6\\), since that seems straightforward and might simplify the problem.\n\n### Step 2: **Attempting Strategy 1 - Base Conversion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo make the division easier, I\u2019ll try to express both \\(6^{12}\\) and \\(36^5\\) with the same base. I remember that:\n\\[ 36 = 6^2 \\]\n\nSo, maybe I can rewrite \\(36^5\\) as:\n\\[ 36^5 = (6^2)^5 \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n(6^2)^5 = 6^{2 \\times 5} = 6^{10}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right initially because I thought I should convert \\(36^5\\) directly to \\(6^{10}\\). But I need to ensure that both sides match up correctly.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n\\[\n(6^2)^5 = 6^{10} \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\nAlright, so now the expression becomes:\n\\[ 6^{12} \\div 6^{10} \\]\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nThis looks much more manageable. Let\u2019s see how to simplify it further using exponent rules.\n\n### Step 3: **Simplifying Exponents in Division**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWhen dividing exponents with the same base, I recall the rule:\n\\[ a^m \\div a^n = a^{m-n} \\]\n\nSo applying that here:\n\\[ 6^{12} \\div 6^{10} = 6^{12-10} = 6^2 \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n6^{12} \\div 6^{10} = 6^{12-10} = 6^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems correct! By applying the exponent rule, I\u2019ve simplified the expression to \\(6^2\\). Let\u2019s check if \\(6^2\\) makes sense in the context of the original problem.\n\n### Step 4: **Final Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we have simplified the expression to \\(6^2\\), let's compute that:\n\\[ 6^2 = 36 \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n6^2 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe final answer is \\(36\\). This makes sense because dividing \\(6^{12}\\) by \\(36^5\\) simplified down to \\(6^2\\), which is indeed \\(36\\).\n\n### Step 5: **Cross-Checking the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me verify each part to ensure everything is correct. I\u2019ll check:\n\n1. **Base Conversion:** Was \\(36^5\\) correctly converted to \\(6^{10}\\)?\n2. **Exponent Rule Application:** Did I apply the exponent division rule correctly?\n3. **Final Calculation:** Is \\(6^2\\) indeed \\(36\\)?\n\n**Checking Base Conversion:**\n\n\\[\n36 = 6^2 \\implies (6^2)^5 = 6^{2 \\times 5} = 6^{10} \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\n**Checking Exponent Rule:**\n\n\\[\n6^{12} \\div 6^{10} = 6^{12-10} = 6^2 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\n**Checking Final Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n6^2 = 36 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out! The approach was correct, and the final answer is indeed \\(36\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy converting \\(36\\) to a power of \\(6\\), I was able to simplify the division using exponent rules. Initially, I considered different strategies like prime factorization and direct exponent rules, but converting to the same base proved to be the most straightforward approach. Throughout the process, checking each step ensured the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n36\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "We can express a power of 36 as a power of 6, since $36 = 6^2$.  Then, $36^5 = 6^{10}$.  Dividing, we get $6^{12} \\div 6^{10} = 6^{12-10}= 6^2$. This gives us $\\boxed{36}$."
