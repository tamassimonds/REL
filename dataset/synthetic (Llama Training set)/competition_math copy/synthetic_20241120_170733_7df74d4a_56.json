If he hangs the pieces of art in a row in a random order, what is the probability that all three pieces by Escher will be placed consecutively?*\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of probability problems involving arranging items where certain conditions must be met. It feels somewhat similar to problems where you arrange letters in a word with specific letters together, like treating certain letters as a single unit if they need to be adjacent.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to approach it right away. My initial instinct is to consider counting the number of favorable arrangements (where the Escher prints are together) and comparing it to the total number of possible arrangements. But let's think this through a bit more.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Total Arrangements Method:** \n   - Count the total number of ways to arrange all 10 pieces of art.\n   - Count the number of favorable arrangements where the Escher prints are together.\n   - Probability would be the ratio of these two.\n\n2. **Grouping Method:**\n   - Treat the three Escher prints as a single unit or \"block.\" This simplifies the problem by reducing the total number of items to arrange.\n   - Calculate the total arrangements with this block.\n\n3. **Complementary Counting:**\n   - Instead of directly finding the probability of the Escher prints being together, find the probability of them NOT being together and subtract from 1.\n\nHmm, the **Grouping Method** seems like it could simplify things by reducing the number of items to consider. Let's try that first.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Grouping Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf I treat the three Escher prints as a single block or unit, I reduce the problem to arranging 8 items (7 individual pieces + 1 block). This way, I can easily calculate the total number of favorable arrangements.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Total Number of Items to Arrange:**\n   - 10 pieces total\n   - 3 Escher prints considered as one block\n   - So, 10 - 3 + 1 = **8 items to arrange**\n\n2. **Number of Favorable Arrangements:**\n   - Arrange the 8 items: 8! (factorial of 8)\n\n3. **Number of Ways to Arrange the Escher Prints Within the Block:**\n   - The 3 Escher prints can be arranged among themselves: 3!\n\n4. **Total Favorable Arrangements:**\n   - Multiply the two: 8! \u00d7 3!\n\n5. **Total Number of Possible Arrangements Without Any Constraints:**\n   - All 10 items are distinct: 10!\n\n**Probability Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Favorable Arrangements}}{\\text{Total Arrangements}} = \\frac{8! \\times 3!}{10!}\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\nHmm, let me check this. Multiplying 8! by 3! and then dividing by 10! seems straightforward, but I want to ensure this approach adequately captures all scenarios.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n*Does this make sense?*\n\n- By treating the Escher prints as a block, I'm ensuring they're always together, which aligns with the problem's requirement.\n- The division by 10! accounts for all possible arrangements without constraints, so the ratio should give the correct probability.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach seems logical. By simplifying the problem into arranging blocks and then accounting for internal arrangements, I think we're on the right track. But let's calculate it to be sure.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, let's compute the factorials to get the numerical probability.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Compute Factorials:**\n   - \\( 8! = 40,320 \\)\n   - \\( 3! = 6 \\)\n   - \\( 10! = 3,628,800 \\)\n\n2. **Multiply 8! and 3!:**\n   \\[\n   40,320 \\times 6 = 241,920\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide by 10!:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{241,920}{3,628,800} = \\frac{1}{15}\n   \\]\n\n**Hmm, the probability is \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\).**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me think about this. A probability of \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\) seems plausible. It's not too close to zero, which would indicate it's very unlikely, nor too high, which would make it almost certain. Given that we have specific constraints (the Escher prints need to be together), this seems reasonable.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore concluding, let's verify if the Grouping Method is indeed the best approach by considering alternative strategies.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Complementary Counting**\n\n*Maybe I can check if the probability of the Escher prints NOT being together adds up correctly.*\n\n1. **Total Arrangements Without Constraints:**\n   - As calculated: \\( 10! = 3,628,800 \\)\n\n2. **Arrangements Where Escher Prints Are NOT Together:**\n   - This is a bit trickier. I would need to calculate the number of ways to arrange the 10 pieces such that no two Escher prints are adjacent.\n   - But given the simplicity of the Grouping Method, and since we already have a probability calculation, it might be overcomplicating things.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSince the Grouping Method gave a clear and logical probability, and verifying it numerically makes sense, I think it's safe to conclude our solution here. Exploring the complementary counting would only add complexity without necessarily providing a simpler solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully walking through the Grouping Method and verifying the calculations, the probability that all three pieces by Escher will be placed consecutively is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{15}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by considering different strategies\u2014Grouping Method, Total Arrangements, and Complementary Counting.\n- **Approach:** Chose the Grouping Method for its simplicity and directness in treating the Escher prints as a single block.\n- **Calculations:** Worked through factorials to find the probability.\n- **Verification:** Checked the logic and considered alternative methods to ensure correctness.\n- **Reflection:** Throughout, made sure each step made sense and adjusted strategies as needed, confirming the final probability as \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "To count the number of ways of arranging the 10 pieces of art with the three Escher's consecutively, treat the three of them as one item. It is clear that we are then selecting the location of 1 item out of 8 total which can be done in $\\binom{8}{1}=8$ ways. There are also a total of $\\binom{10}{3}=120$ ways to place the three pictures without restrictions. Thus the probability that we want is $\\dfrac{8}{120}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{15}}$."
