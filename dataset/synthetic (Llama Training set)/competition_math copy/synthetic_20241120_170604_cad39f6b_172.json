    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I\u2019ll brainstorm and reflect often, exploring different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving this problem on my own.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question asks for the **$y$-intercept** of the line given by the equation \\(x - 2y = 5\\). \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **What is a $y$-intercept?**: I remember that the $y$-intercept is the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis. At this point, the value of \\(x\\) is zero.\n  \n- **How do I find it?**: There are a couple of methods that come to mind:\n  1. **Substitute \\(x = 0\\) into the equation**: This should give me the corresponding \\(y\\) value.\n  2. **Rearranging the equation to slope-intercept form (\\(y = mx + b\\))**: This would directly show the $y$-intercept as \\(b\\).\n  \n- **Which method should I choose?**: Both seem valid, but substituting \\(x = 0\\) looks straightforward for this specific problem. However, practicing with both might reinforce my understanding.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Substituting \\(x = 0\\)**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first method\u2014substituting \\(x = 0\\) into the equation.\n\n**Step 1: Substitute \\(x = 0\\) into the equation.**\n\n\\[\n0 - 2y = 5\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Does this make sense? Setting \\(x = 0\\) should isolate \\(y\\) and give me the \\(y\\)-intercept.\n  \n- I can simplify the equation to solve for \\(y\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the equation.**\n\n\\[\n-2y = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, that seems straightforward. Dividing both sides by \\(-2\\) should give me \\(y\\).\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\(y\\).**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5}{-2} = -\\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- So the \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\). That seems reasonable. \n\n- Let me quickly verify: If \\(x = 0\\), then the equation reduces to \\(-2y = 5\\), and dividing by \\(-2\\) gives \\(y = -\\frac{5}{2}\\). \n\n**Conclusion of Strategy 1:**\n\nAlright, substituting \\(x = 0\\) worked perfectly. But let's also try the second method to ensure our answer is correct.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Rearranging to Slope-Intercept Form**\n\nNow, let\u2019s see if rearranging the equation to \\(y = mx + b\\) gives the same \\(y\\)-intercept.\n\n**Step 1: Start with the original equation.**\n\n\\[\nx - 2y = 5\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need to get \\(y\\) by itself on one side. \n\n- Let\u2019s move \\(x\\) to the other side by subtracting it from both sides.\n\n**Step 2: Rearrange the equation.**\n\n\\[\n-2y = 5 - x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This looks good. Now, I\u2019ll divide both sides by \\(-2\\) to solve for \\(y\\).\n\n**Step 3: Divide by \\(-2\\).**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5 - x}{-2} = -\\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Wait a minute, this looks like the slope-intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(b = -\\frac{5}{2}\\). \n\n- So, the \\(y\\)-intercept is indeed \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\), just as we found earlier.\n\n**Conclusion of Strategy 2:**\n\nBoth methods agree that the \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\). This reinforces that our solution is correct.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Does the answer make sense?**: Yes, the \\(y\\)-intercept \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\) fits logically within the context of the problem.\n\n- **Did both strategies lead to the same result?**: Absolutely, both methods confirmed the \\(y\\)-intercept.\n\n- **Would it be beneficial to double-check in different ways?**: While both strategies provided the correct answer, trying additional methods like graphing could offer further confirmation. However, for this problem, verifying through both algebraic methods suffices.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\n- **Wait, could there be hidden complexities?**: With a linear equation like this, the methods are straightforward. However, if the equation were more complex (e.g., quadratic), different strategies might be necessary.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nI\u2019m confident in the answer. By exploring multiple strategies, checking calculations, and ensuring both methods aligned, I\u2019ve validated that the \\(y\\)-intercept of the line \\(x - 2y = 5\\) is indeed \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\).\n\n### **Extra Step: Quick Check**\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me quickly check:\n\n- **Original equation:** \\(x - 2y = 5\\)\n  \n- **Substituting \\(x = 0\\):** \n  \\[\n  0 - 2y = 5 \\implies -2y = 5 \\implies y = -\\frac{5}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Is this consistent with the slope-intercept form?**: Yes, \\(y = -\\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{x}{2}\\) confirms the same \\(y\\)-intercept.\n\nEverything checks out. The \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\).",
