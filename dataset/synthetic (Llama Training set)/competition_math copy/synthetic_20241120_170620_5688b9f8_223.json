    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and checking our work as we go along. I'll make sure to think out loud, explore various approaches, and adjust my thinking if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I notice it's about finding the largest interior angle of a triangle with given measures: \\(50^\\circ\\), \\(55^\\circ\\), and \\(x^\\circ\\). \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Sum of Angles in a Triangle:** I remember that the sum of all interior angles in a triangle must be \\(180^\\circ\\). So, I can use that to find \\(x\\).\n- **Comparison of Angles:** After finding \\(x\\), I can compare all three angles to determine which is the largest.\n- **Alternate Methods:** Maybe there's a way to visualize or use properties of triangles, but for now, the sum of angles seems straightforward.\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards using the sum of angles method because it directly relates to finding \\(x\\). But let's explore this further to ensure it's the best approach.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Sum of Angles Method:**\n   - Calculate \\(x\\) using \\(50^\\circ + 55^\\circ + x^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\).\n   \n2. **Visual Approach:**\n   - Draw the triangle (if possible) to visually inspect the largest angle.\n\n3. **Use of Triangle Properties:**\n   - Recall that in a triangle, the side opposite the largest angle is the longest.\n\n**Reflection:** \n- The sum of angles method is mathematical and precise. The visual approach might help but isn't always accurate without actual measurements. Triangle properties could reinforce our findings.\n\nI'm convinced that starting with the sum of angles is the most direct and reliable method.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating \\(x\\) Using the Sum of Angles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to find \\(x\\) such that the total of all three angles equals \\(180^\\circ\\).\n- This is a straightforward calculation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n50^\\circ + 55^\\circ + x^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\\[\n105^\\circ + x^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\\[\nx^\\circ = 180^\\circ - 105^\\circ = 75^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\(50^\\circ + 55^\\circ + 75^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\)? Yes, it does.\n- **Reflection:** This seems correct. \\(75^\\circ\\) fits well within the range needed to complete \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Largest Angle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now that I have all three angles: \\(50^\\circ\\), \\(55^\\circ\\), and \\(75^\\circ\\), it's clear that \\(75^\\circ\\) is the largest.\n- But to be thorough, I should compare all angles to be certain.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- \\(50^\\circ < 55^\\circ < 75^\\circ\\)\n- **Largest Angle:** \\(75^\\circ\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The comparison confirms that \\(75^\\circ\\) is indeed the largest.\n- No additional methods are needed here since the calculation was straightforward.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does the sum of angles equal \\(180^\\circ\\)?** Yes: \\(50^\\circ + 55^\\circ + 75^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\).\n- **Is \\(75^\\circ\\) the largest among the three?** Yes, it's greater than both \\(50^\\circ\\) and \\(55^\\circ\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Everything checks out. The method used was appropriate, and the calculations are correct.\n- There's no need to explore other strategies or methods at this point.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe degree measure of the largest interior angle of this triangle is **\\(75^\\circ\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Did the initial strategy work?** Yes, using the sum of angles was effective in finding \\(x\\).\n- **Was there any confusion?** Not really, but it was helpful to check each step to ensure accuracy.\n- **Could there be a simpler method?** While the sum of angles was straightforward, considering triangle properties reinforced the finding. However, for this problem, the sum of angles was sufficient.\n\nOverall, this approach feels correct, and the checks confirm the solution. It's always good to reflect and ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one, which helps in catching any potential errors early on.",

  "ground_truth": "We know that the interior angles of a triangle sum to $180^\\circ$, so $50^\\circ + 55^\\circ + x^\\circ = 180^\\circ$. It follows that $x = 75$. Thus, this triangle has angles of $50^\\circ$, $55^\\circ$, and $75^\\circ$. The largest of these three angles is $\\boxed{75^\\circ}$."
