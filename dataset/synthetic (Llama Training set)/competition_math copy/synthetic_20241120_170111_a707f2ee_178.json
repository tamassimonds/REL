I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, checking my work, and making adjustments as needed\u2014just like a human would tackle a real math problem. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is finding the **units digit of \\( n \\)** given that \\( mn = 21^6 \\) and \\( m \\) has a **units digit of 7**.\n\n- **Initial Reaction**: Hmm, this reminds me of problems involving modular arithmetic, especially dealing with units digits. I\u2019ve had to find units digits before by looking at patterns or cycles in powers of numbers.\n  \n- **Brainstorming**: Maybe I can:\n    - **Use Modular Arithmetic**: Since we're dealing with units digits, mod 10 might be helpful.\n    - **Find Patterns in Powers of 21**: Perhaps \\( 21^6 \\) has a repeating pattern in its units digit.\n    - **Break Down the Problem**: Look at how \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) relate to \\( 21^6 \\) and see if I can isolate \\( n \\).\n\n- **Uncertainty**: I'm not entirely sure which approach will be the most straightforward. Maybe starting with modular arithmetic since it's directly related to units digits.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Modular Arithmetic**\n\n**Step 1**: **Determine the Units Digit of \\( 21^6 \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process**: Since we're looking for the units digit, let's find \\( 21^6 \\mod 10 \\). The units digit is the remainder when divided by 10.\n\n- **Calculation**:\n    - Observe that \\( 21 \\equiv 1 \\mod 10 \\) because the **units digit of 21 is 1**.\n    - Therefore, \\( 21^6 \\equiv 1^6 \\mod 10 \\).\n    - **Result**: \\( 21^6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 10 \\).\n\n- **Reflection**: Wait, that seems too easy. But, since the units digit of \\( 21 \\) is **1**, raising it to any power will still have a units digit of **1**. Okay, that makes sense.\n\n**Step 2**: **Express \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) in Terms of Modular Arithmetic**\n\n- **Given**: \\( mn = 21^6 \\) and the units digit of \\( m \\) is 7.\n- **So**, \\( m \\equiv 7 \\mod 10 \\).\n\n- **Thought Process**: To find the units digit of \\( n \\), I need to solve \\( n \\equiv \\frac{21^6}{m} \\mod 10 \\). But division in modular arithmetic isn't straightforward. I need to think differently.\n\n- **Realization**: Wait, instead of dividing, maybe I can use the properties of modular arithmetic to find \\( n \\) directly.\n\n**Step 3**: **Rearrange the Equation**\n\n- **Idea**: Since \\( mn \\equiv 1 \\mod 10 \\) (because \\( 21^6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 10 \\)), I can express \\( n \\) in terms of \\( m \\):\n    \\[\n    n \\equiv 21^6 \\times m^{-1} \\mod 10\n    \\]\n  \n- **But**: I need to find \\( m^{-1} \\mod 10 \\), the multiplicative inverse of \\( m \\) modulo 10.\n\n**Step 4**: **Find the Multiplicative Inverse of \\( m \\) Modulo 10**\n\n- **Given**: \\( m \\equiv 7 \\mod 10 \\)\n- **Objective**: Find \\( x \\) such that \\( 7x \\equiv 1 \\mod 10 \\)\n\n- **Thought Process**:\n    - I can use the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** or simply test multiples of 7 modulo 10.\n\n- **Calculation**:\n    - Testing:\n        - \\( 7 \\times 1 = 7 \\equiv 7 \\mod 10 \\)\n        - \\( 7 \\times 2 = 14 \\equiv 4 \\mod 10 \\)\n        - \\( 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\equiv 1 \\mod 10 \\)\n\n    - **Result**: \\( 7 \\times 3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 10 \\), so \\( m^{-1} \\equiv 3 \\mod 10 \\).\n\n- **Reflection**: That works! So, the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 10 is 3.\n\n**Step 5**: **Calculate \\( n \\mod 10 \\)**\n\n- **Now**, using \\( n \\equiv 21^6 \\times m^{-1} \\mod 10 \\):\n    \\[\n    n \\equiv 1 \\times 3 \\equiv 3 \\mod 10\n    \\]\n\n- **Meaning**: The units digit of \\( n \\) is **3**.\n\n- **Check**: Does this make sense?\n    - **Quick Check**: If \\( mn \\equiv 1 \\mod 10 \\) and \\( m \\equiv 7 \\mod 10 \\), then \\( n \\) must be such that \\( 7n \\equiv 1 \\mod 10 \\). We've already established that \\( n \\equiv 3 \\mod 10 \\), since \\( 7 \\times 3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 10 \\). So, it checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n- **Alternative Idea**: **Verify by Multiplying \\( m \\) and \\( n \\)**:\n    - Let\u2019s see if \\( m \\times n \\) indeed gives a units digit of 1.\n\n- **Calculation**:\n    - \\( m = 7 \\)\n    - \\( n = 3 \\)\n    - \\( mn = 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\)\n    - **Units Digit**: \\( 21 \\mod 10 = 1 \\)\n\n- **Reflection**: This confirms our earlier result. The units digit of \\( n \\) being **3** is correct.\n\n- **Another Approach**: **Pattern Recognition in Units Digits**:\n    - Perhaps analyzing patterns in powers of numbers ending in 7 could give insights. However, since we already efficiently found \\( n \\) using modular arithmetic, this seems unnecessary. Still, it's good to keep in mind for similar problems.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Does the answer make sense?**\n    - Everything aligns: \\( m \\equiv 7 \\mod 10 \\), \\( n \\equiv 3 \\mod 10 \\), and \\( mn \\equiv 1 \\mod 10 \\).\n    - The units digit of \\( n \\) being **3** is consistent with all calculations.\n\n- **Is there any ambiguity?**\n    - No, the problem specifies the units digit of \\( m \\) as 7, and we've explicitly calculated \\( n \\mod 10 \\).\n\n- **Could there be multiple solutions?**\n    - In modular arithmetic, solutions can repeat every multiple of the modulus. However, since we're only interested in the units digit, and we've accounted for the multiplicative inverse, \\( n \\equiv 3 \\mod 10 \\) is unique in this context.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and reflecting on each step, the **units digit of \\( n \\) is **3**. The approach using modular arithmetic was straightforward and efficient, verifying through multiple checks ensured the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed walkthrough mirrors how a human would naturally think through and solve the problem, complete with brainstorming, exploring various strategies, checking work, and adjusting approaches as needed.",
