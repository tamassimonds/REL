    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it just like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting frequently, and checking my work along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question about quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\), several things come to mind:\n\n1. **Given Measurements:** \n   - \\( \\overline{AB} = \\overline{BC} = 10 \\)\n   - \\( \\overline{CD} = \\overline{DA} = 17 \\)\n   - \\( \\angle ADC = 60^\\circ \\)\n\n2. **Unknown:** \n   - Length of diagonal \\( \\overline{AC} \\)\n\n3. **Visual Representation:** \n   - A quadrilateral with two pairs of equal sides.\n   - An angle of \\(60^\\circ\\) between sides of different lengths.\n\nHmm, at first glance, this looks a bit like a **kite** or maybe a **rhombus**, but I notice that the side lengths don't quite match the properties of those shapes. A rhombus has all sides equal, and a kite has only one pair of unequal sides equal. So, it's neither, but perhaps it has some properties akin to these shapes.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n- **Law of Cosines:** This could help relate the sides and angles to find the missing diagonal.\n- **Coordinate Geometry:** Assigning coordinates to the points might simplify calculations.\n- **Construction of Triangles:** Breaking the quadrilateral into triangles and analyzing them individually.\n\nI'll start by attempting the **Law of Cosines**, as it directly relates sides and angles, which seems fitting here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Law of Cosines**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe Law of Cosines relates the lengths of sides in a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. I see that \\( \\angle ADC = 60^\\circ \\), so perhaps I can apply this to triangle \\(ADC\\).\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n\\overline{AC}^2 = \\overline{AD}^2 + \\overline{CD}^2 - 2 \\cdot \\overline{AD} \\cdot \\overline{CD} \\cdot \\cos(\\angle ADC)\n\\]\n\n**Known Values:**\n- \\( \\overline{AD} = 17 \\)\n- \\( \\overline{CD} = 17 \\)\n- \\( \\angle ADC = 60^\\circ \\)\n- \\( \\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\overline{AC}^2 = 17^2 + 17^2 - 2 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 17 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\overline{AC}^2 = 289 + 289 - 289\n\\]\n\\[\n\\overline{AC}^2 = 289\n\\]\n\\[\n\\overline{AC} = \\sqrt{289} = 17\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait a minute... the length of diagonal \\( \\overline{AC} \\) is 17? That\u2019s the same as \\( \\overline{CD} \\) and \\( \\overline{DA} \\). This seems a bit off because having a diagonal equal to a side in this setup is unusual.\n\n**Check:**\nLet me quickly verify the calculation.\n\n- \\(17^2 = 289\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 17 \\times 17 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 289\\)\n- So, \\(289 + 289 - 289 = 289\\) is correct.\n\nBut, if \\( \\overline{AC} = 17 \\), then triangle \\(ABC\\) must also satisfy this, having \\( \\overline{AC} = 17 \\) and both \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and \\( \\overline{BC} \\) equal to 10. That seems plausible, but I\u2019m not entirely comfortable with it yet.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Another Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nMaybe relying solely on the Law of Cosines isn't enough. Perhaps I should cross-verify using another method to ensure the result makes sense.\n\nLet\u2019s consider **coordinate geometry**. By assigning specific coordinates to points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\), I can calculate the length of \\( \\overline{AC} \\) directly.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Place point \\(C\\) at the origin, \\(C = (0,0)\\).\n- Since \\( \\overline{CD} = 17 \\), place \\(D\\) at \\( (17,0) \\).\n- \\( \\angle ADC = 60^\\circ\\), so rotate point \\(A\\) around \\(D\\) by \\(60^\\circ\\).\n- \\( \\overline{DA} = 17\\), so point \\(A\\) will be at \\( (17 + 17 \\cdot \\cos(60^\\circ), 17 \\cdot \\sin(60^\\circ)) \\).\n- \\( \\overline{AB} = 10\\), so place \\(B\\) at \\( (x, y) \\) such that the distance from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is 10 and from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) is 10.\n\n**Calculation:**\nLet's calculate the coordinates step by step.\n\n1. **Coordinates of \\(A\\):**\n   \\[\n   A = \\left(17 + 17 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}, 17 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\left(17 + 8.5, 8.5\\sqrt{3}\\right) = (25.5, 14.5\\sqrt{3})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Coordinates of \\(B\\):**\n   Let\u2019s assume \\(B = (x, y)\\).\n   \n   - Distance from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{(x - 25.5)^2 + (y - 14.5\\sqrt{3})^2} = 10\n     \\]\n     \n   - Distance from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 10\n     \\]\n\n   Now we have two equations:\n   \n   1. \\( (x - 25.5)^2 + (y - 14.5\\sqrt{3})^2 = 100 \\)\n   2. \\( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \\)\n   \n   This system seems a bit cumbersome, but let's see if a solution exists.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis system appears solvable, but it's getting messy. Perhaps my initial approach using the Law of Cosines was correct after all, and this coordinate method is just complicating things unnecessarily.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Original Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure accuracy, I'll revisit the Law of Cosines calculation and see if the result aligns with other properties of the quadrilateral.\n\n**Check:**\nIf \\( \\overline{AC} = 17 \\), then in triangle \\(ABC\\), we have:\n- \\( \\overline{AB} = \\overline{BC} = 10 \\)\n- \\( \\overline{AC} = 17 \\)\n\nThis suggests that triangle \\(ABC\\) can exist with these side lengths. Let\u2019s briefly check if it satisfies the triangle inequality:\n\n1. \\( 10 + 10 > 17 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n2. \\( 10 + 17 > 10 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n3. \\( 17 + 10 > 10 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll inequalities hold, so triangle \\(ABC\\) is valid.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter checking, it seems that the original calculation using the Law of Cosines was indeed correct. The length of diagonal \\( \\overline{AC} \\) is **17**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThroughout this problem, starting with the Law of Cosines helped initiate a solution, but exploring a second method (coordinate geometry) revealed the complexity of the situation, prompting a reassessment. Verifying the original approach ensured the accuracy of the result. Reflecting often and checking each step confirmed that the length of diagonal \\( \\overline{AC} \\) is **17**.",
