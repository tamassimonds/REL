    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem, reflecting and brainstorming at each step, just like a human would approach it. Think of me as your study partner, exploring different strategies, checking if they're correct, and adjusting as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem **\"The domain of the function \\( q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 \\) is \\( [0,\\infty) \\). What is the range?\"**, I think:\n\n- **Recognizing Function Type:** This looks like a polynomial function, specifically a quartic (fourth-degree) polynomial. Quartics can behave in interesting ways, so maybe I need to analyze its structure.\n\n- **Recalling Similar Problems:** I remember dealing with quadratic functions and how completing the square helped in finding their ranges. Maybe a similar strategy could work here.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:** I consider different methods:\n  1. **Finding Critical Points:** Calculate the derivative to find where the function has maxima or minima.\n  2. **Completing the Square:** Try to rewrite the function in a form that reveals its minimum or maximum value.\n  3. **Graphing:** Visualizing the function could help, but I might not have graphing tools handy.\n  4. **Substituting Values:** Plugging in different \\( x \\) values within the domain to see the corresponding \\( q(x) \\).\n\n- **Uncertainty:** At this point, I\u2019m not completely sure which method is best. Maybe starting with completing the square would be a good idea, given its success with quadratics.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Complete the Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s try completing the square. This worked well for quadratics, so maybe it can help here too.\n\n**Action:**\nTry to rewrite \\( q(x) \\) in a form that highlights its vertex.\n\n\\[ \nq(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 \n\\]\n\n**Brainstorming:**\nWait, completing the square typically works for \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) forms. Since this is \\( x^4 \\), maybe I need to rearrange it somehow.\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, I notice that \\( x^4 \\) can be factored or regrouped. Let\u2019s see if that helps.\n\n**New Approach:**\nLet\u2019s consider \\( x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 \\) as a quadratic in terms of \\( x^2 \\).\n\nLet:\n\n\\[ \ny = x^2 \n\\]\n\nSo the function becomes:\n\n\\[ \nq(y) = y^2 + 4y + 4 \n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\nNow, this looks like a standard quadratic equation. I know completing the square works well here.\n\n**Action:**\nComplete the square for \\( q(y) \\):\n\n\\[\nq(y) = (y + 2)^2 \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait, does this look right? \\( (y + 2)^2 = y^2 + 4y + 4 \\), so it matches!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis transformation seems correct. Now, substituting back \\( y = x^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nq(x) = (x^2 + 2)^2 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis form is neat! It shows that \\( q(x) \\) is a square of \\( (x^2 + 2) \\). I think this will help in determining the range.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing the Transformed Function**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that we have \\( q(x) = (x^2 + 2)^2 \\), let\u2019s analyze it. Since squaring a number always gives a non-negative result, this should help in finding the range.\n\n**Action:**\nDetermine the minimum value of \\( x^2 + 2 \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 + 2 \\geq 2 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, since \\( x^2 \\geq 0 \\), adding 2 shifts the minimum value to 2. That makes sense!\n\n**Check:**\nSo, the smallest value \\( x^2 + 2 \\) can take is 2. Squaring this gives:\n\n\\[\n(q(x))_{\\text{min}} = 2^2 = 4 \n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe minimum value of \\( q(x) \\) is 4. Since \\( (x^2 + 2)^2 \\) can only increase from there, the range should be \\( [4, \\infty) \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\nThis feels intuitive because squaring always yields non-negative results, and adding 2 ensures that even the smallest \\( x \\) in the domain produces a \\( q(x) \\) value of at least 4.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution with Different Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI want to ensure that the range is indeed \\( [4, \\infty) \\). Let\u2019s test another method to confirm.\n\n**Method: Finding Critical Points**\n\n**Action:**\nCalculate the derivative \\( q'(x) \\) to find critical points:\n\n\\[\nq(x) = (x^2 + 2)^2 \n\\]\n\nUsing the chain rule:\n\n\\[\nq'(x) = 2(x^2 + 2)(2x) = 4x(x^2 + 2) \n\\]\n\nSet \\( q'(x) = 0 \\) to find critical points:\n\n\\[\n4x(x^2 + 2) = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n\\[\nx = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x^2 + 2 = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, \\( x^2 + 2 = 0 \\) has no real solutions (since \\( x^2 \\geq 0 \\)). So, the only critical point is \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n**Action:**\nEvaluate \\( q(0) \\):\n\n\\[\nq(0) = (0^2 + 2)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nThis confirms our earlier conclusion that the minimum value is 4.\n\n**Thoughts:**\nBoth methods point to the minimum being 4, which strengthens the validity of our range.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe range of \\( q(x) \\) is indeed \\( [4, \\infty) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nHaving verified using two different approaches\u2014completing the square and analyzing critical points\u2014I\u2019m confident that the range is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let's quickly check if there\u2019s any possibility of \\( q(x) \\) taking values less than 4.\n\n**Action:**\nRecall that \\( (x^2 + 2)^2 \\) is always greater than or equal to 4 because:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + 2) \\geq 2 \\Rightarrow (x^2 + 2)^2 \\geq 4 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis reinforces that 4 is indeed the minimum value.\n\n**Check:**\nAlso, since the function is a square, it can\u2019t go below this minimum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe range is correctly identified as \\( [4, \\infty) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying with multiple methods, and ensuring all checks align, the **range of the function \\( q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 \\) is \\( [4, \\infty) \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Approach**\n\n1. **Brainstorming:** Started by identifying the function type and considering various methods to find the range.\n\n2. **Completing the Square:** Attempted to rewrite the function to identify its minimum value.\n\n3. **Analyzing Transformed Function:** Determined that the minimum value is 4, leading to the range being \\( [4, \\infty) \\).\n\n4. **Verifying with Critical Points:** Confirmed that the only critical point gives a minimum value of 4.\n\n5. **Final Check:** Ensured no lower values are possible, solidifying the range.\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected on each step, made adjustments when necessary, and verified the solution to ensure accuracy.",
