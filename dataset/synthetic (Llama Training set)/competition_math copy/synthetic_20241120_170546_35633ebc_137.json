    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where it takes me. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, and reflect often to make sure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem:\n\n**User's Query:** If two numbers are randomly chosen without replacement from \\( \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\), what is the probability that their product will be a multiple of 9? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n**Immediate Reactions:**\n\n- **Multiples of 9:** I remember that a number is a multiple of 9 if it's divisible by \\(3^2\\). So, the product of the two numbers needs to have at least two 3s in its prime factorization.\n- **Sample Space:** We'll be picking two numbers from \\( \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\), but the selection is without replacement. This makes me think about combinations rather than permutations.\n- **Possible Strategies:** Maybe I can list all possible products and see which ones are multiples of 9, or perhaps there's a quicker way by looking at the factors of each number.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Listing Combinations:** One way is to list all pairs and check their products.\n- **Prime Factorization:** Another approach is to look at the prime factors of each number to see which combinations yield multiple 3s.\n- **Using Probability Rules:** I could also consider probability rules related to multiples and factors.\n\nI'm leaning towards **listing combinations** to get a clear picture, but I'll keep **prime factorization** in mind as a possibly more efficient method.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: List All Possible Combinations**\n\nLet's start by listing all possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen from \\( \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\) without replacement.\n\n**Total Number of Pairs:**\n\nSince we're choosing 2 numbers out of 4, the total number of combinations is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Possible Combinations:**\n\n1. (3, 4)\n2. (3, 5)\n3. (3, 6)\n4. (4, 5)\n5. (4, 6)\n6. (5, 6)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, there are 6 possible pairs. That seems straightforward. Now, I'll calculate the product of each pair to see which ones are multiples of 9.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Calculate the Products**\n\nLet's compute the product for each pair:\n\n1. \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n2. \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n3. \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n4. \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\)\n5. \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\)\n6. \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAmong these products, only \\(18\\) is a multiple of 9. Wait, let me double-check:\n\n- \\(18 = 2 \\times 3^2\\), so it has \\(3^2\\) in its prime factorization. \u2705\n- All other products do not have \\(3^2\\). For example, \\(12 = 3 \\times 4\\) only has one 3, so it's not a multiple of 9.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 2:**\n\nOnly the pair \\( (3, 6) \\) produces a product that is a multiple of 9.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Determine the Probability**\n\nNow that I know only one out of the six possible pairs results in a product that's a multiple of 9, let's calculate the probability.\n\n**Probability Formula:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\). That makes sense because only one pair out of six meets the multiple of 9 condition. But let me double-check to be sure:\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Maybe I should consider the prime factorization angle to confirm. If I think about it, for the product to be a multiple of 9, at least one of the selected numbers should contribute two 3s. Looking at the numbers:\n  - \\(3\\) has one 3.\n  - \\(6\\) has one 3 and one 2.\n  - \\(4\\) and \\(5\\) don't have any 3s.\n\nFrom this, it looks like pairing \\(3\\) with \\(6\\) is indeed the only combination that satisfies the condition.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes it match our earlier finding? Yes, both approaches lead to the same conclusion.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n- **Total Combinations:** 6\n- **Favorable Outcome:** 1 pair \\((3, 6)\\)\n- **Probability:** \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n\nEverything checks out. The probability that the product of the two randomly chosen numbers is a multiple of 9 is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Started by considering different strategies like listing combinations and prime factorization.\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Initially thought listing might be tedious but proceeded with it to ensure clarity.\n- **Checking Along the Way:** After calculating products, confirmed that only one pair meets the condition.\n- **Alternative Confirmation:** Used prime factorization to verify the result matches with different reasoning.\n- **Final Verification:** Recalculated and reflected multiple times to ensure the probability is accurate.\n\nThis approach, with its checks and reflections, ensured that the solution is both correct and comprehensible.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen. None of these numbers are multiples of 9, so in order for their product to be a multiple of 9, both numbers must be a multiple of 3. The only possible pair that satisfies this is 3 and 6. Thus, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$"
