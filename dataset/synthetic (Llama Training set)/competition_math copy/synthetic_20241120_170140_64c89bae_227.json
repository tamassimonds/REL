I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's start by really understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Question:** One digit of the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\) is randomly selected. What is the probability that the digit is a 4? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n---\n\nWhen I first see this problem, a few thoughts pop into my head:\n\n1. **Decimal Representation:** I remember that \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\) is a repeating decimal. Maybe I need to find its decimal form.\n\n2. **Probability of Selecting a Digit:** This makes me think about the digits in the decimal expansion. I need to figure out how often the digit 4 appears.\n\n3. **Common Fraction:** The answer needs to be a fraction, so I should ensure my final answer is simplified accordingly.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Convert \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\) into its decimal form by performing long division. Then, look at the repeating sequence to determine the probability of picking a 4.\n\n- **Strategy 2:** Consider the infinite nature of the decimal and perhaps use probability concepts related to repeating decimals.\n\n- **Strategy 3:** Think about whether there's a pattern or shortcut I can use instead of calculating the entire decimal.\n\nI'm leaning towards **Strategy 1** because converting \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\) into a decimal seems straightforward. But I'll keep **Strategy 2** in mind in case I run into issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Converting \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\) to a Decimal**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nOkay, let's start by converting \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\) into its decimal form. I know from previous problems that this involves long division.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Divide 5 by 7.\n  \n  - 5.000000 \u00f7 7\n  - 7 goes into 50 seven times (7 \u00d7 7 = 49), leaving a remainder of 1.\n  - Bring down the next 0 (10).\n  - 7 goes into 10 once (7 \u00d7 1 = 7), remainder 3.\n  - Bring down the next 0 (30).\n  - 7 goes into 30 four times (7 \u00d7 4 = 28), remainder 2.\n  - Bring down the next 0 (20).\n  - 7 goes into 20 two times (7 \u00d7 2 = 14), remainder 6.\n  - Bring down the next 0 (60).\n  - 7 goes into 60 eight times (7 \u00d7 8 = 56), remainder 4.\n  - Bring down the next 0 (40).\n  - 7 goes into 40 five times (7 \u00d7 5 = 35), remainder 5.\n  - Bring down the next 0 (50), and the cycle repeats.\n\n**Result:**\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{5}{7} = 0.\\overline{714285}\\).\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that's interesting. I see that the decimal repeats with the sequence \"714285.\" This confirms my recollection that \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\) is a repeating decimal. It also tells me that the length of the repeating block is 6 digits.\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**\n\nYes, it aligns with what I know about \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\). The repeating part is \\(714285\\), and the decimal starts with \\(0.714285714285...\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing the Repeating Sequence**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the decimal representation, I need to focus on the repeating sequence: \"714285.\" I need to determine the probability of randomly selecting a digit from this sequence and it being 4.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Count the number of times 4 appears in the repeating block and divide by the total number of digits in the block.\n\n- **Strategy 2:** Consider if the digit 4 appears in multiple cycles, but since we're selecting one digit randomly from the entire repeating decimal, focusing on one block should suffice.\n\n- **Strategy 3:** Think about whether the position of the digit affects the probability, but since each digit has an equal chance of being selected, it shouldn't matter.\n\n**Proceeding with Strategy 1:**\n\nGiven that the repeating block is 6 digits long, I'll count how many times 4 appears.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- The repeating block: **714285**\n- Count of digit '4': **1 time**\n\n**Probability Calculation:**\n\nProbability \\(P\\) of selecting a 4:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Number of times 4 appears}}{\\text{Total number of digits in the block}} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. The digit 4 appears once in a 6-digit block, so the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\nLet me quickly verify if my counting is correct. The block is **714285**, and I see 4 only once. The total number of digits is indeed 6.\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**\n\nYes, it does. The probability reflects the ratio of 4s to the total digits in the repeating sequence.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering the Infinite Decimal**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that a digit is randomly selected from the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\). Since the decimal is infinite, does this affect the probability?\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Realize that even though the decimal is infinite, each digit's position has an equal chance of being selected.\n\n- **Strategy 2:** Think about whether the repeating nature impacts the probability calculation. Maybe I don't need to consider multiple cycles since the repeating block covers all possible positions.\n\n- **Strategy 3:** Consider if the position affects the probability, but it seems like every digit, regardless of its position, has an equal likelihood of being selected.\n\n**Reflecting on Strategy 1:**\n\nI remember that for repeating decimals, each block's digits are uniformly distributed across the infinite sequence. So, focusing on one block is sufficient.\n\n**Confirming the Approach:**\n\nThe probability of selecting a specific digit in an infinite repeating decimal is indeed determined by the proportion of that digit within one full cycle of the repetition.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Finalizing the Probability**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven that the repeating block is \"714285\" and the digit 4 appears once:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis probability makes sense because it aligns with the ratio of 4s to total digits in the repeating sequence.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- Repeating block: **714285**\n- Count of 4s: **1**\n- Total digits: **6**\n- Probability: \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)\n\nEverything checks out. The approach is correct, and the probability is correctly calculated.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nIn tackling this problem:\n\n1. **Converting the Fraction:** Starting with converting \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\) into its decimal form was essential to identifying the repeating sequence.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Repeating Block:** By focusing on one full cycle of the repeating decimal, I could accurately determine the probability of selecting a 4.\n\n3. **Confirming Uniform Distribution:** Recognizing that each digit position in the infinite decimal has an equal chance ensured that a single block's proportions were sufficient.\n\nThroughout the process, reflecting and checking each step helped ensure the accuracy of the final probability.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Be sure to check**\n\n- **Is the repeating block accurately identified?**\n  \n  Yes, \\(714285\\) is correct.\n\n- **Is the count of 4s within the block accurate?**\n  \n  Yes, there is one 4.\n\n- **Is the total number of digits in the block correct?**\n  \n  Yes, six digits.\n\n- **Does the infinite nature of the decimal affect the probability?**\n  \n  No, each position is equally likely.\n\nEverything aligns, confirming that the probability of randomly selecting a 4 from the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\) is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).",
