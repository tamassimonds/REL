    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and be open to adjusting my approach as needed. Let's see where this takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first look at the equation:\n\n\\[\n22^2 \\times 55^2 = 10^2 \\times N^2\n\\]\n\nI think, \"Hmm, this looks like a relationship between squares of numbers.\" At first glance, it reminds me of properties related to exponents and possibly the Pythagorean theorem, but I'm not entirely sure. \n\nMy initial reaction is to maybe expand the squares and see if that leads anywhere, but I'm wondering if there's a more straightforward path. Another thought is to recognize patterns or see if both sides can be simplified similarly. \n\nLet me jot down what comes to mind:\n\n1. **Expanding Both Sides:** Maybe expand \\(22^2\\) and \\(55^2\\) to see the total on the left.\n   \n2. **Prime Factorization:** Break down each number into its prime factors to see if that reveals a pattern.\n\n3. **Properties of Exponents:** Use rules of exponents to simplify the equation.\n\n4. **Taking Square Roots:** Perhaps taking the square root of both sides could simplify things, but that might complicate isolating \\(N\\).\n\n5. **Cross Multiplying:** Since it's an equation involving multiplication of squares, maybe cross multiplying could help, but I need to think if that's applicable here.\n\nLet me start by exploring these strategies one by one, starting with expanding both sides.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expanding Both Sides**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s try expanding \\(22^2\\) and \\(55^2\\) to see the total on the left side. This might give me a clearer picture of the equation.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n22^2 = 484\n\\]\n\n\\[\n55^2 = 3025\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply these two results:\n\n\\[\n484 \\times 3025\n\\]\n\nWait, calculating \\(484 \\times 3025\\) directly seems a bit cumbersome. Maybe multiplying in parts would help:\n\n\\[\n484 \\times 3025 = 484 \\times (3000 + 25) = 484 \\times 3000 + 484 \\times 25\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n\\[\n484 \\times 3000 = 1,452,000\n\\]\n\\[\n484 \\times 25 = 12,100\n\\]\n\\[\n1,452,000 + 12,100 = 1,464,100\n\\]\n\nSo, the left side simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n22^2 \\times 55^2 = 1,464,100\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems like a huge number, but at least I've got a concrete value. However, the right side also involves \\(N^2\\), so comparing directly isn't straightforward yet. Maybe it's better to simplify using exponents or prime factorization to find \\(N\\) directly.\n\n**Decision:** \n\nSince expanding led to a large number, which might complicate things, let\u2019s pivot and try using prime factorization instead. Perhaps that will reveal a simpler relationship.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Prime Factorization of Both Sides**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s break down each number into its prime factors. Maybe this will show a direct relationship between the primes, making it easier to solve for \\(N\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n**Left Side:**\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 22^2 = (2 \\times 11)^2 = 2^2 \\times 11^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n55 = 5 \\times 11 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 55^2 = (5 \\times 11)^2 = 5^2 \\times 11^2\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply these:\n\n\\[\n22^2 \\times 55^2 = (2^2 \\times 11^2) \\times (5^2 \\times 11^2) = 2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 11^4\n\\]\n\n**Right Side:**\n\n\\[\n10 = 2 \\times 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 10^2 = (2 \\times 5)^2 = 2^2 \\times 5^2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n10^2 \\times N^2 = 2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times N^2\n\\]\n\n**Equation After Prime Factorization:**\n\n\\[\n2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 11^4 = 2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times N^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute! I see that both sides have \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\). This means those factors cancel out, leaving only \\(11^4\\) on the left side. So, it simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n11^4 = N^2\n\\]\n\nThis is much simpler! It seems like prime factorization was a good move here.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nNow, to find \\(N\\), I can take the square root of both sides. Let\u2019s proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\(N\\) by Taking Square Roots**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince we\u2019ve simplified the equation to \\(11^4 = N^2\\), taking the square root should give me \\(N\\). But I need to ensure I handle the exponents correctly.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{11^4} = 11^{4/2} = 11^2 = 121\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nN = 121\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat makes sense! Taking the square root of \\(11^4\\) simplifies neatly to \\(11^2\\), which is \\(121\\). This feels right because all our earlier steps aligned correctly.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI think this is the correct solution. However, to be absolutely sure, let\u2019s check by plugging \\(N = 121\\) back into the original equation and see if both sides are equal.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution by Substitution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, it\u2019s always good to verify by substituting the value back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n22^2 \\times 55^2 = 10^2 \\times N^2\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\(N = 121\\) into the right side:\n\n\\[\n10^2 \\times 121^2 = 100 \\times 14,641 = 1,464,100\n\\]\n\nNow, compare this with our earlier calculation of the left side:\n\n\\[\n22^2 \\times 55^2 = 1,464,100\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth sides are equal! This confirms that \\(N = 121\\) is indeed the correct solution. \n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe prime factorization approach helped simplify the problem significantly, making it easier to solve for \\(N\\). By verifying the solution, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and reflecting on each step, the positive integer \\(N\\) that satisfies the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{121}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, checking, and verifying ensured that we arrived at the correct solution. It\u2019s essential to remain flexible and ready to change strategies when the initial approach doesn\u2019t seem to be working, just like a human would naturally think through a problem.",
