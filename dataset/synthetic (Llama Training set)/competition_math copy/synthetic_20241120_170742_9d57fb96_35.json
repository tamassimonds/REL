    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Just as I would approach it when tackling a question for the first time, I'll brainstorm, reflect, and adjust my strategies as needed. It's important to think out loud, explore various methods, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right path.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see the function \\( f(x) = \\sin^4 x + \\cos^2 x \\), my initial reaction is to consider the properties of sine and cosine functions. I've dealt with trigonometric identities before, so that might be a good starting point. \n\n- **Brainstorming Options:**\n  - **Use Trigonometric Identities:** Maybe rewrite \\(\\sin^4 x\\) in terms of \\(\\cos^2 x\\) using the Pythagorean identity.\n  - **Consider Extreme Values:** Since sine and cosine are bounded between -1 and 1, perhaps evaluating the function at key angles could help.\n  - **Graphing the Function:** Visualizing might give insights into the range.\n\nBut then I remember that dealing with powers like \\(\\sin^4 x\\) can complicate things. Maybe starting with identities is cleaner. Let\u2019s explore that first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Trigonometric Identities**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI know that \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\). This fundamental identity could help relate \\(\\sin^4 x\\) and \\(\\cos^2 x\\). If I express \\(\\sin^4 x\\) in terms of \\(\\cos^2 x\\), it might simplify \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\\[\n\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^4 x = (\\sin^2 x)^2 = (1 - \\cos^2 x)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 - 2\\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Back into \\( f(x) \\):**  \n\\[\nf(x) = \\sin^4 x + \\cos^2 x = (1 - 2\\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x) + \\cos^2 x\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 - 2\\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x + \\cos^2 x\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 - \\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, now \\( f(x) = 1 - \\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x \\). This looks better because it's expressed in terms of \\(\\cos^2 x\\), which might help in analyzing its range. But I\u2019m not completely sure if this is the easiest path. Maybe substituting \\(\\cos^2 x = u\\) could make it clearer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting \\(\\cos^2 x = u\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s set \\( u = \\cos^2 x \\). Since \\(\\cos x\\) ranges from 0 to 1 for \\( x \\in [0, \\pi] \\), \\( u \\) will also range from 0 to 1. This substitution should make \\( f(x) \\) easier to handle.\n\n**Rewriting the Function:**  \n\\[\nf(x) = 1 - u + u^2\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Range of \\( u \\):**  \nSince \\( u = \\cos^2 x \\), and \\(\\cos x\\) ranges from -1 to 1, \\( u \\) only takes values from 0 to 1.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis substitution seems helpful. Now, \\( f(x) \\) is a quadratic function in terms of \\( u \\), which is easier to analyze. I think I can proceed by finding the minimum and maximum values of this quadratic within the interval \\( [0, 1] \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing the Quadratic Function \\( g(u) = 1 - u + u^2 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo find the range of \\( f(x) \\), I need to determine the minimum and maximum values of \\( g(u) = 1 - u + u^2 \\) within \\( u \\in [0, 1] \\). Quadratics can be analyzed using calculus or by completing the square. Let's try completing the square first, then verify with calculus.\n\n**Calculations - Completing the Square:**  \n\\[\ng(u) = u^2 - u + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\left( u^2 - u \\right) + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\left( u^2 - u + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) + 1 - \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\left( u - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy completing the square, I see that the minimum value occurs when \\( u = \\frac{1}{2} \\). This is a neat way to find the vertex of the quadratic, which gives the minimum since the coefficient of \\( u^2 \\) is positive (the parabola opens upwards).\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, because shifting \\( u \\) by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) completes the square, and adding \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) adjusts the constant term. The vertex form clearly shows the minimum value.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Minimum and Maximum Values**\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- **Minimum Value:**\n  \\[\n  g\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4} = 0 + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\n  \\]\n\n- **Maximum Value:**\n  To find the maximum within \\( u \\in [0, 1] \\), evaluate \\( g(u) \\) at the endpoints:\n\n  - At \\( u = 0 \\):\n    \\[\n    g(0) = 1 - 0 + 0^2 = 1\n    \\]\n\n  - At \\( u = 1 \\):\n    \\[\n    g(1) = 1 - 1 + 1^2 = 1\n    \\]\n\n  So, the maximum value is \\( 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), and the maximum is \\( 1 \\). This makes sense because the quadratic function \\( g(u) \\) is continuous and differentiable over \\( [0, 1] \\), and we\u2019ve checked both the vertex and endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Confirming the Range of \\( f(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I've identified the minimum and maximum values of \\( g(u) \\), I can conclude the range of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( \\left[ \\frac{3}{4}, 1 \\right] \\). But before finalizing, let's cross-verify using calculus to ensure there are no other extrema within the interval.\n\n**Calculations - Using Calculus:**  \n- **Find the Derivative:**\n  \\[\n  g'(u) = \\frac{d}{du}(1 - u + u^2) = -1 + 2u\n  \\]\n\n- **Set Derivative to Zero to Find Critical Points:**\n  \\[\n  -1 + 2u = 0 \\implies 2u = 1 \\implies u = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Evaluate \\( g\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\):**\n  \\[\n  g\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{3}{4}\n  \\]\n\n- **Check Second Derivative:**\n  \\[\n  g''(u) = \\frac{d}{du}(-1 + 2u) = 2\n  \\]\n  Since \\( g''(u) > 0 \\), the critical point at \\( u = \\frac{1}{2} \\) is a minimum.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe calculus approach confirms that \\( u = \\frac{1}{2} \\) gives the minimum value, and the maximum occurs at the endpoints \\( u = 0 \\) and \\( u = 1 \\). This aligns with what we found earlier.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying with calculus, and checking both the vertex and endpoints, the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sin^4 x + \\cos^2 x \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left[ \\frac{3}{4}, 1 \\right]}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \n- **Did the Initial Approach Work?** Yes, applying trigonometric identities and substituting \\(\\cos^2 x\\) helped transform the function into a quadratic form, making it easier to analyze.\n- **Was Calculus Necessary?** Initially, completing the square was sufficient, but using calculus provided an additional layer of verification, ensuring no critical points were missed.\n- **Would Graphing Help?** Graphing \\( f(x) \\) could provide a quick visual confirmation of the range, but it wasn't necessary with the analytical methods used.\n- **Any Mistakes or Adjustments Needed?** Initially hesitated whether completing the square was the best path, but it led to a clear solution. Continuous checking ensured the correctness of each step.\n\nOverall, the step-by-step approach, combined with checking and reflecting, led to a confident and accurate determination of the range.",
