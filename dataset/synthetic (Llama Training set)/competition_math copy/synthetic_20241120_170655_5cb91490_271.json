    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, thinking through different strategies and reflecting often to ensure we're on the right path. I'll brainstorm various methods, check my work frequently, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, the problem asks me to find the remainder when the product \\(3 \\times 13 \\times 23 \\times \\ldots \\times 193\\) is divided by \\(5\\). \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of modular arithmetic, where we're interested in the remainders. I have a faint memory of using properties of congruences or maybe even looking at patterns in the numbers involved.\n  \n- **Checking My Understanding:** To ensure I'm on the right track, I realize that finding the remainder when a big multiplication is divided by a small number like \\(5\\) often involves simplifying the problem using modular properties.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation Modulo \\(5\\):** \n   - **Idea:** Calculate each term in the product modulo \\(5\\) and then multiply those remainders together.\n   - **Reflection:** This could be tedious since there are multiple terms, but it might work if I look for patterns.\n\n2. **Using Patterns or Arithmetic Sequences:**\n   - **Idea:** Since the numbers increase by \\(10\\), perhaps there's a pattern or property I can exploit.\n   - **Reflection:** Maybe all terms share a common remainder when divided by \\(5\\)?\n\n3. **Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**\n   - **Idea:** Since \\(5\\) is prime, could I use CRT to simplify the calculations?\n   - **Reflection:** This might be overkill for such a straightforward problem.\n\n4. **Factoring Out Multiples of \\(5\\):**\n   - **Idea:** Check if any term in the product is a multiple of \\(5\\), which would affect the entire product's remainder.\n   - **Reflection:** If there's a multiple of \\(5\\), the entire product's remainder would be \\(0\\).\n\n**Natural Flow:** Let me start with the **Direct Calculation Modulo \\(5\\)** approach because it's straightforward and directly addresses the problem. If it becomes too cumbersome, I'll reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Attempting Direct Calculation Modulo \\(5\\)**\n\n**Approach:**\nI'll take each term in the sequence and reduce it modulo \\(5\\).\n\n- **Listing the Terms:**\n  The sequence is \\(3, 13, 23, \\ldots, 193\\), increasing by \\(10\\).\n\n- **Calculating Each Term Modulo \\(5\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  3 &\\equiv 3 \\mod 5, \\\\\n  13 &\\equiv 3 \\mod 5, \\\\\n  23 &\\equiv 3 \\mod 5, \\\\\n  & \\vdots \\\\\n  193 &\\equiv 3 \\mod 5.\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Pattern Observation:** \n  Wait a minute! All these numbers are congruent to \\(3 \\mod 5\\). \n\n**Reflection:**\nThis is interesting. It seems like every term in the product gives the same remainder when divided by \\(5\\). Let me confirm this pattern.\n\n- **Checking the Sequence:**\n  The numbers are of the form \\(3 + 10k\\), where \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer. \n  \\[\n  3 + 10k \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\quad \\text{for all integers } k.\n  \\]\n  \n**Conclusion:**\nSince all terms are congruent to \\(3 \\mod 5\\), the product's remainder will be the same as \\(3^n \\mod 5\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of terms in the product.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determining the Number of Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo proceed, I need to know how many terms are in the sequence \\(3, 13, 23, \\ldots, 193\\).\n\n- **Identifying the Sequence:**\n  This is an arithmetic sequence where:\n  - **First Term (\\(a\\))**: \\(3\\)\n  - **Common Difference (\\(d\\))**: \\(10\\)\n  - **Last Term (\\(l\\))**: \\(193\\)\n  \n- **Formula for the Number of Terms (\\(n\\)):**\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{l - a}{d} + 1 = \\frac{193 - 3}{10} + 1 = \\frac{190}{10} + 1 = 19 + 1 = 20.\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nGot it! There are \\(20\\) terms in the sequence. This will be important for calculating \\(3^n \\mod 5\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating \\(3^{20} \\mod 5\\)**\n\n**Approach:**\nI need to find the remainder of \\(3^{20}\\) when divided by \\(5\\). Let's use properties of exponents and modular arithmetic.\n\n- **Using Fermat's Little Theorem:**\n  - **Theorem Statement:** If \\(p\\) is a prime and \\(a\\) is not divisible by \\(p\\), then \\(a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p\\).\n  - **Applying It Here:**\n    - \\(p = 5\\)\n    - \\(a = 3\\) (since \\(3\\) is not divisible by \\(5\\))\n    - Therefore, \\(3^{4} \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\).\n\n- **Breaking Down \\(3^{20}\\):**\n  \\[\n  3^{20} = (3^4)^5 \\equiv 1^5 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5.\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nThis seems neat. By reducing the exponent using Fermat's theorem, I simplified the calculation significantly. Let's verify if this approach is correct.\n\n- **Quick Verification:**\n  - \\(3^4 = 81\\)\n  - \\(81 \\mod 5 = 1\\)\n  - Therefore, \\(3^{20} = (3^4)^5 \\equiv 1^5 = 1 \\mod 5\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe remainder when \\(3^{20}\\) is divided by \\(5\\) is \\(1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLooking back, all terms in the product were congruent to \\(3 \\mod 5\\), and with \\(20\\) terms, the product reduces to \\(3^{20} \\mod 5\\). According to Fermat's Little Theorem, this simplifies to \\(1 \\mod 5\\).\n\n- **Checking Each Step:**\n  - **Identifying the Sequence:** Correctly determined the number of terms.\n  - **Applying Fermat's Theorem:** Correctly applied to reduce the exponent.\n  - **Calculations Modulo \\(5\\):** Consistently yielded a remainder of \\(1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The approach was straightforward, and using Fermat's Little Theorem made the calculation efficient. There doesn't appear to be any mistakes or oversights.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Summary:**\nThe remainder when \\(3 \\times 13 \\times 23 \\times \\ldots \\times 193\\) is divided by \\(5\\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).\n\n---\n\n**Recap of the Thought Process:**\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by exploring different strategies, settled on direct calculation modulo \\(5\\).\n- **Pattern Recognition:** Noticed all terms are congruent to \\(3 \\mod 5\\).\n- **Exponent Reduction:** Used Fermat's Little Theorem to simplify \\(3^{20} \\mod 5\\).\n- **Verification:** Checked each step to ensure correctness.\n\nThroughout, I remained open to changing my approach and frequently checked if the method made sense, ensuring a reliable and accurate solution.\n\nHope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding how to approach and solve such problems step-by-step!",
