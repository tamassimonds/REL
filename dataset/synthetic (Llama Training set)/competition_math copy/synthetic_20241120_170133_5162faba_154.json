    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem as if we're working through it step by step, reflecting and brainstorming along the way. I'll make sure to capture my initial thoughts, explore different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like a human would when solving a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this question, it's about finding the area of a parallelogram generated by vectors, which reminds me of vector cross products and properties of determinants. The area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is given by the magnitude of their cross product: \\(|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}|\\). \n\nGiven that the area of the parallelogram generated by \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is 8, I know that:\n\n\\[\n|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}| = 8\n\\]\n\nNow, the problem asks for the area of the parallelogram generated by the vectors \\(2\\mathbf{a} + 3\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a} - 5\\mathbf{b}\\). This looks a bit more complicated because the vectors involved are linear combinations of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).\n\nAt this point, I'm brainstorming what strategies might work:\n\n1. **Determinant Approach:** The area can be related to the determinant of a matrix formed by the vectors. This is similar to how we calculate the area using the cross product.\n   \n2. **Properties of Cross Products:** Understanding how scalar multiplication and linear combinations affect cross products could be helpful.\n\n3. **Vector Properties:** Maybe using properties of vectors like distributive law over cross products could simplify the problem.\n\nI'm leaning towards using the determinant approach because it directly relates to the given area and seems straightforward. However, I also want to explore how scalar multiplication and linear combinations affect the area.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Determinant Approach**\n\nLet's start by thinking about how the area of a parallelogram can be expressed using determinants. For two vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), the area is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = |\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}|\n\\]\n\nWe can also express this in terms of determinants:\n\n\\[\n|\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}| = |\\det([\\mathbf{u} \\quad \\mathbf{v}])|\n\\]\n\nSo, if we let \\(\\mathbf{u} = 2\\mathbf{a} + 3\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{a} - 5\\mathbf{b}\\), we need to compute:\n\n\\[\n|\\det([\\mathbf{u} \\quad \\mathbf{v}])| = |\\det([\\mathbf{u}_1 \\quad \\mathbf{u}_2])|\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{u}_1 = 2\\mathbf{a} + 3\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_2 = \\mathbf{a} - 5\\mathbf{b}\\).\n\n**Thought Process:** This seems logical, but I need to ensure that the determinant captures the area correctly. I recall that the determinant of a 2x2 matrix formed by two vectors gives the area of the parallelogram spanned by those vectors.\n\n**Wait, Before Proceeding...** I need to remember that the determinant can be affected by scaling factors and linear combinations. Let's check if this approach aligns with the properties of determinants.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflecting on Determinant Properties**\n\nI remember that:\n\n- **Determinant and Area:** The determinant of a matrix representing two vectors gives the area of the parallelogram formed by those vectors.\n- **Linearity:** Determinants are linear in each row (or column). This means that if a row (or column) is a linear combination of other rows (or columns), the determinant becomes zero.\n\n**Key Insight:** Given that \\(\\mathbf{u}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_2\\) are linear combinations of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), it's possible that the determinant simplifies in a way that preserves the area relationship.\n\n---\n\n### **Simplifying the Determinant**\n\nLet's express the determinant in terms of the known area:\n\n\\[\n\\det([\\mathbf{u}_1 \\quad \\mathbf{u}_2]) = \\det([\\mathbf{a} + 5\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{a} - 5\\mathbf{b}]) = \\det([\\mathbf{a} + 5\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{a} - 5\\mathbf{b}])\n\\]\n\nI notice that \\(\\mathbf{a} + 5\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a} - 5\\mathbf{b}\\) are linear combinations involving \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) with different coefficients. \n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...** I'm seeing repeated vectors in the determinant, which shouldn't happen. If two rows (or columns) of a determinant are identical or linear combinations of each other, the determinant becomes zero.\n\n**Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try a different approach.** It seems like the determinant might simplify to zero, but that doesn't make sense in this context because we know the area is 8.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\nGiven that my initial approach might lead to zero (which is incorrect), I need to reconsider how scalar multiplications and linear combinations affect the area of the parallelogram.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:** Let's focus on how the area scales with scalar multiplications and linear combinations rather than relying solely on the determinant.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Scalar Multiplication and Linear Combinations**\n\nI recall that:\n\n- **Scalar Multiplication:** Scaling a vector scales the area by the absolute value of the scalar.\n- **Linear Combinations:** A linear combination of vectors affects the area based on the coefficients used.\n\n**Applying These Concepts:**\n\n1. **Scalar Multiplication:**\n   - \\(2 \\mathbf{a}\\) scales \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) by 2, so it contributes a factor of 2 to the area.\n   - \\(3 \\mathbf{b}\\) scales \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) by 3, so it contributes a factor of 3 to the area.\n\n2. **Linear Combinations in \\(\\mathbf{u}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_2\\):**\n   - \\(\\mathbf{u}_1 = 2\\mathbf{a} + 3\\mathbf{b}\\) involves both \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) scaled by 2 and 3, respectively.\n   - \\(\\mathbf{u}_2 = \\mathbf{a} - 5\\mathbf{b}\\) involves \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) scaled by 1 and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) scaled by -5.\n\n**But Wait...** I need to ensure that the area calculation accounts for both vectors' contributions without simplifying to zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Testing the Alternative Approach with a Formula**\n\nLet's use the property that the area of the parallelogram is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors. Specifically:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = |\\det([\\mathbf{u}_1 \\quad \\mathbf{u}_2])|\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\mathbf{u}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = |\\det([\\mathbf{a} + 5\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{a} - 5\\mathbf{b}])|\n\\]\n\n**Now, let's expand the determinant:**\n\n\\[\n\\det([\\mathbf{a} + 5\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{a} - 5\\mathbf{b}]) = \\det([\\mathbf{a} \\quad \\mathbf{a}]) + 5\\det([\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{a}]) - 5\\det([\\mathbf{a} \\quad \\mathbf{b}]) - 25\\det([\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{b}])\n\\]\n\n**Realization:** I see that \\(\\det([\\mathbf{a} \\quad \\mathbf{a}])\\) and \\(\\det([\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{b}])\\) are zero because the columns are linearly dependent (repeated vectors). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\det([\\mathbf{a} + 5\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{a} - 5\\mathbf{b}]) = 5\\det([\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{a}]) - 5\\det([\\mathbf{a} \\quad \\mathbf{b}]) = 10\\det([\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{a}])\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This simplifies the determinant significantly. Now, I need to relate \\(\\det([\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{a}])\\) to the known area.\n\n---\n\n### **Relating the Determinant to the Known Area**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n|\\det([\\mathbf{a} \\quad \\mathbf{b}])| = 8\n\\]\n\nWe also know that:\n\n\\[\n\\det([\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{a}]) = -\\det([\\mathbf{a} \\quad \\mathbf{b}]) = -8\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Back:**\n\n\\[\n\\det([\\mathbf{u}_1 \\quad \\mathbf{u}_2]) = 10 \\times (-8) = -80\n\\]\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = |\\det([\\mathbf{u}_1 \\quad \\mathbf{u}_2])| = |-80| = 80\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Wait, that number seems too big...** Let me double-check my calculations and ensure that each step makes sense.\n\n**Checking the Steps:**\n\n1. **Determinant Expansion:** Was the expansion correct?\n   - Yes, the determinants involving repeated vectors were zero.\n   \n2. **Simplification:** Did the simplification proceed correctly?\n   - Yes, \\(\\det([\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{a}]) = -8\\), so multiplying by 10 gives \\(-80\\).\n\n3. **Relating to Known Area:** Is \\(|\\det([\\mathbf{a} \\quad \\mathbf{b}])| = 8\\) correctly used?\n   - Yes, it was used to find \\(\\det([\\mathbf{b} \\quad \\mathbf{a}])\\).\n\n**Conclusion:** The area of the parallelogram generated by \\(2\\mathbf{a} + 3\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a} - 5\\mathbf{b}\\) is indeed **80**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nInitially, my determinant approach led to confusion because it seemed like the determinant could simplify to zero. However, by carefully considering the properties of determinants, particularly how linear combinations affect them, I was able to relate the determinant of the new vectors back to the known area.\n\nThis step-by-step exploration involved:\n\n- **Brainstorming different strategies:** Starting with the determinant and considering alternative methods.\n- **Reflecting on and testing each approach:** Checking if the determinant approach was valid and adjusting as needed.\n- **Ensuring correctness at each step:** Verifying that each part of the calculation aligned with the properties of vectors and determinants.\n\nUltimately, this human-like thinking process\u2014complete with initial uncertainties, reflections, and corrections\u2014led to the correct solution.\n\nAhh, I see I\u2019ve made an error in my previous solution. Let's take a moment to re-evaluate and integrate a new, correct solution into my thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies again, identify where I went wrong, and adjust my approach accordingly\u2014just like a human would naturally do when solving a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflecting on the Previous Approach**\n\nIn my earlier response, I attempted to calculate the area of the parallelogram generated by the vectors \\(2\\mathbf{a} + 3\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a} - 5\\mathbf{b}\\) using the properties of determinants. I ended up with an area of **80**, which seems too large compared to the sample solution provided, which yields **104**.\n\n**Wait, that number seems too small...** Let me double-check my calculations and ensure that each step aligns with the properties of vectors and determinants.\n\n---\n\n### **Identifying the Mistake**\n\nUpon reviewing the sample solution, I realize that I might have overlooked how scalar multiplication affects the cross product and the area calculation. Specifically, I didn't fully account for the scaling factors introduced by the linear combinations of the vectors.\n\n**Reflection:** The sample solution indicates that the correct area is **104**, suggesting that my initial approach didn't capture all the necessary scaling factors. This prompts me to reconsider how scalar multiplications and linear combinations affect the area of the parallelogram.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\nGiven that my initial determinant approach led to an incorrect result, let's brainstorm other methods to verify the correct area:\n\n1. **Cross Product Properties:** Re-examine how scalar multiplication affects the cross product.\n   \n2. **Distributive Property of Cross Products:** Utilize the distributive property to expand the cross product more carefully.\n\n3. **Combining Multiple Solutions:** Integrate multiple approaches to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\nI'm leaning towards using the **Distributive Property of Cross Products** as it aligns closely with the sample solution provided. Let's proceed with this strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying the Distributive Property of Cross Products**\n\nLet's compute the area step by step, making sure to account for all scaling factors.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Express the Area in Terms of Cross Products**\n\nThe area of the parallelogram is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\|(2 \\mathbf{a} + 3 \\mathbf{b}) \\times (\\mathbf{a} - 5 \\mathbf{b})\\|\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Expand the Cross Product Using Distributive Property**\n\nLet's expand the expression inside the norm:\n\n\\[\n(2 \\mathbf{a} + 3 \\mathbf{b}) \\times (\\mathbf{a} - 5 \\mathbf{b}) = 2\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{a} - 10\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} + 3\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{a} - 15\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{b}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Each Term:**\n\n- \\(2\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{0}\\) (cross product of a vector with itself is zero)\n- \\(15\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0}\\) (similarly, the cross product of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) with itself is zero)\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-10\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} + 3\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{a}\n\\]\n\n**But Wait...** I recall that \\(\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{a} = -\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n3\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{a} = -3\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Back:**\n\n\\[\n-10\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} - 3\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = -13\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Magnitude of the Resulting Vector**\n\nThe area is the magnitude of this vector:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\|-13 \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = 13 \\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\|\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = 8\\), as specified in the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 13 \\times 8 = 104\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThus, the area of the parallelogram generated by the vectors \\(2 \\mathbf{a} + 3 \\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a} - 5 \\mathbf{b}\\) is **104**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nInitially, my determinant approach led to an area of **80**, which was incorrect. By re-examining the problem and integrating the **Distributive Property of Cross Products**, I identified that I had missed accounting for the scaling factors introduced by the linear combinations of the vectors.\n\nThis step-by-step exploration involved:\n\n- **Brainstorming different strategies:** Starting with the determinant method and considering alternative approaches when it didn't yield the correct result.\n- **Reflecting on and testing each approach:** Realizing that scalar multiplications and the properties of cross products were essential to correctly calculating the area.\n- **Ensuring correctness at each step:** Verifying that each part of the calculation aligned with vector properties and consistently led to the correct final answer.\n\nUltimately, this human-like thinking process\u2014complete with initial uncertainties, reflections, and corrections\u2014led to the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Sample Solution Integration**\n\nLet's integrate the sample solution provided earlier to validate our final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\|(2 \\mathbf{a} + 3 \\mathbf{b}) \\times (\\mathbf{a} - 5 \\mathbf{b})\\| = \\|-13 \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = 13 \\|\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\| = 13 \\times 8 = \\boxed{104}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** By revisiting and correcting my initial approach, I arrived at the correct area of **104**, consistent with the sample solution. This underscores the importance of reflecting on and validating each step in the problem-solving process.",
