    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my methods, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's mirror human thought processes, complete with initial confusion, realizations, and maybe even a few mistakes along the way.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I first read the question, I see it's asking for the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the first three prime numbers. \n\nHmm, prime numbers are those greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Okay, I think I need to identify the first three primes, find their reciprocals, and then calculate the mean. But let me brainstorm a bit more to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Strategy 1:** List the first three prime numbers, find their reciprocals, and then calculate the mean.\n- **Strategy 2:** Alternatively, I could think about properties of primes and means to see if there's a shortcut.\n\nI'm leaning towards **Strategy 1** because it seems straightforward: identify the primes, compute their reciprocals, and find the mean. But I'll keep **Strategy 2** in mind in case the calculations get messy.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the First Three Prime Numbers**\n\n**Thinking:**\nLet me recall the prime numbers. I know they start with 2, followed by 3, and then 5. \n\n- **First Prime:** 2\n- **Second Prime:** 3\n- **Third Prime:** 5\n\nWait, am I sure these are the first three primes? Let me double-check.\n\n**Check:**\nYes, primes are numbers greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and themselves. 2, 3, and 5 fit this criterion.\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, I've got the primes. Now onto the next step.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Reciprocals of the Prime Numbers**\n\n**Thinking:**\nI need to find the reciprocal of each of these primes. The reciprocal of a number \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\).\n\nSo:\n\n- **Reciprocal of 2:** \\(\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\\)\n- **Reciprocal of 3:** \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333\\)\n- **Reciprocal of 5:** \\(\\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\\)\n\n**Check:**\nLet me quickly verify these reciprocals make sense.\n\n- \\(\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(\\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe reciprocals seem correct. Proceeding to the next step.\n\n### **Step 4: Adding the Reciprocals Together**\n\n**Thinking:**\nNow, I need to find the arithmetic mean, which involves adding these reciprocals together. But wait, since the denominators are different, I should probably find a common denominator first.\n\n**Strategy Reconsideration:**\nHmm, aligning the denominators could make the addition easier, but let's see if it's necessary. Maybe adding them as fractions is straightforward enough.\n\n**Strategy 1:** Add as fractions directly.\n\n**Strategy 2:** Convert to decimals and add.\n\n**Decision:**\nI'll try **Strategy 1** first\u2014adding as fractions. If it gets too complicated, I'll switch to **Strategy 2**\u2014adding as decimals.\n\nLet's proceed with Strategy 1.\n\n**Adding Fractions:**\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Finding a Common Denominator:**\nThe denominators are 2, 3, and 5. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 30. \n\n**Converting to Common Denominator:**\n\n- \\(\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{15}{30}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{10}{30}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{6}{30}\\)\n\n**Adding the Fractions:**\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{30} + \\frac{10}{30} + \\frac{6}{30} = \\frac{31}{30}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nLet me quickly verify the addition.\n\n\\[\n15 + 10 + 6 = 31 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{31}{30} = 1.0333\\ldots \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe sum of the reciprocals as fractions is \\(\\frac{31}{30}\\), which is \\(1.0333...\\) as a decimal. This seems correct. Now, let's find the mean.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Arithmetic Mean**\n\n**Thinking:**\nThe arithmetic mean is the sum divided by the number of terms. \n\nSo, \n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\frac{31}{30}}{3} = \\frac{31}{30 \\times 3} = \\frac{31}{90}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nLet me verify the division.\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 3 = 90 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{31}{90} \\approx 0.3444\\ldots \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe mean of the reciprocals is \\(\\frac{31}{90}\\), or approximately \\(0.3444\\). This makes sense. Let's briefly reflect to ensure everything aligns.\n\n### **Step 6: Quick Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **First Primes Correct?** Yes, 2, 3, 5 are indeed the first three primes.\n- **Reciprocals Accurate?** Yes, \\(\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\\), \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333\\), \\(\\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\\).\n- **Sum of Reciprocals?** \\(\\frac{31}{30} = 1.0333\\ldots\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Arithmetic Mean?** \\(\\frac{31}{90} \\approx 0.3444\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nEverything checks out. The approach seems correct, and the calculations align with expectations. I'm confident the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the first three prime numbers is \\(\\frac{31}{90}\\) or approximately \\(0.3444\\).\n\n**Oops Moment:**\nWait... let me re-examine. I divided the sum \\(\\frac{31}{30}\\) by 3 to find the mean, which should yield \\[\\frac{31}{90}\\]. That seems correct. No errors here.\n\n**Realization:**\nAt first, I briefly considered converting all fractions to decimals before finding the mean, but sticking to fractions was cleaner and avoided rounding errors.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\nThe arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the first three prime numbers is \\(\\frac{31}{90}\\) or approximately \\(0.3444\\).\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\nI started by identifying the first three primes, calculated their reciprocals, and added them up using a common denominator. After finding the sum, I computed the arithmetic mean by dividing by the number of primes. Throughout the process, I checked each step to ensure accuracy, catching and correcting any potential missteps early on. This step-by-step approach, with regular reflections and checks, led to a confident and correct solution.\n\n**End Note:**\nThis human-like thinking approach\u2014brainstorming, strategizing, checking, reflecting, and adjusting\u2014ensures not just correctness but also a deeper understanding of the problem-solving process. It mimics how someone might naturally think through a math problem, complete with uncertainties and affirmations.\n\n### **User Query Recap:**\nFind the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the first three prime numbers.\n\n**Solving the Problem:**\n\n1. **Identified the First Three Primes:**\n   - 2, 3, and 5\n\n2. **Calculated Their Reciprocals:**\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\\)\n\n3. **Summed the Reciprocals:**\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{31}{30} \\approx 1.0333\\)\n\n4. **Calculated the Arithmetic Mean:**\n   - \\(\\frac{\\frac{31}{30}}{3} = \\frac{31}{90} \\approx 0.3444\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the first three prime numbers is \\(\\frac{31}{90}\\) or approximately \\(0.3444\\).\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, reflecting frequently, and checking my work, I ensured a thorough and accurate solution.

  "ground_truth": "The first three prime numbers are $2$, $3$, and $5$, and their reciprocals are $1/2$, $1/3$, and $1/5$ respectively. To find the mean of these three numbers, we must first find their sum and then divide that sum by $3$. To find the sum of $1/2$, $1/3$, and $1/5$, we first place each fraction over their least common denominator of $30$. Thus, we have that $$\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{15}{30} + \\frac{10}{30} + \\frac{6}{30} = \\frac{31}{30}.$$\n\nDividing $\\frac{31}{30}$ by $3$, we get that the mean of these three numbers is $\\frac{31}{30 \\cdot 3} = \\boxed{\\frac{31}{90}}$."
