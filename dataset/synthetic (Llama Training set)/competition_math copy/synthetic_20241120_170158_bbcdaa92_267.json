    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where our brainstorming takes us. The question is to find the number of degrees in \\( x \\) given a geometric figure with specific angle labels. Let's start by exploring different ways to approach this.\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, I see a triangle with angles labeled \\( 30^\\circ \\), \\( x \\), and \\( 2x \\). My initial reaction is to consider the properties of triangles, particularly the fact that the sum of internal angles always equals \\( 180^\\circ \\). This reminds me of basic trigonometry and angle sum properties I've dealt with before.\n\nHowever, I also notice that the angle at vertex \\( B \\) is labeled \\( 2x \\), which makes me think about double angle identities. But honestly, I'm not sure if trigonometric identities are necessary here since it's just a simple triangle.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle:**\n   - Total internal angles = \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n   - Set up an equation: \\( 30^\\circ + x + 2x = 180^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Geometric Properties or Theorems:**\n   - Maybe there's a specific theorem that applies to this type of triangle, especially since \\( 2x \\) suggests a double angle.\n\n3. **Visual Inspection:**\n   - Perhaps analyzing the figure could give clues about isosceles properties or other symmetries.\n\n4. **Alternative Methods:**\n   - If basic angle sums don't work out, consider external angles or look for supplementary angles.\n\nAt this point, the *Sum of Angles in a Triangle* seems the most straightforward. Let's proceed with that and see if it leads to a sensible solution.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Sum of Angles**\n\nLet's set up the equation based on the sum of internal angles in a triangle:\n\n\\[\n30^\\circ + x + 2x = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n30^\\circ + 3x = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract \\( 30^\\circ \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n3x = 180^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 150^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{150^\\circ}{3} = 50^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a second. Let me check if this makes sense. If \\( x = 50^\\circ \\), then \\( 2x = 100^\\circ \\). Adding these up with the given \\( 30^\\circ \\):\n\n\\[\n30^\\circ + 50^\\circ + 100^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThe sum is indeed \\( 180^\\circ \\), so the calculation seems correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Result**\n\nBefore finalizing, it's always good to double-check. Let's verify if the angles add up correctly:\n\n- \\( x = 50^\\circ \\)\n- \\( 2x = 100^\\circ \\)\n- Given \\( 30^\\circ \\)\n\nAdding them:\n\n\\[\n30^\\circ + 50^\\circ + 100^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThe total is \\( 180^\\circ \\), which is correct for a triangle.\n\n**Ahh Moment:**\n\nThis confirms that the approach was correct. The sum of angles property directly led to the solution without any need for complex theorems or trigonometric identities.\n\n### **Alternative Approach:**\n\nJust to ensure completeness, let's consider if there might be another way to verify this:\n\n**Using External Angles:**\n\nPerhaps looking at external angles could provide a different perspective, but since all angles are internal and the question specifically asks for \\( x \\), external angles might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe **Sum of Angles in a Triangle** method worked perfectly here. It provided a straightforward path to the solution, confirming that \\( x = 50^\\circ \\).\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe number of degrees in \\( x \\) is **50**.\n\nAhh Moment:\n\nIt's reassuring to see that multiple checks (sum of angles, verification) align with the initial calculation. This reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\nOverall, brainstorming different strategies, starting with the most straightforward, and double-checking along the way ensured a robust and accurate solution.",
