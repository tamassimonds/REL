    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, exploring various approaches, and reflecting as I go, just like I would when solving a problem on paper. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**What is \\(\\binom{n}{n-1}\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\)? (Answer in terms of \\(n\\).)**\n\n- My immediate reaction is: \"This looks like a binomial coefficient. I remember something about choosing items from a set.\"\n  \n- **Connection:** It reminds me of combinations, where \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) represents the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) items from \\(n\\). Here, \\(k\\) is \\(n-1\\), which seems interesting.\n\n- **Initial Idea:** Maybe there's a property of binomial coefficients that simplifies this? Or perhaps I can compute it directly for small \\(n\\) to spot a pattern.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure if there's a straightforward formula for \\(\\binom{n}{n-1}\\), so exploring different strategies seems essential.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Computation for Small \\(n\\):** Compute \\(\\binom{n}{n-1}\\) for small values like \\(n = 2, 3, 4\\) to look for a pattern.\n\n2. **Use Binomial Coefficient Properties:** Recall properties like \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}\\) and see if that helps.\n\n3. **Algebraic Simplification:** Attempt to simplify the expression using the definition of binomial coefficients.\n\n4. **Inductive Reasoning:** Maybe use mathematical induction to verify if a pattern holds for all \\(n\\).\n\n5. **Combinatorial Interpretation:** Think about what \\(\\binom{n}{n-1}\\) represents in terms of choosing elements from a set.\n\n- **Reflection:** Given that binomial coefficients can sometimes simplify in surprising ways, I think starting with a small \\(n\\) might be beneficial to build intuition. If that doesn't lead anywhere, I can try the properties approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Direct Computation for Small \\(n\\)**\n\n**Let's try computing \\(\\binom{n}{n-1}\\) for small positive integers \\(n\\):**\n\n- **For \\(n = 2\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{2}{1} = \\frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!} = \\frac{2 \\times 1}{1 \\times 1} = 2\n  \\]\n  \n- **For \\(n = 3\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{2 \\times 1 \\times 1} = 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **For \\(n = 4\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 1} = 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Pattern Noticed:** When \\(n = 2, 3, 4\\), \\(\\binom{n}{n-1} = n\\).\n\n- **Reflection:** This suggests that \\(\\binom{n}{n-1} = n\\) for these cases. But is it true for all positive integers \\(n\\)? It seems likely, but I need to verify further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Use Binomial Coefficient Properties**\n\n**Recall that \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}\\).**\n\n- **Applying this to our case:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{n}{n-1} = \\binom{n}{1}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Interpretation:** This means \\(\\binom{n}{n-1}\\) is the same as choosing 1 element out of \\(n\\).\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{n}{1} = \\frac{n!}{1!(n-1)!} = \\frac{n \\times (n-1)!}{1 \\times (n-1)!} = n\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:** So, \\(\\binom{n}{n-1} = n\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\).\n\n- **Reflection:** This property confirms what I observed in the direct computation. It seems consistent. But let me check if this aligns with a combinatorial interpretation as well.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combinatorial Interpretation**\n\n**Think about what \\(\\binom{n}{n-1}\\) represents:**\n\n- **Choosing \\(n-1\\) elements from an \\(n\\)-element set:** When you choose \\(n-1\\) elements, you're essentially leaving out 1 element. \n\n- **Simpler Perspective:** There are \\(n\\) different ways to leave out one element from the set of \\(n\\). Therefore, \\(\\binom{n}{n-1} = n\\).\n\n- **Verification:** This aligns with our previous findings. It makes sense that choosing all but one element is equivalent to selecting which single element not to include, which can be done in \\(n\\) ways.\n\n- **Reflection:** Combining different approaches strengthens the conclusion. Direct computation, properties, and combinatorial interpretation all point to the same answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Inductive Reasoning**\n\n**Consider using mathematical induction to verify:**\n\n- **Base Case:** For \\(n = 2\\),\n  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{2}{1} = 2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Inductive Step:** Assume it's true for \\(n = k\\), i.e., \\(\\binom{k}{k-1} = k\\).\n\n- **Need to Prove for \\(n = k + 1\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{k+1}{k} = \\frac{(k+1)!}{k!(k+1-k)!} = \\frac{(k+1) \\times k!}{k! \\times 1} = k + 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:** The inductive step holds, so by induction, \\(\\binom{n}{n-1} = n\\) for all \\(n \\geq 2\\).\n\n- **Reflection:** Induction provides a robust confirmation. It's always good to see the pattern hold consistently as a general rule.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Check and Confirmation**\n\n**Quick checks:**\n\n- **Does the answer make sense?** Yes, choosing \\(n-1\\) elements from \\(n\\) naturally leaves one element out, which can be done in \\(n\\) ways.\n\n- **All methods agree:** Direct computation, properties, combinatorial interpretation, and induction all yield the same result.\n\n- **Potential Mistakes:** Initially, I was unsure if there was a direct formula, but exploring different strategies led me to consistent conclusions. No contradictions were found.\n\n- **Final Answer:**  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{n}{n-1} = n \\quad \\text{for any positive integer } n\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy approaching the problem through multiple strategies\u2014direct computation, leveraging binomial coefficient properties, and employing combinatorial and inductive reasoning\u2014I confirmed that \\(\\binom{n}{n-1} = n\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\). Each method provided a different perspective, all aligning to strengthen the solution's validity. This step-by-step exploration ensured a thorough understanding and accurate answer.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed, human-like thought process helps in understanding how to tackle such problems. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!",
