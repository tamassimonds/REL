    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem just like how I'd approach it if I were solving it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking for correctness, and being ready to pivot if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem is \\(2^{2x} - 3^{2y} = 55\\), and we need to find integer solutions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). \n\n- **Initially, I think**: This looks like an exponential Diophantine equation. I\u2019ve encountered similar problems where powers of integers are involved. \n- **Possible Strategies**: \n  - Try plugging in small integer values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to see if that leads anywhere.\n  - Consider factoring or rearranging the equation.\n  - Maybe logarithms could help, but since we need integer solutions, that might complicate things.\n  - Explore modulo arithmetic to check for possible solutions or contradictions.\n  \nLet me start with the simplest approach: **plugging in small integers**. If that doesn't work, I'll move on to factoring or mod checks.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Plugging in Small Integer Values**\n\nI'll start by testing small integer values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to see if I can find any solutions.\n\n- **Let\u2019s try \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = 0\\)**:\n  \\[\n  2^{2(0)} - 3^{2(0)} = 1 - 1 = 0\n  \\]\n  - **Wait**, that equals 0, not 55. So, no solution here.\n\n- **Next, try \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\)**:\n  \\[\n  2^{2(1)} - 3^{2(1)} = 4 - 9 = -5\n  \\]\n  - **Hmm**, this is negative, so still not a solution.\n\n- **Let\u2019s try \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 1\\)**:\n  \\[\n  2^{2(2)} - 3^{2(1)} = 16 - 9 = 7\n  \\]\n  - **Close**, but still not 55.\n\n- **Let\u2019s increase \\(x\\)**: Try \\(x = 3\\) and \\(y = 1\\):\n  \\[\n  2^{2(3)} - 3^{2(1)} = 64 - 9 = 55\n  \\]\n  - **Aha!** That works. So \\((x, y) = (3, 1)\\) is one solution.\n\n- **But wait**, let me check if there are more solutions by varying \\(y\\) while keeping \\(x = 3\\):\n\n  - **Try \\(y = 0\\)**:\n    \\[\n    2^{6} - 3^{0} = 64 - 1 = 63\n    \\]\n    - **Nope**, not 55.\n\n  - **Try \\(y = 2\\)**:\n    \\[\n    2^{6} - 3^{4} = 64 - 81 = -17\n    \\]\n    - **Negative again**, so no more solutions for \\(y = 2\\).\n\n- **Now, let's check if increasing \\(x\\) further helps**:\n\n  - **Try \\(x = 4\\) and \\(y = 1\\)**:\n    \\[\n    2^{8} - 3^{2} = 256 - 9 = 247\n    \\]\n    - **Too large**, so no solution here.\n\n  - **Try \\(x = 4\\) and \\(y = 0\\)**:\n    \\[\n    2^{8} - 3^{0} = 256 - 1 = 255\n    \\]\n    - **Still too large**.\n\nAt this point, it seems like \\((3, 1)\\) might be the only solution. But **wait**, maybe there\u2019s another value of \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) that I missed.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Considering Negative Values**\n\nLet\u2019s explore negative integers to see if there are more solutions.\n\n- **Try \\(x = -1\\) and \\(y = 1\\)**:\n  \\[\n  2^{-2} - 3^{2} = \\frac{1}{4} - 9 = -8.75\n  \\]\n  - **Not an integer**, so not a solution.\n\n- **Try \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = -1\\)**:\n  \\[\n  2^{2} - 3^{-2} = 4 - \\frac{1}{9} = 4 - 0.111 = 3.889\n  \\]\n  - **Again**, not an integer.\n\n- **Wait**, since negative exponents result in fractions, and we're looking for integer solutions, it seems that negative values won\u2019t work here.\n\n**Reflection**: From this, it looks like looking at negative integers won't yield additional solutions because the equation involves subtraction of powers, which likely results in non-integer values when negative exponents are used.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Reassessing with Modulo Arithmetic**\n\nSince plugging in integers and checking negatives hasn\u2019t brought up more solutions, maybe **modulo arithmetic** could help verify if \\((3, 1)\\) is the only solution.\n\n- **Consider the equation modulo 3**:\n  \\[\n  2^{2x} - 3^{2y} \\equiv 55 \\mod 3\n  \\]\n  - **Simplify \\(3^{2y} \\mod 3\\)**: Since \\(y \\geq 1\\), \\(3^{2y} \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\).\n  - **Simplify \\(55 \\mod 3\\)**: \\(55 \\div 3 = 18\\) remainder \\(1\\), so \\(55 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\).\n  - **Therefore**:\n    \\[\n    2^{2x} - 0 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\implies 2^{2x} \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\n    \\]\n  - **Checking powers of 2 modulo 3**:\n    \\[\n    2^{1} \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\\\\\n    2^{2} \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\n    \\]\n    - **Pattern**: \\(2^{n} \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\) if \\(n\\) is even.\n    - **So, \\(2x\\) must be even**, which implies \\(x\\) must be an integer.\n\n- **Conclusion**: This doesn't contradict our earlier finding. It **confirms** that \\(x\\) needs to be an integer, which aligns with our solution \\((3, 1)\\).\n\n**Reflection**: Using modulo 3 helped confirm that \\(x\\) must be an integer, but since we already found \\((3, 1)\\) as a valid solution, it doesn\u2019t indicate any additional solutions.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\nAt this point, I\u2019ve tried:\n\n1. **Plugging in small integers**: Found \\((3, 1)\\) as a solution.\n2. **Considering negative integers**: No additional solutions found.\n3. **Using modulo arithmetic**: No contradictions found, confirms \\(x\\) must be integer.\n\n**But wait**, perhaps **factoring the equation** could reveal more insights.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Factoring the Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s see if the equation can be factored to find more solutions.\n\n- **Original equation**:\n  \\[\n  2^{2x} - 3^{2y} = 55\n  \\]\n- **Rewrite as difference of squares**:\n  \\[\n  (2^{x})^{2} - (3^{y})^{2} = 55\n  \\]\n  - **This resembles the difference of squares formula**: \n    \\[\n    a^{2} - b^{2} = (a - b)(a + b)\n    \\]\n  - **So,**:\n    \\[\n    (2^{x} - 3^{y})(2^{x} + 3^{y}) = 55\n    \\]\n  \n- **Factor 55**: The possible pairs \\((a - b)(a + b) = 55\\) are:\n  \\[\n  (1, 55), (5, 11), (-1, -55), (-5, -11)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Positive Solutions Only**: Since \\(2^{x}\\) and \\(3^{y}\\) are positive for integers \\(x, y\\), we only consider positive factors.\n\n**Reflection**: This approach looks promising. Let\u2019s see which pairs can yield integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Analyzing Factor Pairs**\n\nLet\u2019s solve for \\(2^{x}\\) and \\(3^{y}\\) using the factor pairs.\n\n1. **First Pair: (1, 55)**:\n   \\[\n   2^{x} - 3^{y} = 1\\\\\n   2^{x} + 3^{y} = 55\n   \\]\n   - **Add the equations**:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 2^{x} = 56 \\implies 2^{x} = 28 \\implies x = \\log_{2}(28) \\approx 4.807\n     \\]\n     - **Wait**, \\(x\\) must be an integer, so this doesn't work.\n\n2. **Second Pair: (5, 11)**:\n   \\[\n   2^{x} - 3^{y} = 5\\\\\n   2^{x} + 3^{y} = 11\n   \\]\n   - **Add the equations**:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 2^{x} = 16 \\implies 2^{x} = 8 \\implies x = 3\n     \\]\n   - **Then, find \\(3^{y}\\)**:\n     \\[\n     3^{y} = 11 - 2^{x} = 11 - 8 = 3 \\implies y = 1\n     \\]\n   - **Solution found**: \\((x, y) = (3, 1)\\)\n\n3. **Third Pair: (-1, -55)**: Negatives yield no solutions since \\(2^{x}\\) and \\(3^{y}\\) are positive.\n\n4. **Fourth Pair: (-5, -11)**: Same as above, no solutions.\n\n**Wait**, only the second pair gives us the solution we already found \\((3, 1)\\).\n\n**Reflection**: This factoring approach also points us to \\((3, 1)\\) as the solution. It doesn\u2019t seem to reveal any additional solutions.\n\n---\n\n**Final Step: Verifying the Solution**\n\nSince both plugging in integers and factoring lead us to \\((3, 1)\\) as the only solution, I\u2019ll do a quick verification to ensure everything checks out.\n\n- **Plugging \\((3, 1)\\) back into the original equation**:\n  \\[\n  2^{2(3)} - 3^{2(1)} = 64 - 9 = 55\n  \\]\n  - **Correct, it satisfies the equation**.\n\n**Reflection**: This consistent result across different strategies reassures me that \\((3, 1)\\) is indeed the only solution.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring various strategies\u2014plugging in values, considering negatives, using modulo arithmetic, and factoring\u2014I\u2019ve determined that **the number of integer solutions is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)**, with the solution being \\((x, y) = (3, 1)\\).\n\nThis step-by-step approach, reflecting and checking along the way, confirms that \\((3, 1)\\) is the sole solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $a = 2^x$ and $b = 3^y$. Substituting these values results in\\[a^2 - b^2 = 55\\]Factor the difference of squares to get\\[(a + b)(a - b) = 55\\]If $y < 0$, then $55 + 3^{2y} < 64$, so $y$ can not be negative. If $x < 0$, then $2^{2x} < 1$. Since $3^{2y}$ is always positive, the result would be way less than $55$, so $x$ can not be negative. Thus, $x$ and $y$ have to be nonnegative, so $a$ and $b$ are integers. Thus,\\[a+b=55 \\text{ and } a-b=1\\]\\[\\text{or}\\]\\[a+b=11 \\text{ and } a-b=5\\]From the first case, $a = 28$ and $b = 27$. Since $2^x = 28$ does not have an integral solution, the first case does not work. From the second case, $a = 8$ and $b = 3$. Thus, $x = 3$ and $y = 1$. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ solution."
