    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were working through it myself. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, reflect often, check my work, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, **\"What is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\(5!\\) and \\(7!\\)?\"**, a few things come to mind:\n\n- **Understanding Factorials:** I remember that \\(n!\\) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \\(n\\). So, \\(5!\\) and \\(7!\\) are products of different ranges.\n  \n- **Properties of Factorials:** Since \\(7!\\) includes all the factors of \\(5!\\) (because \\(7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5!\\)), maybe there's a relationship I can leverage.\n\n- **GCD Concept:** The GCD is the largest integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. So, I'm looking for the common factors.\n\nHonestly, I'm feeling a bit uncertain about which strategy to start with. Should I calculate both factorials completely and find their GCD directly? Or is there a shortcut leveraging the properties of factorials?\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate \\(5!\\) and \\(7!\\) Individually:**\n   - Pros: Simple and straightforward; directly finds the GCD.\n   - Cons: Could involve large numbers; might be time-consuming.\n\n2. **Use the Property of Factorials:**\n   - Since \\(7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5!\\), maybe the GCD is related to \\(5!\\).\n   - This seems promising because it reduces the problem.\n\n3. **Apply the GCD Formula for Factorials:**\n   - There's a mathematical property that \\(\\text{gcd}(n!, m!) = \\min(n, m)!\\).\n   - This could save time and effort.\n\nReflecting on these options, the **second strategy**\u2014leveraging the relationship between \\(5!\\) and \\(7!\\)\u2014seems the most efficient. However, to validate this approach, I'll check if the formula \\(\\text{gcd}(n!, m!) = \\min(n, m)!\\) holds true here.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the GCD Formula for Factorials**\n\nLet's apply the property:\n\n\\[\n\\text{gcd}(n!, m!) = \\min(n, m)!\n\\]\n\nIn our case:\n\n\\[\nn = 5, \\quad m = 7 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\min(5, 7) = 5\n\\]\n\nSo according to the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{gcd}(5!, 7!) = 5!\n\\]\n\nWait a minute\u2014this makes sense because \\(5!\\) is a factor of \\(7!\\). But let me double-check to ensure this property applies universally.\n\nReflection: **Does this always hold true?**\n\nThinking it through, the reason is that \\(m!\\) (where \\(m > n\\)) includes all the factors of \\(n!\\) multiplied by additional factors. So, \\(n!\\) divides \\(m!\\), making \\(n!\\) the GCD.\n\nAlright, I think this approach is valid. But just to be sure, I'll proceed by calculating \\(5!\\) and \\(7!\\) to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate \\(5!\\)**\n\n\\[\n5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\n\\]\n\nLet's compute it step by step:\n\n- \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\)\n- \\(20 \\times 3 = 60\\)\n- \\(60 \\times 2 = 120\\)\n- \\(120 \\times 1 = 120\\)\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** That seems reasonable. \\(5!\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me quickly check if this matches my earlier understanding. Yes, \\(5!\\) is indeed 120.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate \\(7!\\)**\n\n\\[\n7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5!\n\\]\n\nSince I already know \\(5! = 120\\), let's compute \\(7!\\):\n\n\\[\n7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 120\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\)\n- \\(42 \\times 120 = 5040\\)\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5040}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, \\(7! = 5040\\). This aligns with what I expect. \\(7!\\) should be significantly larger than \\(5!\\), given that it includes more factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Find the GCD of \\(5!\\) and \\(7!\\)**\n\nNow, according to the property we discussed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{gcd}(5!, 7!) = 5!\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{gcd}(120, 5040) = 120\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Let's see if 120 divides 5040 without a remainder.\n\n\\[\n5040 \\div 120 = 42\n\\]\n\nYes, 42 is an integer, so 120 is indeed a divisor of 5040.\n\n**Reflection:** This confirms that our approach is correct. The GCD is 120.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore concluding, let's ensure everything makes sense:\n\n- **Did I calculate the factorials correctly?** Yes, both \\(5!\\) and \\(7!\\) were computed step by step.\n- **Does the GCD property hold?** Yes, \\(5!\\) is a factor of \\(7!\\), so it logically follows that \\(\\text{gcd}(5!, 7!) = 5!\\).\n- **Is the final answer consistent?** Yes, the GCD is 120, which matches \\(5!\\).\n\nEverything checks out. The initial strategy was correct, and the property of factorials provided a quick and efficient path to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and validating the GCD property for factorials, I've confirmed that the greatest common divisor of \\(5!\\) and \\(7!\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]\n\nThis approach not only saved time by avoiding the computation of large numbers but also reinforced the understanding of how factorials relate to each other regarding their GCD.",

So, we have  \\[5! = 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{120}.\\]"
