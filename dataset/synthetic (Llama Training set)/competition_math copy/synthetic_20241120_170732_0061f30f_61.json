    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, emulating a human thought process with brainstorming, reflections, and checks along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the question, **\"A number in the set {50, 51, 52, ..., 999} is randomly selected. What is the probability that it is a two-digit number?\"**\n\nInitially, a few things come to mind:\n\n- **Understanding the Set:** The set starts at 50 and goes up to 999. So, it includes all integers between these two bounds.\n  \n- **Two-Digit Numbers:** I know that two-digit numbers range from 10 to 99. However, since our set starts at 50, I need to focus on two-digit numbers within 50 to 99.\n\n- **Probability Concept:** Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to find how many two-digit numbers are in the set and divide that by the total number of numbers in the set.\n\nBut wait, let me brainstorm different strategies to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Counting Method:**\n   - Count the total numbers in the set {50, 51, ..., 999}.\n   - Count how many of these are two-digit numbers (i.e., between 50 and 99).\n   - Calculate the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.\n\n2. **Exclusion Method:**\n   - Determine the total set and subtract the numbers that are not two-digit.\n\n3. **Proportion Approach:**\n   - Since two-digit numbers are a small subset, perhaps estimating the proportion could work.\n\n4. **Sample Space Verification:**\n   - List out a sample to verify if the approach makes sense.\n\nI think the **Counting Method** makes the most straightforward sense here. It directly addresses both the numerator (favorable outcomes) and the denominator (total outcomes) without needing to subtract or estimate. Let's try that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Counting the Total Numbers in the Set**\n\n**Thoughts:**\nI need to find how many integers are from 50 to 999, inclusive.\n\n**Calculation:**\nTo find the total number of integers:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Numbers} = 999 - 50 + 1 = 950\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, adding 1 is crucial here because both endpoints (50 and 999) are included. So, 950 seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Counting the Favorable Two-Digit Numbers**\n\n**Thoughts:**\nNow, I need to count how many two-digit numbers are between 50 and 99.\n\n- **Lower Bound:** The smallest two-digit number in our set is 50.\n- **Upper Bound:** The largest two-digit number in our set is 99.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable Outcomes} = 99 - 50 + 1 = 50\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nAdding 1 again to ensure both 50 and 99 are included. So, 50 two-digit numbers make sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thoughts:**\nProbability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{50}{950}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, both numbers are divisible by 50. Let me simplify this fraction.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{950} = \\frac{1}{19}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes \\(\\frac{1}{19}\\) make sense? Let's think about it:\n\n- **Intuition:** If there are 950 total numbers and only 50 are two-digit, then \\(\\frac{50}{950}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{19}\\). That seems plausible.\n- **Quick Check:** \\(\\frac{50}{950}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{19}\\), so the probability is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{19}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:**\nBefore concluding, let me double-check the steps:\n\n1. **Total Numbers Calculation:** \n   \\[\n   999 - 50 + 1 = 950 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Favorable Outcomes Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   99 - 50 + 1 = 50 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Probability Simplification:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{950} = \\frac{1}{19} \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The approach makes sense, and the numbers align logically.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Thoughts:**\nGiven the calculations and verifications, the probability that a randomly selected number from the set is a two-digit number is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy systematically counting both the total and favorable outcomes, simplifying the probability fraction, and verifying each step, we've determined that the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{19}\\). Throughout the process, brainstorming different strategies helped ensure the method was straightforward, and regular reflections confirmed the correctness of each step.",

  "ground_truth": "To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 950 \\}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total. Furthermore, the set $\\{ 50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98, 99 \\}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\\{ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50 \\}$ by subtracting 49. So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$."
