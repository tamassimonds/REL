I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work as I go to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the expression \\(2x^2 - 8\\), I recognize that it's a quadratic expression. Quadratics usually make me think about factoring, but I'm not entirely sure how to start right away. Let me jot down what comes to mind:\n\n- **Factoring out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF):** This is always my first instinct with polynomials. Maybe there's a common factor in both terms that I can pull out.\n  \n- **Difference of Squares:** The expression looks familiar, and I recall that the difference between two squares can be factored in a specific way.\n\n- **Quadratic Formula:** If factoring doesn't work out easily, I know I can use the quadratic formula to find the roots, but that feels a bit excessive for factoring.\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards factoring out the GCF first because it's the simplest method. But I'll keep the other strategies in mind in case GCF doesn't seem to work.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempt to Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**\n\nLet's start by looking for a GCF in \\(2x^2 - 8\\).\n\n- **Identifying Common Factors:**\n    - The coefficients are 2 and 8. The GCF of 2 and 8 is **2**.\n    - Both terms have a **2** as a factor.\n\n- **Factoring Out 2:**\n    \\[\n    2x^2 - 8 = 2(x^2 - 4)\n    \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. I've pulled out the GCF, and now I'm left with \\(x^2 - 4\\). \n\n**Check:** Is \\(x^2 - 4\\) a perfect square or something else? \n\nHmm, \\(x^2 - 4\\) looks familiar. It reminds me of the difference of squares formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Recognizing the Difference of Squares**\n\nNow, I recall that the difference of squares can be factored using the identity:\n\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\n\\]\n\nLooking at \\(x^2 - 4\\), I can see:\n\n- \\(a^2 = x^2\\) \u21d2 \\(a = x\\)\n- \\(b^2 = 4\\) \u21d2 \\(b = 2\\)\n\n**Factoring \\(x^2 - 4\\):**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combining Both Steps**\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n\\[\n2(x^2 - 4) = 2(x - 2)(x + 2)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems to work. I've factored out the GCF and then applied the difference of squares to the remaining expression. \n\n**Check:** Let me multiply it back to see if I get the original expression.\n\n\\[\n2(x - 2)(x + 2) = 2[(x - 2)(x + 2)] = 2(x^2 - 4) = 2x^2 - 8\n\\]\n\nYep, that matches the original expression. So, the factoring looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Verifying by Quadratic Formula**\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider using the quadratic formula to verify.\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(2x^2 - 8 = 0\\):\n\n- \\(a = 2\\)\n- \\(b = 0\\)\n- \\(c = -8\\)\n\n**Calculating the Discriminant:**\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = 0^2 - 4(2)(-8) = 0 + 64 = 64\n\\]\n\n\\(\\sqrt{64} = 8\\)\n\n**Finding the Roots:**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-0 \\pm 8}{4} = \\frac{\\pm 8}{4} = \\pm 2\n\\]\n\n**Interpreting the Roots:**\n\nThe roots are \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = -2\\). This aligns with the factors \\( (x - 2)(x + 2) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUsing the quadratic formula confirms our factoring. It's always good to have multiple methods check out to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies and verifying with an alternative approach, the fully factored form of the expression \\(2x^2 - 8\\) is:\n\n\\[\n2(x - 2)(x + 2)\n\\]\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Factoring the GCF was the initial step** that led to recognizing a familiar pattern (difference of squares).\n- **Alternative methods, like the quadratic formula,** provided verification and ensured the correctness of the factoring.\n- **Reflecting and checking at each step** helped confirm the approach and catch any potential mistakes early on.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, by starting with the GCF, recognizing the difference of squares, and verifying with the quadratic formula, we successfully factored the expression and ensured the solution's accuracy.",
