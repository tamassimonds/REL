    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, emulating a natural thought process with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting, and checking our work frequently. I\u2019ll walk through my initial thoughts, explore various approaches, check for correctness along the way, and adjust strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \n\n\\[\n\\frac{Bx - 11}{x^2 - 7x + 10} = \\frac{A}{x - 2} + \\frac{3}{x - 5}\n\\]\n\nI think about fractions and their denominators. This reminds me of partial fraction decomposition, where we need to express one fraction as the sum of simpler fractions.\n\nBut, honestly, I'm a bit unsure because the left side has a linear numerator over a quadratic denominator, and the right side has separate fractions. It feels like I might need to combine these or perhaps equate coefficients after bringing them to a common denominator.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Approach 1:** Maybe I could bring both sides to a common denominator and then equate the numerators. That might allow me to solve for A and B.\n- **Approach 2:** Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to decompose the left side into partial fractions first and then match them with the right side.\n- **Approach 3:** I could also consider substituting specific values of \\(x\\) to create equations that might help solve for A and B.\n\nHmm, I'm leaning towards **Approach 1**, bringing both sides to a common denominator. But let's see if that works; if not, I'll try partial fractions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Trying Approach 1 \u2013 Common Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s bring both sides to a common denominator to see if equating numerators simplifies the problem.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Identify the Common Denominator:**\n   The denominators are \\(x^2 - 7x + 10\\) on the left and \\(x - 2\\) and \\(x - 5\\) on the right. The common denominator would be the product of the right side's denominators:\n   \\[\n   (x - 2)(x - 5) = x^2 - 7x + 10\n   \\]\n   Wait a minute\u2014this is the same as the left side\u2019s denominator. That\u2019s convenient!\n\n2. **Rewrite the Right Side with Common Denominator:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{A}{x - 2} + \\frac{3}{x - 5} = \\frac{A(x - 5) + 3(x - 2)}{(x - 2)(x - 5)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Right Side:**\n   \\[\n   A(x - 5) + 3(x - 2) = Ax - 5A + 3x - 6\n   \\]\n   Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   (A + 3)x - (5A + 6)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation by Equating Numerators:**\n   Since the denominators are equal, we can equate the numerators:\n   \\[\n   Bx - 11 = (A + 3)x - (5A + 6)\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks promising. We have an equation where the coefficients of \\(x\\) on both sides must be equal, as well as the constant terms. Let\u2019s proceed to solve for A and B.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Equating Coefficients**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll equate the coefficients of \\(x\\) and the constant terms separately to form a system of equations.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   B = A + 3\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Constant Terms:**\n   \\[\n   -11 = - (5A + 6) \\implies -11 = -5A - 6\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   -11 + 6 = -5A \\implies -5 = -5A \\implies A = 1\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, that gives me \\(A = 1\\). Let\u2019s see if that makes sense by checking it against the first equation.\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\nB = A + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(A = 1\\) and \\(B = 4\\). But let\u2019s double-check if these values satisfy the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt\u2019s essential to verify that these values of A and B actually satisfy the original equation. Let\u2019s substitute them back into the equation to check.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Original Equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4x - 11}{x^2 - 7x + 10} = \\frac{1}{x - 2} + \\frac{3}{x - 5}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Left Side:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4x - 11}{(x - 2)(x - 5)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Right Side: Using A = 1, B = 4:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{x - 2} + \\frac{3}{x - 5} = \\frac{(x - 5) + 3(x - 2)}{(x - 2)(x - 5)} = \\frac{x - 5 + 3x - 6}{(x - 2)(x - 5)} = \\frac{4x - 11}{(x - 2)(x - 5)}\n   \\]\n   \n   Both sides are equal!\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe check confirms that \\(A = 1\\) and \\(B = 4\\) are correct. Hence,\n\n\\[\nA + B = 1 + 4 = 5\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAfter verifying, I can confidently say that the sum of A and B is 5. It\u2019s always good to double-check along the way to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nA + B = 5\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the Approach:**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Considered different strategies like common denominator, partial fraction decomposition, and substituting values.\n- **Strategy Selection:** Chose to equate numerators by finding a common denominator, which simplified the problem.\n- **Execution:** Equated coefficients of \\(x\\) and constant terms to form and solve a system of equations.\n- **Verification:** Checked the solution by substituting back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal.\n- **Final Reflection:** Confirmed the correctness of the solution and calculated \\(A + B\\) to be 5.\n\nThroughout the problem, I reflected often, checking if each step made sense and adjusting the approach as needed. This ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We factor the denominator in the left-hand side to get \\[\\frac{Bx - 11}{(x - 2)(x - 5)}= \\frac{A}{x - 2} + \\frac{3}{x - 5}.\\] We then multiply both sides by $(x - 2)(x - 5)$, to get \\[Bx - 11 = A(x - 5) + 3(x - 2).\\] We can solve for $B$ substituting a suitable value of $x$.  For example, setting $x = 5$, the equation becomes $5B - 11 = 9$, so $B = 4$.  Then \\[4x - 11 = A(x - 5) + 3(x - 2).\\] Setting $x = 2$, this equation becomes $-3 = -3A$, so $A = 1$.  Therefore, $A + B = 1 + 4 = \\boxed{5}$."
