    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just as I would if tackling it in real life. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way to ensure we're heading in the right direction.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**When I first see the question:**\n- **Different Strategies That Come to Mind:**\n  - **Calculate the Volume of the Larger Sphere and Subtract the Volume of the Smaller Sphere:** This seems like the most straightforward approach since we're dealing with concentric spheres.\n  - **Use Integrals to Find the Volume Between Two Spheres:** This is a more advanced method, but I recall seeing it used for problems involving spherical shells.\n  - **Visualize the Problem:** Maybe drawing a diagram could help clarify what we\u2019re looking for.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- \"This looks similar to problems I've encountered before where you need to find the volume of a three-dimensional shape by subtracting the volume of one shape from another. So, perhaps calculating the volumes directly is the way to go.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Volume of Each Sphere**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Recall the Formula for the Volume of a Sphere:** I remember the formula is \\( V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\).\n- **Check the Radii:** The radii are 3 units and 6 units for the smaller and larger spheres, respectively.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Volume of the Larger Sphere \\( V_{\\text{large}} \\):**\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 216 = 288 \\pi \\text{ cubic units}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Volume of the Smaller Sphere \\( V_{\\text{small}} \\):**\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 27 = 36 \\pi \\text{ cubic units}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- \"Okay, these volumes make sense. \\(6^3\\) is 216, and multiplying by \\(\\frac{4}{3} \\pi\\) gives 288 \\(\\pi\\). Similarly, \\(3^3\\) is 27, leading to 36 \\(\\pi\\). The calculations seem correct.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Volume of the Region Between the Spheres**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Subtract the Volume of the Smaller Sphere from the Larger Sphere:** This should give us the volume of the region within the larger sphere but outside the smaller sphere.\n- **Check If This Approach Makes Sense:** Since the spheres are concentric, subtracting the smaller volume from the larger one directly gives the volume of the shell-like region between them.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume of the Region} = V_{\\text{large}} - V_{\\text{small}} = 288 \\pi - 36 \\pi = 252 \\pi \\text{ cubic units}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- \"This subtraction looks straightforward. \\(288 \\pi - 36 \\pi\\) equals \\(252 \\pi\\), which seems reasonable. The method aligns with the concept of finding the volume of a spherical shell by subtracting the inner volume from the outer volume.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Checking the Work**\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?** \\(252 \\pi\\) cubic units seems like a plausible volume for the region between two concentric spheres with radii 3 and 6.\n- **Quick Check:** \n  - **Given Radii:** The difference in radii is \\(6 - 3 = 3\\) units. Intuitively, a shell with an outer radius that's twice as large as the inner radius should have a significant volume.\n  - **Volume Ratio:** The volumes should differ proportionally to the cubes of the radii. Since the radii ratio is \\(2:1\\), the volume of the larger sphere should be eight times greater than the smaller one. Let's briefly verify this:\n\n    - **Expected Volume Ratio:** \n      \\[\n      \\left(\\frac{6}{3}\\right)^3 = 2^3 = 8\n      \\]\n    \n    - **Actual Volume Ratio According to Our Calculation:** \n      \\[\n      \\frac{288 \\pi}{36 \\pi} = 8\n      \\]\n    \n    - **Result:** The ratio matches, confirming our calculations are consistent with the geometric relationship between the spheres.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- \"The answer checks out. The volumes align with the expected ratios, and the method used is logical for this type of problem.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using Integrals**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Consider Using Integrals to Find the Volume of the Spherical Shell:** This is a more advanced method and might be useful for verifying our previous calculation.\n- **Reflecting on the Strategy:** While using integrals can provide an exact measurement, it might be overcomplicating things for this straightforward problem where a direct subtraction suffices.\n\n**Calculation Using Integrals:**\n\n1. **Set Up the Integral for the Volume of the Spherical Shell:**\n   \\[\n   V = \\int_{r_1}^{r_2} A(r) \\, dr\n   \\]\n   where \\(A(r)\\) is the area of the cross-section at radius \\(r\\).\n\n2. **Determine \\(A(r)\\):**\n   - **Subtract the Area of the Smaller Sphere from the Area of the Larger Sphere:**\n     \\[\n     A(r) = \\pi r^2 \\quad \\text{(since we're dealing with spherical shells)}\n     \\]\n     But to find the volume of the shell, we consider the difference in volumes:\n\n     \\[\n     V = \\pi\\int_{3}^{6} r^2 \\, dr\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate the Integral:**\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi \\left[ \\frac{r^3}{3} \\right]_{3}^{6} = \\pi \\left( \\frac{216}{3} - \\frac{27}{3} \\right) = \\pi (72 - 9) = 63 \\pi \\text{ cubic units}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Wait, That Can't Be Right!**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Realization:** The volume calculated using integrals is \\(63 \\pi\\), which is significantly less than our previous result of \\(252 \\pi\\).\n- **Checking the Mistake:** Let's examine the integral setup.\n\n**Mistake Identified:**\n- **Incorrect Interpretation:** Using \\(\\pi \\int_{3}^{6} r^2 \\, dr\\) computes the volume of the larger sphere segment, not the difference in volumes between the two spheres.\n- **Solution:** We should be subtracting the volume of the smaller sphere from the larger sphere's volume directly, which we've already done successfully.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- \"This alternative approach led to an inconsistency, likely because the integral setup was misapplied. It's a good reminder that while integrals are powerful tools, they need to be applied correctly. In this case, the direct subtraction method was more straightforward and accurate.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully reflecting on each step and verifying the calculations, the volume of the region within the larger sphere and not within the smaller sphere is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{252 \\pi \\text{ cubic units}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- \"Beginning with brainstorming helped identify the most straightforward strategy\u2014calculating the volumes and subtracting them. Throughout the process, reflecting and checking the work ensured the correctness of the approach. When an alternative method using integrals introduced an inconsistency, it reinforced that the initial method was appropriate for this problem. Emphasizing step-by-step problem-solving, including explorations, mistakes, and validations, led to a confident and accurate solution.\"",
