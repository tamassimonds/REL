    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to check my work, and change my approach if something doesn\u2019t seem right. Let\u2019s make this as human-like as possible, complete with thoughts, doubts, and \u201caha!\u201d moments.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is asking for \\( f(f(1)) \\) where \\( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of composition functions, where you apply a function inside another function. I\u2019ve done similar problems before, so I think I need to find \\( f(1) \\) first and then plug that result back into \\( f(x) \\).\n  \n- **Alternative Idea:** Wait, I could also think about the properties of the function or check if there's a pattern by evaluating \\( f(x) \\) for different values. But honestly, since I need a specific value, starting with finding \\( f(1) \\) seems straightforward.\n\n- **Check Point:** Before proceeding, let me ensure that \\( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \\) is clear. It's a quadratic function, and I remember quadratics can have interesting properties, but for this problem, composition is the key.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Find \\( f(1) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlright, let's start by finding \\( f(1) \\). This seems like the natural first step.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(1) = 3(1)^2 - 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 3 \\times 1 - 5 = 3 - 5 = -2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so \\( f(1) = -2 \\). That makes sense. I plugged in 1 into the quadratic function, and the calculation looks correct. \n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does \\( 3(1)^2 - 5 \\) equal -2? Yes, because \\( 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\) and \\( 3 - 5 = -2 \\).\n  \n- No issues here, so I'll proceed to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Find \\( f(f(1)) = f(-2) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow I need to find \\( f(-2) \\). This is where composition comes into play. I\u2019ll substitute -2 into the original function.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(-2) = 3(-2)^2 - 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 3 \\times 4 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, \\( f(-2) = 7 \\). Let me verify the steps:\n\n- Squaring -2 gives 4.\n- Multiplying by 3 gives 12.\n- Subtracting 5 gives 7.\n\n**Check Point:**\n\n- Does \\( 3(-2)^2 - 5 \\) equal 7? Yes, because \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\) and \\( 12 - 5 = 7 \\).\n- Everything checks out, so the calculation is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore concluding, let\u2019s double-check if everything aligns with the problem's requirements. Does \\( f(f(1)) \\) indeed equal 7?\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Re-evaluate \\( f(1) \\):** Confirmed \\( f(1) = -2 \\).\n- **Re-evaluate \\( f(-2) \\):** Confirmed \\( f(-2) = 7 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth steps lead logically from one to the other, and the computations are verified. \n\n**Random Insight:**\n\n- **Pattern Check:** I remember that composing functions can sometimes simplify to a single expression if there\u2019s a pattern. But since we're dealing with specific values here, it might not be necessary.\n\n- **Alternative Method:** I could have expressed \\( f(f(x)) \\) in terms of a single expression and then substituted \\( x = 1 \\), but that seems more complicated for this specific problem.\n\n**Correctness Check:**\n\n- All calculations are coherent.\n- The composition is handled correctly.\n- The final answer \\( f(f(1)) = 7 \\) aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully following each step and verifying the calculations, the value of \\( f(f(1)) \\) is **7**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout the process:\n\n- **Brainstorming Helped:** Initially thinking about different strategies ensured I chose the most straightforward path.\n  \n- **Checking Was Crucial:** Regular checks confirmed the accuracy of each step.\n  \n- **Flexibility in Approach:** Being open to changing methods prevented potential mistakes.\n\n- **Human-Like Thinking:** Emulating natural thought processes with doubts and confirmations led to a reliable solution.\n\nBy mimicking a human's problem-solving approach\u2014complete with brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and being ready to adapt\u2014we arrive confidently at the correct answer.\n\nAhh, there it is. I almost got tripped up thinking about the composition of functions, but then I remembered the order of operations is key here. Let me retrace my steps to ensure everything aligns correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting the Problem**\n\nYou asked for the value of \\( f(f(1)) \\) given that \\( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \\). Initially, I approached it by finding \\( f(1) \\) and then \\( f(f(1)) \\). Let's see if that method holds up or if I need to adjust my strategy.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Main Goal:** Determine \\( f(f(1)) \\).\n- **Composition Understanding:** I recall that function composition requires applying the inner function first, followed by the outer function. So, I should be careful about the order.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - Find \\( f(1) \\) and then \\( f \\) evaluated at that result.\n  - Alternatively, express \\( f(f(x)) \\) more generally and then substitute \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nI initially went with the first strategy, but let\u2019s ensure it\u2019s the most efficient and correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Confirming \\( f(1) \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s start by verifying my earlier calculation:\n\n\\[\nf(1) = 3(1)^2 - 5 = 3 \\times 1 - 5 = 3 - 5 = -2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Does this match my previous result? Yes, \\( f(1) = -2 \\).\n- **Conclusion:** The first step is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Re-evaluating \\( f(f(1)) = f(-2) \\)**\n\nNow, let's find \\( f(-2) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(-2) = 3(-2)^2 - 5 = 3 \\times 4 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Squaring -2 gives 4, multiplying by 3 gives 12, and subtracting 5 results in 7. This aligns with my earlier calculation.\n- **Consistency:** The result remains unchanged, confirming the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Expressing \\( f(f(x)) \\)**\n\nTo ensure completeness, let\u2019s consider another method:\n\n1. **Define \\( f(f(x)) \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   f(f(x)) = f(3x^2 - 5)\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute \\( f(x) \\) into itself:**\n   \n   \\[\n   f(f(x)) = 3(3x^2 - 5)^2 - 5\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Simplify the expression:**\n   \n   \\[\n   = 3(9x^4 - 30x^2 + 25) - 5\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   = 27x^4 - 90x^2 + 75 - 5\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   = 27x^4 - 90x^2 + 70\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Substitute \\( x = 1 \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   f(f(1)) = 27(1)^4 - 90(1)^2 + 70 = 27 - 90 + 70 = 7\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Comparison:** Both methods yield the same result, \\( f(f(1)) = 7 \\).\n- **Verification:** This alternative approach confirms the accuracy of the initial steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter re-evaluating and verifying both methods, the value of \\( f(f(1)) \\) is **7**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Initially considered different strategies and chose the most direct path.\n- **Checking and Verifying:** Regularly confirmed each step\u2019s correctness, which caught any potential missteps early.\n- **Flexibility:** Being open to re-evaluating and applying an alternative method ensured the solution's accuracy.\n- **Human-Like Thinking:** Emulated natural problem-solving with doubts, reflections, and confirmations, leading to a confident conclusion.\n\nBy thoughtfully navigating through brainstorming, checking, and adapting strategies, we arrive at the correct and verified solution.",
