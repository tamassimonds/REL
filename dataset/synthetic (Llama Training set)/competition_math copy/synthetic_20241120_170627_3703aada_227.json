I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work as I go\u2014just like tackling a real-world problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the question, **Find the sum of all positive integral values of \\( n \\) for which \\( \\frac{n + 6}{n} \\) is an integer**, a few initial thoughts come to mind:\n\n- **Fraction Simplification:** This looks like a fraction that could simplify. Maybe I can reduce it somehow to see the integers involved more clearly.\n- **Integer Condition:** The fact that \\( \\frac{n + 6}{n} \\) must be an integer suggests that the denominator \\( n \\) divides the numerator \\( n + 6 \\) evenly.\n- **Possible Values for \\( n \\):** I need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy this condition.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Simplifying the fraction seems like a good idea, but I'll need to ensure that approach leads me to the right path.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Fraction Simplification:**\n   - Simplify \\( \\frac{n + 6}{n} \\) to see if it reveals something about \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Set Up an Equation:**\n   - Let \\( k = \\frac{n + 6}{n} \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer. This implies \\( n \\) divides \\( n + 6 \\).\n\n3. **Explore Divisibility:**\n   - Since \\( n \\) divides \\( n + 6 \\), maybe I can set up a divisibility condition: \\( n | 6 \\) (meaning \\( n \\) is a divisor of 6).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplifying the Fraction**\n\nLet's start with the first idea: simplifying \\( \\frac{n + 6}{n} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n + 6}{n} = \\frac{n}{n} + \\frac{6}{n} = 1 + \\frac{6}{n}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, so \\( \\frac{n + 6}{n} = 1 + \\frac{6}{n} \\). For this to be an integer, \\( \\frac{6}{n} \\) must also be an integer. This means that \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 6. **That makes sense!** If \\( n \\) divides 6, then \\( \\frac{6}{n} \\) is an integer, and so is \\( \\frac{n + 6}{n} \\).\n\n**Check:** Wait, let me quickly verify. If \\( n \\) is a divisor of 6, then \\( \\frac{6}{n} \\) is an integer. Adding 1 to an integer results in another integer, so \\( \\frac{n + 6}{n} \\) is indeed an integer. **I think this works.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Divisors of 6**\n\nNow that I know \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 6, let\u2019s list the positive divisors of 6:\n\n- The positive divisors of 6 are: \\( 1, 2, 3, 6 \\).\n\n**Thought Process:** **Wait, is that all?** Let me double-check to ensure I'm not missing any positive divisors. **Yep, 1, 2, 3, and 6 are the only positive integers that divide 6 evenly.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Sum of Valid \\( n \\) Values**\n\nThe question asks for the **sum of all positive integral values of \\( n \\)** that satisfy the condition. So, I\u2019ll add up all the positive divisors of 6:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** **That seems straightforward.** By identifying the divisors of 6, I can easily sum them up to find the answer. But let me double-check\u2014are there any other positive integers I might have overlooked? **Nope, I think I've covered all the possible \\( n \\) values.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, it's always good to verify if the approach works for all possible cases:\n\n- **For \\( n = 1 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1 + 6}{1} = \\frac{7}{1} = 7 \\quad (\\text{Integer})\n  \\]\n- **For \\( n = 2 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2 + 6}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\quad (\\text{Integer})\n  \\]\n- **For \\( n = 3 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3 + 6}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\quad (\\text{Integer})\n  \\]\n- **For \\( n = 6 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{6 + 6}{6} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\quad (\\text{Integer})\n  \\]\n\n**Check:** **All these calculations yield integers.** This confirms that each positive divisor of 6 satisfies the condition \\( \\frac{n + 6}{n} \\) being an integer. **So, the approach is correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nInitially, I considered simplifying the fraction and setting up a divisibility condition. By recognizing that \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 6, I identified all positive integral values of \\( n \\) as \\( 1, 2, 3, \\) and \\( 6 \\). Summing these divisors gives:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:** **Does this answer make sense?** The sum of all positive divisors of 6 is indeed 12, and all these divisors satisfy the given condition. **I'm confident that this is the correct answer.**\n\n---\n\n**Ahh Moments:** During the simplification step, I realized that identifying \\( n \\) as a divisor of 6 was key to solving the problem. Initially, I wasn't sure if there might be other strategies, but focusing on divisors streamlined the process. **This approach felt natural and led me directly to the solution.**\n\n**Conclusion:** By brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, verifying the approach, and checking the work, I've arrived at the correct answer: **12.**",

  "ground_truth": "The expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ can be simplified as $\\frac{n}{n}+\\frac{6}{n}$, or $1+\\frac{6}{n}$. So in order for this expression to have an integral value, 6 must be divisible by $n$. Therefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ is just the sum of all the divisors of $6$. Since the prime factorization of 6 is $2\\cdot3$, we know that 6 is only divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, and the final answer is $1+2+3+6=\\boxed{12}$."
