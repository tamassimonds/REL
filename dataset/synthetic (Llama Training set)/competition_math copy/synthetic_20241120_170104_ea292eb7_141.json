    "working_out": "First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem\n\nOkay, let's dive into this problem. The question gives me an equation involving two positive real numbers, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\): \n\n\\[ a + 2b = 1. \\]\n\nI need to find the minimum value of \n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b}. \\]\n\nAt first glance, this looks like an optimization problem with a constraint, which reminds me of problems where I might use techniques like AM-GM inequality, Lagrange multipliers, or perhaps substitution. It\u2019s a familiar type of problem, but I\u2019m not entirely sure which approach will work best right away.\n\nBrainstorming Strategies:\n\n1. **AM-GM Inequality:** I recall that the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality is often used to relate the means of numbers and could help here since I\u2019m dealing with sums and reciprocals.\n\n2. **Substitution:** Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other using the given equation and then substitute it into the expression to minimize.\n\n3. **Lagrange Multipliers:** This is a method from calculus for optimizing functions subject to constraints. It feels a bit advanced, but could be applicable.\n\n4. **Calculus Approach:** Taking derivatives to find critical points might work since I\u2019m dealing with real numbers.\n\nNow, let\u2019s explore these strategies one by one, starting with the AM-GM inequality, since it\u2019s a straightforward application for problems involving sums and reciprocals.\n\n**Step 1: Attempting AM-GM Inequality**\n\nI know that the AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean of non-negative numbers is greater than or equal to their geometric mean. \n\nLet\u2019s apply this idea to the given constraint: \n\n\\[ a + 2b = 1. \\]\n\nI can try to relate \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{b} \\) using AM-GM. Specifically, I would look to minimize the sum \\( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} \\) by finding a relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) that satisfies the constraint.\n\n**Reflection on This Approach:**\n\nWait, AM-GM might not be directly applicable here because the inequality typically relates means of the same type, and here I have different terms (\\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{b} \\)). Perhaps I need a different strategy.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:**\n\nHmm, maybe AM-GM isn\u2019t the best starting point because it doesn't directly connect the given constraint to the expression I want to minimize.\n\n**Step 2: Exploring Substitution**\n\nSince AM-GM didn\u2019t seem promising, let\u2019s try substitution. I can use the constraint to express one variable in terms of the other.\n\nFrom the equation \\( a + 2b = 1 \\), I can solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = 1 - 2b. \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into the expression to minimize:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1 - 2b} + \\frac{2}{b}. \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, this looks like a valid approach. Now I\u2019m dealing with a single variable \\( b \\), which makes it easier to apply calculus methods to find the minimum.\n\n**Step 3: Taking Derivatives to Find Minimum**\n\nLet\u2019s differentiate the function with respect to \\( b \\) to find the critical points.\n\nThe function to minimize is:\n\n\\[ f(b) = \\frac{1}{1 - 2b} + \\frac{2}{b}. \\]\n\nTaking the derivative:\n\n\\[ f'(b) = -\\frac{2}{(1 - 2b)^2} - \\frac{2}{b^2}. \\]\n\nSet \\( f'(b) = 0 \\) to find critical points:\n\n\\[ -\\frac{2}{(1 - 2b)^2} - \\frac{2}{b^2} = 0. \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this looks messy. Maybe instead of solving this complicated equation, I can think if there\u2019s a simpler way to find the minimum, perhaps by checking specific values or using another inequality.\n\n**Step 4: Switch Back to AM-GM with a Different Insight**\n\nWait, maybe I can use AM-GM in a different way. The expression I want to minimize is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b}. \\]\n\nThe constraint is \\( a + 2b = 1 \\). \n\nLet\u2019s try to combine these two ideas. We can write:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} = \\frac{1}{a} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{b}. \\]\n\nNow, apply AM-GM to \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{b} \\):\n\n\\[ \\text{AM} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{a} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{b}}{2} \\geq \\text{GM} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a} \\times 2 \\times \\frac{1}{b}}. \\]\n\nWait, I need to express the AM in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to relate it to the constraint. Let\u2019s see if this helps.\n\n**Conclusion for This Approach:**\n\nI\u2019m realizing that while AM-GM might help, I still need to relate it directly to the constraint \\( a + 2b = 1 \\). It\u2019s not straightforward, so perhaps I need to combine AM-GM with substitution.\n\n**Step 5: Combining Substitution and AM-GM**\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\( a = 1 - 2b \\) into our inequality.\n\nGiven the constraint, let\u2019s apply AM-GM to:\n\n\\[ 1 = a + 2b \\geq 3\\sqrt[3]{a(2b)^2} \\]\n\nBut this seems a bit off. Maybe I should instead focus on minimizing \\( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} \\) by substituting \\( a = 1 - 2b \\) and then apply calculus.\n\n**Step 6: Simplifying the Function to Minimize**\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the function:\n\n\\[ f(b) = \\frac{1}{1 - 2b} + \\frac{2}{b}. \\]\n\nThis function is defined for \\( b > 0 \\) and \\( 1 - 2b > 0 \\), which implies \\( b < \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSince I\u2019m looking for the minimum value, I should consider the boundaries and critical points within this domain.\n\n**Step 7: Finding Critical Points Again**\n\nLet\u2019s set up the derivative again:\n\n\\[ f'(b) = -\\frac{2}{(1 - 2b)^2} - \\frac{2}{b^2} = 0. \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{(1 - 2b)^2} = \\frac{2}{b^2}, \\]\n\nwhich leads to:\n\n\\[ (1 - 2b)^2 = b^2. \\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[ 1 - 2b = b \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 1 - 2b = -b. \\]\n\nSolving these equations:\n\n1. \\( 1 - 2b = b \\) \u2192 \\( 1 = 3b \\) \u2192 \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n2. \\( 1 - 2b = -b \\) \u2192 \\( 1 = b \\) \u2192 \\( b = 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, \\( b = 1 \\) isn\u2019t within our valid range \\( b < \\frac{1}{2} \\). So, the only critical point within the valid range is \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Step 8: Calculating Corresponding \\( a \\) and Evaluating the Function**\n\nNow, substitute \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\) back into the constraint to find \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = 1 - 2 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}. \\]\n\nNow, evaluate the expression to minimize:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3}} + \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 3 + 6 = 9. \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis value seems reasonable, but let\u2019s check if it\u2019s indeed the minimum by considering the boundaries and possibly applying the second derivative test.\n\n**Step 9: Checking the Boundaries and Second Derivative Test**\n\nSince \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive real numbers, we have \\( b < \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( a = 1 - 2b > 0 \\). \n\nLet\u2019s consider what happens as \\( b \\) approaches \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} \\rightarrow \\infty \\quad \\text{as} \\quad b \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}. \\]\n\nThus, the function tends to infinity at the boundary, indicating that the minimum should occur at the critical point \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nNext, let\u2019s check the second derivative to confirm that \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\) is indeed a minimum:\n\n\\[ f''(b) = \\frac{4}{(1 - 2b)^3} + \\frac{4}{b^3}. \\]\n\nEvaluate at \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ f''\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{(1 - \\frac{2}{3})^3} + \\frac{4}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3} = \\frac{4}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3} + \\frac{4}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3} = 108 + 108 = 216. \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe second derivative is positive, which confirms that \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\) is a minimum point.\n\n**Step 10: Final Answer**\n\nHaving confirmed through critical points and the second derivative test that \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\) and \\( a = \\frac{1}{3} \\) yield the minimum value, we conclude that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} = 9. \\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- Initially, I thought AM-GM might be the way to go, but it didn\u2019t directly apply, leading me to consider substitution.\n- Substitution helped simplify the problem to a single-variable function, making it manageable.\n- Calculus was effective in finding the critical point, and checking the second derivative confirmed it was a minimum.\n- Throughout, reflecting on each step ensured that the approach was correct and adjustments were made when something didn\u2019t seem right.\n\nBy carefully exploring different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and verifying each step, I arrived at the correct minimum value of 9.",
