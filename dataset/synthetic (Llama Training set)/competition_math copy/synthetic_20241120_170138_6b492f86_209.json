    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking if I'm on the right track, and adjusting my approach as needed. It's important to think out loud and let the thought process flow naturally, just like tackling a problem in real life.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-9x}{x^2-1} = \\frac{2x}{x+1} - \\frac{6}{x-1}\n\\]\n\nI remember dealing with rational equations before. They often require finding a common denominator or cross-multiplying to eliminate fractions. But honestly, I'm also a bit unsure because there are multiple fractions on both sides, which can get messy.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Common Denominator Approach:** Find a common denominator for all the fractions to combine them into a single equation.\n   \n2. **Cross-Multiplication:** Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions, which might simplify the equation.\n\n3. **Separate Each Fraction:** Simplify each fraction individually before combining them to see if it reduces complexity.\n\n4. **Factorization:** Look for factors that might cancel out, reducing the equation before solving.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI'm leaning towards starting with **cross-multiplication** because it typically straightforwardly eliminates fractions. But I'll keep the common denominator approach in mind if that doesn't work out.\n\n### **Step 1: Attempt Cross-Multiplication**\n\nLet's try cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-9x}{x^2-1} = \\frac{2x}{x+1} - \\frac{6}{x-1}\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the right side so it's easier to handle. Notice that \\( \\frac{2x}{x+1} - \\frac{6}{x-1} \\) can be combined into a single fraction by finding a common denominator.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis reminds me of adding fractions in elementary math. To combine \\( \\frac{2x}{x+1} \\) and \\( \\frac{6}{x-1} \\), I need a common denominator, which would be \\( (x+1)(x-1) \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{x+1} = \\frac{2x(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)} = \\frac{2x^2 - 2x}{(x+1)(x-1)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{x-1} = \\frac{6(x+1)}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \\frac{6x + 6}{(x-1)(x+1)}\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract the two fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x^2 - 2x - (6x + 6)}{(x+1)(x-1)} = \\frac{2x^2 - 2x - 6x - 6}{(x+1)(x-1)} = \\frac{2x^2 - 8x - 6}{(x+1)(x-1)}\n\\]\n\nSo the right side becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x^2 - 8x - 6}{(x+1)(x-1)}\n\\]\n\nNow the equation looks like:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-9x}{x^2-1} = \\frac{2x^2 - 8x - 6}{(x+1)(x-1)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a moment... both sides have similar denominators. In fact, \\( x^2 - 1 = (x+1)(x-1) \\). That realization makes me think there's a simplification here.\n\n### **Step 2: Simplify the Equation**\n\nGiven that both denominators are the same, we can set the numerators equal to each other, assuming \\( x \\neq \\pm 1 \\) (to avoid division by zero).\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-9x = 2x^2 - 8x - 6\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis looks much cleaner! Now, I have a quadratic equation to solve. I remember that setting the equation to zero makes it easier to find the roots.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's move all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 8x - 6 + 9x = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + x - 6 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow, I have a standard quadratic equation. From here, I can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Factoring seems like a good first attempt unless it looks too complex.\n\n### **Step 3: Attempt Factoring the Quadratic**\n\nLet\u2019s try to factor \\( 2x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo factor, I need two numbers that multiply to \\( 2 \\times (-6) = -12 \\) and add up to \\( 1 \\) (the coefficient of \\( x \\)).\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nHmm, looking for factors of \\(-12\\) that add up to \\( 1 \\). Let me list them:\n\n- \\( 1 \\times (-12) = -12 \\) (sum = -11)\n- \\( 2 \\times (-6) = -12 \\) (sum = -4)\n- \\( 3 \\times (-4) = -12 \\) (sum = -1)\n- \\(-1 \\times 12 = 12\\) (sum = 11)\n- \\(-2 \\times 6 = 12\\) (sum = 4)\n- \\(-3 \\times 4 = 12\\) (sum = 1)\n\n**Realization:**  \nOh! The pair \\(-3\\) and \\(4\\) add up to \\(1\\). Perfect!\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSo, we can rewrite the middle term using these numbers:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x + 4x - 6 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, group the terms:\n\n\\[\n(2x^2 - 3x) + (4x - 6) = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out the common factors in each group:\n\n\\[\nx(2x - 3) + 2(2x - 3) = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\( (2x - 3) \\):\n\n\\[\n(2x - 3)(x + 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks good! Now, I can set each factor equal to zero to find the solutions for \\( x \\).\n\n### **Step 4: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\nSet each factor to zero:\n\n1. \\( 2x - 3 = 0 \\)\n\n   \\[\n   2x = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. \\( x + 2 = 0 \\)\n\n   \\[\n   x = -2\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the potential solutions are \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). Before finalizing, it\u2019s important to **check** if these values make the original equation valid (i.e., they don\u2019t cause division by zero).\n\n### **Step 5: Check Solutions in the Original Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) back into the original equation to verify.\n\n**Checking \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\):**\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-9(\\frac{3}{2})}{(\\frac{3}{2})^2 - 1} = \\frac{2(\\frac{3}{2})}{\\frac{3}{2} + 1} - \\frac{6}{\\frac{3}{2} - 1}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-\\frac{27}{2}}{\\frac{9}{4} - 1} = \\frac{-\\frac{27}{2}}{\\frac{9}{4} - \\frac{4}{4}} = \\frac{-\\frac{27}{2}}{\\frac{5}{4}} = -\\frac{27}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = -\\frac{54}{10} = -\\frac{27}{5}\n\\]\n\nRight side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2(\\frac{3}{2})}{\\frac{3}{2} + 1} - \\frac{6}{\\frac{3}{2} - 1} = \\frac{3}{\\frac{5}{2}} - \\frac{6}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{5} - \\frac{6 \\times 2}{1} = \\frac{6}{5} - 12 = \\frac{6 - 60}{5} = \\frac{-54}{5} = -\\frac{27}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBoth sides are equal: \\( -\\frac{27}{5} = -\\frac{27}{5} \\). So, \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) is a valid solution.\n\n**Checking \\( x = -2 \\):**\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-9(-2)}{(-2)^2 - 1} = \\frac{2(-2)}{-2 + 1} - \\frac{6}{-2 - 1}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{4 - 1} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nRight side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-4}{-1} - \\frac{6}{-3} = 4 + 2 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBoth sides are equal: \\( 6 = 6 \\). So, \\( x = -2 \\) is also a valid solution.\n\n### **Step 6: Sum of All Valid Solutions**\n\nNow that we've verified both solutions are valid, let's find the sum of all \\( x \\) that satisfy the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -2\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2} + (-2) = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{4}{2} = \\frac{3 - 4}{2} = \\frac{-1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the sum of all \\( x \\) that satisfy the equation is \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\). Everything checks out along the way, and the solutions fit back into the original equation perfectly.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- Starting with cross-multiplication helped streamline the process by simplifying the equation early on.\n- Recognizing that both sides had the same denominator was a key insight that led to setting the numerators equal, making it easier to solve.\n- Factoring the quadratic was straightforward once the equation was simplified, and checking each solution ensured their validity.\n- Throughout, reflecting on each step and verifying calculations ensured accuracy and corrected any missteps early in the process.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, complete with brainstorming, checking, and reflecting, led to the correct sum of the solutions: \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Factoring on the left side gives \\[ \\frac{-9x}{(x+1)(x-1)} = \\frac{2x}{x+1} - \\frac{6}{x-1} \\]Then, we multiply both sides of the equation by $(x+1)(x-1)$, which gives \\[-9x = 2x(x-1)-6(x+1).\\]This equation simplifies to $2x^2 + x - 6 = 0$.  We can factor this equation as $(x + 2)(2x-3) = 0$ so that $x = -2$ and $x = \\frac{3}{2}$. We check that they are not -1 or 1, which are excluded from the domain, and they aren't. The sum of the solutions is $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$."
