It's important to show the thought process, including exploring various approaches, checking for correctness, and adjusting methods as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Exploring the Problem**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1 + i}{1 - i} \\right)^{1000}\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Complex Numbers:** I see **i**, which reminds me that we're dealing with complex numbers. \n- **Powers and Exponents:** Raising something to the 1000th power seems huge! Maybe there's a simplification that can make this manageable.\n- **Proportions:** The fraction has the same denominator in the numerator and denominator, which typically hints at using properties of complex conjugates or polar forms.\n- **Similarity to Trigonometric Identities:** The numerator and denominator both involve 1 and i, reminiscent of Euler's formula or trigonometric identities.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Rationalizing the Denominator:** Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to simplify the fraction.\n2. **Using Euler's Formula:** Express the complex number in exponential form to harness properties of exponents.\n3. **De Moivre's Theorem:** Since we're raising it to a high power, maybe this theorem could apply once in exponential form.\n4. **Checking for Roots of Unity:** Although not directly obvious, perhaps the expression relates to roots of unity, given the large exponent.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Rationalizing Might Help:** Rationalizing seems like a straightforward starting point. If that simplifies the fraction significantly, it might make the exponentiation easier.\n- **Exponential Approach:** If rationalizing doesn't simplify enough, converting to exponential form via Euler's formula might reveal patterns.\n- **Check Multiple Paths:** It's good to try rationalizing first; if it gets too cumbersome, switching to the exponential approach would be wise.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Rationalize the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start by rationalizing the denominator to see if the fraction simplifies neatly.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nMultiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator \\(1 + i\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + i}{1 - i} \\times \\frac{1 + i}{1 + i} = \\frac{(1 + i)(1 + i)}{(1 - i)(1 + i)}\n\\]\n\n**Simplify the Denominator:**\n\n\\[\n(1 - i)(1 + i) = 1^2 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2\n\\]\n\n**Simplify the Numerator:**\n\n\\[\n(1 + i)(1 + i) = 1^2 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i\n\\]\n\n**Result After Rationalizing:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2i}{2} = i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Simplification Achieved:** The fraction simplifies to just \\(i\\). This is unexpected but helpful because now we have a simple base to raise to a large power.\n- **Checked for Accuracy:** Multiplying and simplifying both parts seems correct. The denominator cleanly becomes 2, and the numerator simplifies to 2i, which reduces to i.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Raising \\(i\\) to the 1000th Power**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\(i^{1000}\\). Remembering properties of exponents and maybe patterns in powers of \\(i\\) would be helpful here.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nRecall the cyclical nature of powers of \\(i\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ni^1 & = i \\\\\ni^2 & = -1 \\\\\ni^3 & = -i \\\\\ni^4 & = 1 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Recognizing the Pattern:**\n\nThe powers of \\(i\\) repeat every four:\n\n- \\(i^1 = i\\)\n- \\(i^2 = -1\\)\n- \\(i^3 = -i\\)\n- \\(i^4 = 1\\)\n- Then \\(i^5 = i\\), and so on.\n\n**Determining \\(i^{1000}\\):**\n\nTo find \\(i^{1000}\\), divide 1000 by 4 and look at the remainder:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\div 4 = 250 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 0\n\\]\n\nAccording to the pattern:\n\n\\[\ni^{1000} = i^0 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Pattern Utilization:** Using the cycle of powers was efficient. Instead of calculating \\(i^{1000}\\) directly, recognizing the repeating pattern saved a lot of work.\n- **Correctness Check:** Double-checking the pattern confirms that every multiple of 4 returns to 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Final Answer**\n\n**Result:**\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1 + i}{1 - i} \\right)^{1000} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait, so simplifying the fraction first led directly to \\(i\\), and recognizing the pattern in powers of \\(i\\) brought us to 1. That was unexpected but satisfying\u2014the problem simplified beautifully.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Reevaluation:** Initially, the exponent seemed daunting, but breaking it down step by step led to a simple solution.\n- **Validation:** Checking each step confirms the correctness:\n  - Rationalizing simplified the fraction correctly.\n  - Understanding the cyclical nature of \\(i\\) allowed for easy exponentiation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies and starting with rationalizing the denominator, we simplified the expression significantly. This led to recognizing the pattern in powers of \\(i\\), enabling us to calculate \\(i^{1000}\\) efficiently. Throughout the process, reflecting and checking each step ensured accuracy, demonstrating the value of a methodical, thoughtful approach to problem-solving.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration mirrors a human thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflections, and corrections, making it clear how the solution was reached.",
