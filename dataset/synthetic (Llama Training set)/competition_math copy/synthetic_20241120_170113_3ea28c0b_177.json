    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and approach it step by step. I'll brainstorm various strategies, reflect on each step to ensure correctness, and adjust my methods as needed. I'll write out my thought process just like I would if I were tackling this problem on my own, including exploring different paths, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the question, it asks for the probability that a randomly chosen number from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 24\\}\\) is a factor of \\(4!\\). \n\n- **Brainstorming:** \n  - I need to identify the factors of \\(4!\\).\n  - Then, determine how many of these factors are within the given set (1 to 24).\n  - Finally, calculate the probability by comparing the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **List All Factors:**\n   - Write down all the factors of \\(4!\\) and see which ones fall within 1 to 24.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Use the prime factorization of \\(4!\\) to determine its factors more systematically.\n\n3. **Use Divisibility Rules:**\n   - Apply divisibility rules to see which numbers in the set are factors of \\(4!\\).\n\n**Checking Strategy:**\n\nI think listing all factors might be straightforward, but it could be error-prone if I miss any. Prime factorization might give me a more organized way to find all factors. Let's start with prime factorization to see if it aligns better, and if not, we'll adjust.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating \\(4!\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Recall:** \\(n!\\) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \\(n\\).\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes \\(4! = 24\\) make sense? Yes, because:\n\\[\n4 \\times 3 = 12 \\\\\n12 \\times 2 = 24 \\\\\n24 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, \\(4! = 24\\). That simplifies things because now I just need to find the factors of 24.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding Factors of 24 Using Prime Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Brainstorming:**\n  - Prime factorization involves breaking down a number into its prime components.\n  - For 24, I need to see which primes multiply to give 24.\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  \\[\n  24 = 2 \\times 12 \\\\\n  12 = 3 \\times 4 \\\\\n  4 = 2 \\times 2 \\\\\n  \\text{So, } 24 = 2^3 \\times 3^1\n  \\]\n\n**Checking This Approach:**\n\nDoes prime factorization make sense here? Yes, because knowing the prime factors helps in identifying all divisors.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, so 24 is composed of \\(2^3\\) and \\(3^1\\). This will help in listing all factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Listing All Factors of 24**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Brainstorming:**\n  - Factors can be found by multiplying different combinations of prime factors.\n  - Alternatively, I could list all numbers up to 24 and see which ones divide 24 evenly.\n\n- **Calculation Using Prime Factorization:**\n  - From \\(2^0 \\times 3^0 = 1\\) to \\(2^3 \\times 3^1 = 24\\).\n  - Here are the combinations:\n    - \\(2^0 \\times 3^0 = 1\\)\n    - \\(2^1 \\times 3^0 = 2\\)\n    - \\(2^2 \\times 3^0 = 4\\)\n    - \\(2^3 \\times 3^0 = 8\\)\n    - \\(2^0 \\times 3^1 = 3\\)\n    - \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 = 6\\)\n    - \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 = 12\\)\n    - \\(2^3 \\times 3^1 = 24\\)\n\n- **List of Factors:**\n  \\[\n  \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\\}\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nAre these all the factors of 24? Yes, because each factor divides 24 without leaving a remainder.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis list seems complete. I can also verify by checking that all combinations of prime factors are included.\n\nHold on a moment\u2014let me double-check if there are other possible combinations I might have missed.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nWait, I didn't include \\(2^3\\) and \\(3^1\\) separately as higher powers of primes beyond what's needed for 24. But in listing combinations, they naturally emerge.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSo, the factors are indeed \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,\\) and \\(24\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying Favorable Outcomes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Brainstorming:**\n  - Among the factors listed, I need to see which ones are within the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 24\\}\\).\n  - Luckily, all factors of 24 are within this range since 24 is the highest number in the set.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat makes it simple\u2014every factor of 24 is within 1 to 24.\n\n**But Wait:**\n\nLet me ensure there are no factors above 24. Since 24 itself is the highest in our list of factors, we\u2019re good.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Brainstorming:**\n  - Probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n  - Here, favorable outcomes are the factors of 24 within 1 to 24, and the total outcomes are 24 (the numbers 1 to 24).\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of favorable outcomes} = 8 \\, (\\text{factors: } 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24) \\\\\n  \\text{Total possible outcomes} = 24 \\\\\n  \\text{Probability} = \\frac{8}{24} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) seem reasonable? Let\u2019s see\u20148 factors out of 24 is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), which makes sense proportionally.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe probability is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). This seems logical, considering that factors of 24 are a subset of the total numbers up to 24.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Checking Work:**\n  - All factors of 24 were correctly identified.\n  - Each factor is within the range 1 to 24.\n  - The probability calculation aligns with the definitions of probability.\n\n- **Is This Approach Correct?**\n  - Yes, prime factorization helped in systematically identifying all factors.\n  - Listing factors was straightforward since all were within the given set.\n  - The probability formula was applied correctly.\n\n- **Alternative Methods Considered:**\n  - Listing all numbers from 1 to 24 and checking divisibility could work but would be more tedious.\n  - Using divisibility rules might have been faster but less organized than prime factorization.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe probability that the number chosen is a factor of \\(4!\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n---\n\nAlright, I\u2019ve walked through identifying the question, calculating \\(4!\\), finding its factors through prime factorization, and determining the probability step by step. By reflecting and checking each part, I'm confident that the probability is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).",
