    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, thinking through it as a human would. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work often, and adjusting my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, so the problem is about adding the same number to both the numerator and denominator of the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) to make it equivalent to \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\). \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of solving proportion problems where two fractions need to be equal. \n- **Possible Strategies:** I could set up an equation to represent this relationship, or perhaps use cross-multiplication since it's about equivalence. \n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure if cross-multiplication is the best starting point. Maybe setting up an equation would give me a clearer path.\n\n**Let\u2019s Brainstorm:**\n\n1. **Set Up an Equation:** Let \\(x\\) be the number added. Then \\(\\frac{3 + x}{5 + x} = \\frac{5}{6}\\).\n   \n2. **Cross-Multiplication:** Multiply both sides to eliminate the fractions.\n\n3. **Check if Simplifying Works:** See if simplifying \\(\\frac{3 + x}{5 + x}\\) directly helps.\n\n**Which Approach to Try First?**\n\nI think setting up an equation looks straightforward. If that gets messy, I can always switch to cross-multiplication. Let\u2019s start with the equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s define \\(x\\) as the number to be added. The equation representing the problem is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3 + x}{5 + x} = \\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting on This Approach:**\n\n- **Is This Correct?** At first glance, this seems logical because it directly translates the problem statement into a mathematical equation.\n- **Potential Issue:** I hope this doesn\u2019t lead to a complicated quadratic equation. But if it does, maybe I can simplify before expanding.\n\n**Check Before Proceeding:**\n\nDoes adding the same number to both parts maintain the ratio? Yes, because \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) needs to become \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\), and adding the same \\(x\\) should preserve that relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis approach makes sense, so let's move forward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Cross-Multiplication**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, I'll cross-multiply:\n\n\\[\n(3 + x) \\times 6 = (5 + x) \\times 5\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n6(3 + x) = 5(5 + x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\n18 + 6x = 25 + 5x\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting on This Step:**\n\n- **Does This Help?** Yes, it simplifies the equation by removing the fractions.\n- **Check:** I just need to ensure the expansion is correct.\n\n**Wait, Let's Verify:**\n\n6 times 3 is 18, and 6 times \\(x\\) is \\(6x\\). On the right, 5 times 5 is 25, and 5 times \\(x\\) is \\(5x\\). Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplify the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, let's get all the \\(x\\) terms on one side and constant terms on the other:\n\n\\[\n6x - 5x = 25 - 18\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nx = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting on This Result:**\n\n- **Is \\(x = 7\\) Reasonable?** Adding 7 to both the numerator and denominator seems large, but let's check if it works.\n- **Check:** Quickly, \\(\\frac{3 + 7}{5 + 7} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}\\), which matches the target.\n\n**Mistake Check:**\n\nWait, let me think. An initial reaction might be that 7 is too big, but the check confirms it works. Sometimes, gut feelings can be misleading if the math checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify that adding 7 indeed transforms \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) into \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3 + 7}{5 + 7} = \\frac{10}{12}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying \\(\\frac{10}{12}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 \\div 2}{12 \\div 2} = \\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Match?** Yes, \\(\\frac{10}{12}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\), which is our goal.\n- **Final Check:** The steps led logically to the solution, and the verification confirms its correctness.\n\n**Wait, Is There Another Way?**\n\nI'm thinking about whether there\u2019s a quicker method, like simplifying ratios directly, but setting up the equation worked well here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, I decided to set up an equation based on the problem's requirements. Cross-multiplying simplified the equation, leading to \\(x = 7\\). Verifying the solution confirmed that adding 7 to both the numerator and denominator of \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) indeed makes it equivalent to \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\n**Recalling the Process:**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started with setting up an equation, considered cross-multiplication as an alternative.\n- **Execution:** Applied cross-multiplication, simplified the equation, and solved for \\(x\\).\n- **Reflection:** Regularly checked each step for correctness, ensuring the approach was valid.\n- **Verification:** Confirmed the solution by plugging \\(x\\) back into the original fraction transformation.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Methodical Approach:** Following a step-by-step process helped identify and correct any potential errors.\n- **Importance of Verification:** Checking each step ensured the final answer was accurate.\n- **Flexibility in Strategies:** Being open to changing methods when one approach seems unclear or complicated is crucial.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe number that can be added to both the numerator and denominator of \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) to make it equivalent to \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) is **7**.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough demonstrates the thought process involved in solving the problem, including brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting and checking work, and verifying the final solution.
