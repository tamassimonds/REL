    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, and checking my work along the way. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, I see that there are three guests and each is supposed to receive a breakfast with one nut roll, one cheese roll, and one fruit roll. So each guest gets a total of three rolls, one of each type.\n\nThe tricky part is that after wrapping, the rolls become indistinguishable. Then, three rolls are randomly placed in a bag for each guest. The goal is to find the probability that each guest ends up with one roll of each type.\n\nInitially, I\u2019m thinking this might involve **combinatorics**\u2014maybe something about selecting rolls out of a total. But then, I wonder if there's a **probability** aspect here too because we're dealing with chances of specific distributions.\n\nAnother thought is to use the concept of **arrangements** or **permutations**, since the order in which the rolls are packed might matter at first glance. But wait, since the rolls are indistinguishable after being wrapped, that might simplify things.\n\nI'm feeling a bit stuck because I'm not sure if I should approach it by calculating the total number of favorable outcomes versus the total possible outcomes or if there's a different way. Maybe both approaches will help clarify.\n\nLet me brainstorm some strategies:\n\n1. **Combinatorial Approach:** Calculate the total number of ways to distribute the rolls and the number of favorable ways where each guest gets one of each type.\n   \n2. **Probability Tree:** Visualize the selection process step by step to see how probabilities unfold.\n\n3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Since we're dealing with probabilities involving multiple groups, this could account for overlapping cases.\n\nHmm, the combinatorial approach seems straightforward, but I\u2019m also tempted to sketch a probability tree to get a visual sense. Let's start with the combinatorial method and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Total Number of Rolls and Distribution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFirst, let's determine the total number of rolls and how they can be distributed among the guests.\n\n- There are **3 types of rolls**: nut, cheese, and fruit.\n- **Each type has 3 rolls**, making a total of **9 rolls**.\n\nSo, we have:\n- 3 nut rolls\n- 3 cheese rolls\n- 3 fruit rolls\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so the total number of rolls is 9. Each guest is supposed to get 3 rolls. I need to figure out how many ways these rolls can be distributed while ensuring each guest gets one of each type.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nLet\u2019s calculate the total number of ways to distribute these 9 rolls into 3 bags (one for each guest), each containing 3 rolls.\n\nThis is a **multinomial coefficient problem** because we\u2019re distributing multiple indistinguishable items into distinct groups.\n\nThe formula for multinomial distribution is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times n_3!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of rolls\n- \\( n_1, n_2, n_3 \\) are the number of rolls of each type allocated to the guests\n\nBut since each guest gets exactly one of each type, \\( n_1 = n_2 = n_3 = 3 \\).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to distribute the rolls is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\frac{9!}{3! \\times 3! \\times 3!}\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s compute that.\n\n\\[\n9! = 362,880\n\\]\n\\[\n3! = 6\n\\]\n\\[\n3! \\times 3! \\times 3! = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{362,880}{216} = 1,680\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes 1,680 seem reasonable? Let's think about it: We're distributing 9 distinct positions (rolls) into 3 bags, each needing 3 positions, considering rolls of the same type are indistinguishable. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so there are **1,680** total ways to distribute the rolls.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Favorable Outcomes Where Each Guest Gets One of Each Type**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where each guest receives one nut roll, one cheese roll, and one fruit roll.\n\nThis feels like a **restricted combination** problem\u2014ensuring each guest has exactly one of each type.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nWait, how can I ensure that? Maybe by first selecting one roll of each type for each guest and then distributing the remaining rolls.\n\nBut since each guest needs one of each type, maybe I can directly calculate it by considering how to allocate one roll of each type to each guest without overlaps.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nPerhaps another way is to calculate the probability step by step, ensuring the constraints are met at each stage.\n\nLet me think this through.\n\n- **Select Nut Rolls:** There are 3 nut rolls, and each guest needs one. So, we need to assign these to the 3 guests.\n- **Select Cheese Rolls:** Same as nut rolls.\n- **Select Fruit Rolls:** Same again.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIt seems like each type can be independently assigned to the guests, ensuring each gets one of each.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nFor each type of roll, the number of ways to assign one roll to each guest is the number of **permutations** of the rolls.\n\nBut since the rolls are indistinguishable within their type, it's simply the number of ways to assign distinct positions to each guest.\n\nSo, for each type:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ways} = 3!\n\\]\n\nSince there are 3 types, the total number of favorable ways is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable ways} = (3!)^3 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Each type's rolls are being assigned uniquely to each guest, ensuring the condition is met. Therefore, 216 seems correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, there are **216** favorable outcomes where each guest receives one roll of each type.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to find the probability that each guest gets one roll of each type. Probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Favorable ways}}{\\text{Total ways}} = \\frac{216}{1,680}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \nLet's simplify this fraction.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{216}{1,680} = \\frac{216 \\div 24}{1,680 \\div 24} = \\frac{9}{70}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this simplification make sense? Let\u2019s see:\n\n\\[\n216 \\div 24 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n1,680 \\div 24 = 70\n\\]\n\nYes, both divisions are correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the probability is \\(\\frac{9}{70}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding \\( m + n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe probability is given as \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime integers. Here, \\(m = 9\\) and \\(n = 70\\).\n\n253)** Check Again:**  \nLet\u2019s double-check everything to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Total Ways:** 1,680\u2014seems reasonable for distributing indistinguishable rolls among guests.\n- **Favorable Ways:** 216\u2014assigning one of each type to each guest makes sense.\n- **Probability Simplification:** \\(\\frac{9}{70}\\)\u2014correct simplification.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The approach is consistent, and the numbers align logically.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nm = 9,\\ n = 70 \\implies m + n = 9 + 70 = 79\n\\]\n\nAlright, so after brainstorming different strategies, checking each step, and reflecting on the calculations, the final answer is **79**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nBy starting with a combinatorial approach, I was able to methodically determine both the total number of roll distributions and the favorable distributions where each guest received one of each type. Along the way, checking and reflecting ensured accuracy, leading to a clear and correct solution.\n\nHope this detailed walkthrough helps!
