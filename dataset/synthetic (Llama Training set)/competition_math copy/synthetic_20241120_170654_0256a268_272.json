    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it by brainstorming various strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I think:\n\n- **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the least positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - n \\) is divisible by some but not all integers \\( k \\) within the range \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq n \\).\n  \n- **Initial Brainstorming**: \n  - This reminds me of divisibility problems involving squares and products. \n  - Maybe factoring could help because the expression \\( n^2 - n \\) can be factored into \\( n(n - 1) \\).\n  - I wonder if analyzing the divisors of \\( n(n - 1) \\) might reveal patterns.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies**: \n  - **Strategy 1**: Factor the expression and analyze its divisors.\n  - **Strategy 2**: Check small values of \\( n \\) to see if a pattern emerges.\n  - **Strategy 3**: Consider the properties of composite vs. prime numbers since \\( n(n - 1) \\) involves multiplying two consecutive integers.\n\nLet me start with **Strategy 1**, factoring the expression, and see where it leads.\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring the Expression**\n\n**Thought Process**: \n- \\( n^2 - n \\) can be factored as \\( n(n - 1) \\).\n- This means the expression is the product of two consecutive integers: \\( n \\) and \\( n - 1 \\).\n\n**Calculations**: \n- So, \\( n(n - 1) \\) is always even because one of \\( n \\) or \\( n - 1 \\) is always divisible by 2.\n\n**Reflection**: \n- Okay, being even is a start, but I need more than just divisibility by 2. I need \\( n(n - 1) \\) to be divisible by some \\( k \\) but not all \\( k \\) in the range \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq n \\).\n\n**Realization**: \n- Being even doesn't differentiate between all or some divisors. I need to look deeper into the divisors of \\( n(n - 1) \\).\n\n**Next Step**: \n- Perhaps examining the divisors of \\( n(n - 1) \\) for small \\( n \\) can help identify a pattern.\n\n### **Step 2: Testing Small Values of \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process**: \n- Let\u2019s start with \\( n = 2 \\) and go up to see which integers \\( k \\) divide \\( n(n - 1) \\) and whether it's divisible by some but not all.\n\n**Calculations**:\n\n1. **For \\( n = 2 \\)**:\n   - \\( n(n - 1) = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\).\n   - Divisors: 1, 2.\n   - From \\( k = 1 \\) to 2, \\( 2 \\) is divisible by both \\( k = 1 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\).\n   - **Conclusion**: Divisible by all \\( k \\). Not what we want.\n\n2. **For \\( n = 3 \\)**:\n   - \\( n(n - 1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\).\n   - Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6.\n   - From \\( k = 1 \\) to 3:\n     - \\( k = 1 \\): 6 is divisible.\n     - \\( k = 2 \\): 6 is divisible.\n     - \\( k = 3 \\): 6 is divisible.\n   - **Conclusion**: Again, divisible by all \\( k \\).\n\n3. **For \\( n = 4 \\)**:\n   - \\( n(n - 1) = 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\).\n   - Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n   - From \\( k = 1 \\) to 4:\n     - \\( k = 1 \\): 12 is divisible.\n     - \\( k = 2 \\): 12 is divisible.\n     - \\( k = 3 \\): 12 is divisible.\n     - \\( k = 4 \\): 12 is divisible.\n   - **Conclusion**: Still divisible by all.\n\n**Reflection**:\n- So far, \\( n = 2, 3, \\) and \\( 4 \\) are divisible by all \\( k \\). This isn't helping narrow down the solution. I need to consider larger \\( n \\) or perhaps look for another pattern.\n\n**Realization**:\n- Perhaps smaller \\( n \\) don't work because \\( n(n - 1) \\) is too small to have a proper subset of divisors. Maybe starting from \\( n = 5 \\) could be more insightful.\n\n**Next Step**:\n- Continue testing with \\( n = 5 \\) and beyond.\n\n### **Step 3: Continuing with \\( n = 5 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- Let's see if \\( n = 5 \\) breaks the pattern.\n\n**Calculations**:\n\n1. **For \\( n = 5 \\)**:\n   - \\( n(n - 1) = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\).\n   - Divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.\n   - From \\( k = 1 \\) to 5:\n     - \\( k = 1 \\): 20 is divisible.\n     - \\( k = 2 \\): 20 is divisible.\n     - \\( k = 3 \\): 20 is **not** divisible.\n     - \\( k = 4 \\): 20 is divisible.\n     - \\( k = 5 \\): 20 is divisible.\n   - **Conclusion**: Divisible by all \\( k \\) except \\( k = 3 \\).\n\n**Reflection**:\n- Wait, this seems promising. \\( n = 5 \\) is divisible by all \\( k \\) except \\( k = 3 \\). That fits the criteria of being divisible by some but not all.\n\n**Realization**:\n- This could be the solution, but I should verify with higher \\( n \\) to ensure the pattern holds.\n\n**Next Step**:\n- Test \\( n = 6 \\) to see if the pattern continues.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with \\( n = 6 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- Before finalizing \\( n = 5 \\) as the least integer, let\u2019s confirm with \\( n = 6 \\).\n\n**Calculations**:\n\n1. **For \\( n = 6 \\)**:\n   - \\( n(n - 1) = 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\).\n   - Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.\n   - From \\( k = 1 \\) to 6:\n     - \\( k = 1 \\): 30 is divisible.\n     - \\( k = 2 \\): 30 is divisible.\n     - \\( k = 3 \\): 30 is divisible.\n     - \\( k = 4 \\): 30 is **not** divisible.\n     - \\( k = 5 \\): 30 is divisible.\n     - \\( k = 6 \\): 30 is divisible.\n   - **Conclusion**: Divisible by all \\( k \\) except \\( k = 4 \\).\n\n**Reflection**:\n- This confirms that \\( n = 6 \\) also fits the criteria. However, since \\( n = 5 \\) is smaller and already meets the conditions, it makes sense that \\( n = 5 \\) is the least positive integer that satisfies the problem.\n\n**Realization**:\n- **Ah, I see that \\( n = 6 \\)** also works, but since we're looking for the least \\( n \\), and \\( n = 5 \\) was the first instance where \\( n(n - 1) \\) was divisible by some but not all \\( k \\), \\( n = 5 \\) is the correct answer.\n\n**Next Step**:\n- Finalize the answer, ensuring all steps align with the problem's requirements.\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Reflection**:\n- Throughout the process, starting from \\( n = 2 \\) and testing up to \\( n = 6 \\), it became clear that \\( n = 5 \\) is the smallest integer where \\( n(n - 1) \\) is divisible by some but not all \\( k \\) within the given range. Testing beyond \\( n = 6 \\) isn't necessary since we've already identified the least \\( n \\) satisfying the condition.\n\n**Mistake Check**:\n- Initially, I considered factoring \\( n(n - 1) \\) and looking for patterns in its divisors. This led me to test small values of \\( n \\), which eventually revealed that \\( n = 5 \\) is the least integer meeting the criteria. If I hadn't continued testing beyond \\( n = 4 \\), I might have prematurely concluded that a larger \\( n \\) was needed, but the pattern emerged clearly by checking \\( n = 5 \\) and \\( n = 6 \\).\n\n**Final Conclusion**:\n- The least positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - n \\) is divisible by some but not all integer values of \\( k \\) where \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq n \\) is **5**.\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through each step, testing various strategies, and reflecting on the results, I ensured a thorough and accurate approach to solving the problem.",

  "ground_truth": "Note that $n^2-n=n(n-1)$ is divisible by $1$, $n-1$, and $n$. Since we want $n^2-n$ to be divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$, we must have $n-1>2$ so $n>3$. If $n=4$, $n$ is divisible by 2, so $n^2-n$ is divisible by all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$. Therefore, the least $n$ is $n=\\boxed{5}$."
