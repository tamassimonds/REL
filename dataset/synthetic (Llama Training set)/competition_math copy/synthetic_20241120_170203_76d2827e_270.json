    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll approach it as I would naturally think through it, making sure to brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem states:\n\n\"The number \\( n \\) is a prime number between 20 and 30. If you divide \\( n \\) by 8, the remainder is 5. What is the value of \\( n \\)?\"\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Prime Numbers Between 20 and 30:** Let me recall which prime numbers lie in that range. I know that prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves, so that narrows it down.\n  \n- **Remainder When Divided by 8:** This part reminds me of modular arithmetic. I need to find a number that gives a specific remainder when divided by 8.\n\n- **Combining Both Conditions:** I have to find a prime number that fits both criteria. This feels like a problem where I might need to list possible candidates and check them one by one.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **List All Prime Numbers Between 20 and 30:** This seems straightforward. I can then check which of these primes leave a remainder of 5 when divided by 8.\n\n2. **Use Modular Arithmetic from the Start:** Maybe I can set up an equation using modular arithmetic to find \\( n \\) directly.\n\n3. **Elimination Approach:** Start with all numbers between 20 and 30, eliminate non-primes, and then see which of the remaining primes fit the remainder condition.\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\nBefore I proceed, I notice that the problem specifies only prime numbers between 20 and 30. That narrows down my list significantly. Let me jot down the prime numbers in that range to make sure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: List Prime Numbers Between 20 and 30**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me recall or quickly list the prime numbers between 20 and 30. This will give me the candidates to work with.\n\n**Listing Primes:**\n\n- 23\n- 29\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so there are only two prime numbers in that range: 23 and 29. This simplifies things. I only need to check these two against the remainder condition.\n\n**Check:**\n\nHmm, just two numbers to test. That should make my job easier. Let's see if either of them satisfies the remainder condition when divided by 8.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Check Which Prime Number Leaves a Remainder of 5 When Divided by 8**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to see which of the listed prime numbers (23 and 29) gives a remainder of 5 when divided by 8. This is where I apply the modular arithmetic concept.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **For \\( n = 23 \\):**\n  \\[\n  23 \\div 8 = 2 \\quad \\text{(since 8 goes into 23 two times, 16)} \\\\\n  23 - 16 = 7 \\quad \\text{(remainder)}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Wait, that can't be right because...** The remainder is 7, not 5. So, 23 doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\n- **For \\( n = 29 \\):**\n  \\[\n  29 \\div 8 = 3 \\quad \\text{(since 8 goes into 29 three times, 24)} \\\\\n  29 - 24 = 5 \\quad \\text{(remainder)}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Aha!** The remainder is 5. So, 29 satisfies both conditions: it's prime and gives a remainder of 5 when divided by 8.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me double-check the calculation for \\( n = 29 \\):\n\n- \\( 29 - 24 = 5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- Prime number between 20 and 30? \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, 29 meets both criteria.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Confirm the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI\u2019ve identified that 29 is the only prime number between 20 and 30 that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8. To be sure, let's quickly recap the steps and ensure everything aligns.\n\n**Recap:**\n\n1. **Listed Primes Between 20 and 30:** Found 23 and 29.\n2. **Checked Remainder When Divided by 8:**\n   - 23 leaves a remainder of 7.\n   - 29 leaves a remainder of 5.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The only prime number that fits both the given range and the remainder condition is 29.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{29}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nWhile initially, I considered listing all primes and verifying them one by one, which worked well given the small range, I also reflected on using modular arithmetic more directly. In this case, given only two candidates, the list-and-check method was efficient.\n\nThroughout, I made sure to check each step, ensuring the calculations were correct. When 23 didn't satisfy the remainder condition, it narrowed down the solution to 29 without ambiguity.\n\nThis problem was straightforward once the prime candidates were identified, but it's essential to verify each step to confirm that all conditions are met.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step walkthrough captures the thought process naturally, including brainstorming, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.

  "ground_truth": "We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30). So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24. Adding 5, we get 21 and 29. Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\\boxed{29}$.\n\nOR\n\nWhen we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. That means 21 will have a remainder of 5. The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$. When we consider 21 and 29, $\\boxed{29}$ is the prime number."
