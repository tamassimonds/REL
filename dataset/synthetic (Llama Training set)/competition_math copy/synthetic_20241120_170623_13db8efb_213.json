    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step-by-step, just like how I would naturally approach it if I were solving it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem says that two standard 6-sided dice are rolled, and I need to find the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled is a perfect square.\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** \n  - I've dealt with dice probability before, so this feels somewhat familiar.\n  - Perfect squares within the range of dice sums are 1, 4, 9, and possibly 16.\n  - But wait, the maximum sum with two dice is 12 (6 + 6), so 16 is out.\n  \n- **Reflection:** \n  - I need to focus on perfect squares between 1 and 12.\n  - Perfect squares in this range are 1 (but impossible with two dice), 4, and 9.\n\n**Conclusion:** \n- The possible perfect square sums are 4 and 9.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **List All Possible Outcomes:**\n   - Create a list or a table showing all possible sums and identify which are perfect squares.\n\n2. **Use Probability Formula:**\n   - Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total possible outcomes.\n\n3. **Simulate Rolling Dice:**\n   - Although not practical here, simulating multiple rolls could give an empirical probability.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Listing All Possible Outcomes** seems straightforward and systematic.\n- **Probability Formula** will be part of this once I know the favorable outcomes.\n- **Simulating Rolls** would be more time-consuming and less precise for a small sample like this.\n\n**Decision:** \n- I'll start with **Listing All Possible Outcomes** to identify the perfect square sums, then proceed with the probability calculation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Listing All Possible Outcomes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- When rolling two dice, each die has 6 faces, so there are a total of \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\) possible outcomes.\n- I'll list all possible sums and mark which ones are perfect squares.\n\n**Step-by-Step Listing:**\n\n| Die 1 | Die 2 | Sum  |\n|-------|-------|------|\n|   1   |   1   |  2   |\n|   1   |   2   |  3   |\n|   1   |   3   |  4   |\n|   1   |   4   |  5   |\n|   1   |   5   |  6   |\n|   1   |   6   |  7   |\n|   2   |   1   |  3   |\n|   2   |   2   |  4   |\n|   2   |   3   |  5   |\n|   2   |   4   |  6   |\n|   2   |   5   |  7   |\n|   2   |   6   |  8   |\n|   3   |   1   |  4   |\n|   3   |   2   |  5   |\n|   3   |   3   |  6   |\n|   3   |   4   |  7   |\n|   3   |   5   |  8   |\n|   3   |   6   |  9   |\n|   4   |   1   |  5   |\n|   4   |   2   |  6   |\n|   4   |   3   |  7   |\n|   4   |   4   |  8   |\n|   4   |   5   |  9   |\n|   4   |   6   | 10   |\n|   5   |   1   |  6   |\n|   5   |   2   |  7   |\n|   5   |   3   |  8   |\n|   5   |   4   |  9   |\n|   5   |   5   | 10   |\n|   5   |   6   | 11   |\n|   6   |   1   |  7   |\n|   6   |   2   |  8   |\n|   6   |   3   |  9   |\n|   6   |   4   | 10   |\n|   6   |   5   | 11   |\n|   6   |   6   | 12   |\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Identifying Perfect Squares:**\n  - From the table, the sums that are perfect squares are 4 and 9.\n  - Sum of 4 occurs in: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) \u2014 **3 outcomes**\n  - Sum of 9 occurs in: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3) \u2014 **4 outcomes**\n  \n- **Total Favorable Outcomes:** \n  - \\(3 + 4 = 7\\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Favorable Outcomes:** 7\n- **Total Possible Outcomes:** 36\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n- So, \\( P(\\text{sum is a perfect square}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total possible outcomes}} \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{7}{36}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** \n  - Wait, there are 36 possible outcomes, and we identified 7 favorable ones. \n  - That seems reasonable since not all sums are perfect squares.\n  - Also, perfect squares (4 and 9) are less common than non-perfect squares in the range of 2 to 12.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The probability that the sum rolled is a perfect square is \\( \\frac{7}{36} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Verification:** \n  - Let me double-check if I've correctly identified all the perfect square sums and their corresponding outcomes.\n  - It's important to ensure that no possible outcome is missed and that the counts are accurate.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Re-examine Perfect Squares:**\n   - Only 4 and 9 are perfect squares between the possible sums (2 to 12).\n\n2. **Re-check Favorable Outcomes:**\n   - For sum 4: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) \u2192 3 outcomes\n   - For sum 9: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3) \u2192 4 outcomes\n   - Total: 7 outcomes\n\n3. **Confirm Total Outcomes:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Everything checks out. The number of favorable outcomes and the total possible outcomes align correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n  - A probability of \\( \\frac{7}{36} \\) is approximately 0.1944 or 19.44%.\n  - Given that only a few sums are perfect squares compared to the total possible sums, this probability seems reasonable.\n\n- **Was the Approach Correct?**\n  - Yes, by listing all possible outcomes and identifying the perfect square sums, I accurately calculated the probability.\n\n- **Would Another Strategy Have Been More Efficient?**\n  - Listing outcomes was straightforward for this problem due to the small sample size.\n  - For larger or more complex problems, other strategies like combinatorial methods might be more efficient.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n- The probability that the sum rolled is a perfect square is **\\( \\frac{7}{36} \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap of the Process:**\n\n1. **Brainstormed and Identified Perfect Squares:** Recognized that only sums 4 and 9 are perfect squares within the possible range.\n   \n2. **Listed All Possible Outcomes:** Created a comprehensive table of all possible sums from rolling two dice.\n   \n3. **Counted Favorable Outcomes:** Counted the number of outcomes where the sum is a perfect square.\n   \n4. **Calculated Probability:** Used the probability formula to find \\( \\frac{7}{36} \\).\n   \n5. **Verified and Reflected:** Double-checked the counts and ensured the approach was correct. Confirmed that the probability makes sense.\n\nThroughout the process, I remained open to adjusting my strategy, reflecting on each step, and verifying the correctness of my approach, ensuring a thorough and accurate solution.",
