    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming various strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. It\u2019s important to mimic natural human thought processes\u2014sometimes I\u2019ll get an idea, realize it\u2019s not right, and then try something else.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n- **Expression Structure:** It looks like a polynomial expression with multiple terms, and I need to find the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) after simplification.\n- **Initial Approach:** Perhaps I should expand the expression and then collect like terms, focusing specifically on the \\(x^3\\) terms.\n- **Alternative Consideration:** Maybe factoring could help, but with multiple distributions, expansion seems straightforward.\n\nBut then I think, **Wait**, expanding might get messy with so many terms. Is there a quicker way? Maybe I can handle one part at a time and only extract the \\(x^3\\) terms as I go along.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Expand Fully:** Distribute each term as usual and then combine like terms.\n2. **Selective Expansion:** Only expand terms that contribute to \\(x^3\\).\n3. **Factorization:** Factor out common terms first, if possible, to simplify before expanding.\n4. **Use of Binomial Theorem or Patterns:** But that seems unnecessary here since there are no obvious patterns.\n\n**Reflection:** Expansion seems the most direct, but to avoid getting overwhelmed, I\u2019ll start by handling each grouped term separately.\n\n### **Step 1: Handle the First Group**\n\nLet's look at the first part:  \n\\[ 3(x^2 - x^3 + x) \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Distribute 3:** I should distribute 3 to each term inside the parentheses.\n- **Terms After Distribution:**  \n  \\[ 3x^2 - 3x^3 + 3x \\]\n\n**Check:** This seems straightforward. Multiplying each term by 3 should be correct.  \n**Wait**, am I missing anything? I just need to ensure all terms are correctly expanded.\n\n### **Step 2: Handle the Second Group**\n\nNow, the second part:  \n\\[ 3(x + 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x^5 + x^3) \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Distribute 3:** Multiply each term inside by 3.\n- **Terms After Distribution:**  \n  \\[ 3x + 6x^3 - 9x^2 + 9x^5 + 3x^3 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Combining Like Terms:** Notice that \\(6x^3 + 3x^3 = 9x^3\\).  \n- **Final Simplified Form:**  \n  \\[ 3x + 9x^3 - 9x^2 + 9x^5 \\]\n\n**Check:** This looks right. I added the \\(x^3\\) terms correctly. But wait, did I distribute 3 to all terms? Let me double-check. Yes, every term is multiplied by 3.\n\n### **Step 3: Handle the Third Group**\n\nFinally, the last part:  \n\\[ -5(1 + x - 4x^3 - x^2) \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Distribute -5:** Multiply each term inside by -5.\n- **Terms After Distribution:**  \n  \\[ -5 - 5x + 20x^3 + 5x^2 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Combining Like Terms:** None here since this is a standalone group.\n- **Check Distribution:** Every term is multiplied by -5. This seems correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine All Simplified Parts**\n\nNow, let\u2019s put everything together:  \n\\[ (3x^2 - 3x^3 + 3x) + (3x + 9x^3 - 9x^2 + 9x^5) + (-5 - 5x + 20x^3 + 5x^2) \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Organize by Power of x:** It might help to write terms grouped by their degree to easily identify like terms.\n\n**Before Combining:**  \n- **x^5 Terms:** \\(9x^5\\)  \n- **x^3 Terms:** \\(-3x^3 + 9x^3 + 20x^3 = 26x^3\\)  \n- **x^2 Terms:** \\(3x^2 - 9x^2 + 5x^2 = -1x^2\\)  \n- **x Terms:** \\(3x + 3x - 5x = 1x\\)  \n- **Constant Term:** \\(-5\\)\n\n**Combined Simplified Expression:**  \n\\[ 9x^5 + 26x^3 - x^2 + x - 5 \\]\n\n### **Step 5: Extract the Coefficient of \\(x^3\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Looking at the Combined Expression:** The coefficient of \\(x^3\\) is clearly **26**.\n- **Double-Check:** Is there any mistake in combining the \\(x^3\\) terms? Let\u2019s revisit those calculations.\n\n**Revisiting \\(x^3\\) Terms:**  \n- **From First Group:** \\(-3x^3\\)  \n- **From Second Group:** \\(9x^3\\)  \n- **From Third Group:** \\(20x^3\\)\n\n**Total \\(x^3\\) Coefficient:**  \n\\[ -3 + 9 + 20 = 26 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis addition checks out. **Wait**, should I have caught any signs changing here? No, each distribution was correctly applied.\n\n**Check:** No mistakes in adding \\(x^3\\) terms. The coefficient is indeed **26**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^3\\) after simplifying the given expression is **26**.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Expanding each group separately and then combining like terms was effective. \n- **Did the Strategy Work?** Yes, focusing on one part at a time prevented errors and made it easier to handle.\n- **Mistakes Noired:** Initially thought about expanding everything at once, but realizing that handling each part separately was more manageable helped streamline the process.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** Always check each step, especially when dealing with multiple terms. Breaking down the problem into smaller parts can prevent mistakes and make the solution clearer.",
