Here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, I see the problem: **There are 6 married couples at a party. At the start of the party, everyone shakes hands once with every other person except their spouse. How many handshakes occur?**\n\nWhen I first read this, my initial reaction is that it involves counting handshakes among a group of people with some restrictions. It reminds me of the classic \"handshake problem\" but with the added complexity of not shaking hands with one's spouse.\n\nThis makes me think about using combinatorics or perhaps a more straightforward counting strategy. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. So, let's brainstorm a bit.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Total Possible Handshakes Without Restrictions:**\n   - **Thought:** Maybe I can calculate the total number of handshakes if there were no restrictions and then subtract those that don't occur because spouses don't shake hands.\n   - **Check:** This seems like a logical approach. First, calculate the total handshakes and then adjust for the spouses not shaking hands.\n\n2. **Consider Each Person Individually:**\n   - **Thought:** Another way could be to consider how many handshakes each person makes individually, excluding their spouse, and then sum these up.\n   - **Check:** This might be more tedious but could work. However, I remember that handshakes are mutual, so counting each person's handshakes individually might double-count the total.\n\n3. **Graph Theory Approach:**\n   - **Thought:** Use a graph where each person is a node, and handshakes are edges, excluding edges between spouses.\n   - **Check:** This feels a bit advanced for a simple counting problem, but maybe visualizing it this way could help.\n\n4. **Alternating Approaches:**\n   - **Thought:** Perhaps alternating between calculating total handshakes and adjusting for spouse exclusions could provide clarity.\n   - **Check:** This might lead to overcomplicating things, but let's keep it in mind as a backup.\n\n---\n\n### **Starting with Strategy 1: Total Possible Handshakes Without Restrictions**\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with calculating the total handshakes if there were no restrictions and then subtract the handshakes that don\u2019t occur due to spouses not participating.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Handshakes Without Any Restrictions**\n\n- **Formula for Total Handshakes:** In a group of \\( n \\) people, the number of ways to choose 2 people to shake hands is given by the combination formula:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Handshakes} = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Application:** Here, \\( n = 12 \\) (since there are 6 couples, each with 2 people).\n\n  \\[\n  \\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** So, without any restrictions, there would be **66 handshakes**.\n\n- **Wait a minute...** That\u2019s the total if everyone shakes hands with everyone else, including their spouse. But we need to exclude the spouse handshakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exclude Spouse Handshakes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEach couple does not shake hands with each other, so we need to subtract those handshakes from the total.\n\n- **Number of Couples:** 6\n- **Handshakes Per Couple That Don\u2019t Occur:** 1 (each couple doesn\u2019t shake hands)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Handshakes to Exclude} = \\text{Number of Couples} \\times \\text{Handshakes Per Couple} = 6 \\times 1 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Adjusted Total Handshakes:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Adjusted Total Handshakes} = \\text{Total Handshakes} - \\text{Handshakes to Exclude} = 66 - 6 = 60\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, after excluding the handshakes that don\u2019t occur between spouses, the total number of handshakes is **60**.\n\n**Check:** This makes sense intuitively\u2014start with all possible handshakes and subtract the ones that don\u2019t happen due to the spouses.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does 60 seem reasonable?** Given that each person is shaking hands with 10 others (12 total minus themselves and their spouse), it seems plausible.\n- **Double-Counting Concern:** By subtracting 6 spouse handshakes from the total of 66, I\u2019m not double-counting because each spouse pair's handshake is only counted once in the total.\n\n**Conclusion:** The approach seems correct. Starting with the total possible handshakes and subtracting the spouse handshakes gives a logical and accurate result.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Considering Each Person Individually**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s see if calculating handshakes from each person\u2019s perspective yields the same result to verify the correctness.\n\n**Step 1: Handshakes Per Person**\n\n- **Total People:** 12\n- **Each Person Excludes Their Spouse:** So, each person shakes hands with \\( 12 - 1 - 1 = 10 \\) others.\n\n**Step 2: Total Handshakes Calculated This Way**\n\n- **Sum of All Individual Handshakes:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Handshakes} = \\frac{12 \\times 10}{2} = 60\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Dividing by 2 accounts for the fact that each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Comparison with Previous Result:** Both methods yield **60 handshakes**.\n- **Consistency:** This consistency between the two strategies confirms the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Does the total make sense?** Yes, excluding the spouse handshakes from the total possible handshakes aligns with intuitive and calculated approaches.\n- **Have all scenarios been considered?** Yes, both strategies account for all participants and exclude the necessary handshakes.\n- **Is there a simpler way?** While both methods work, starting with the total and subtracting the exclusions seems more straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer:** After exploring different strategies, verifying calculations, and ensuring consistency between methods, the total number of handshakes at the party is **60**.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Thoughts**\n\n- **Alternative Approaches:** I briefly considered using graph theory, but since the combinatorial approach worked well, I didn\u2019t pursue it further.\n- **Potential Mistakes:** Initially, I thought about simply subtracting spouse handshakes from the total, but double-checking ensured no double-counting occurred.\n- **Learning Point:** Verifying results through multiple strategies enhances confidence in the correctness of the answer.\n\n---\n\nBy reflecting throughout the process, checking each step, and being open to adjusting the approach, the solution is thorough and reliable. This methodical thinking ensures accuracy in tackling such combinatorial problems.",
