The question is **What is the unique three-digit positive integer \\( x \\) satisfying \\( 100x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{997} \\)?** \n\nInitially, I see a congruence equation involving modular arithmetic. This reminds me of problems where we need to find the multiplicative inverse of a number modulo another number. Specifically, finding \\( x \\) such that \\( 100x \\equiv 1 \\mod{997} \\) is about finding the multiplicative inverse of \\( 100 \\) modulo \\( 997 \\).\n\nA few strategies come to mind:\n\n1. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm:** This is a standard method to find the inverse in modular arithmetic. It should work since \\( 997 \\) is prime and \\( 100 \\) is less than \\( 997 \\), meaning \\( 100 \\) and \\( 997 \\) are coprime.\n\n2. **Trial and Error with Multiplication:** Multiplying \\( 100 \\) by various integers until the product modulo \\( 997 \\) equals \\( 1 \\). This could be time-consuming but might be insightful.\n\n3. **Using Fermat's Little Theorem:** Since \\( 997 \\) is prime, this theorem can help find the inverse by raising \\( 100 \\) to the power of \\( 997-2 = 995 \\).\n\n4. **Brute Force Calculation:** Simply calculate \\( 100 \\times x \\mod{997} \\) for \\( x \\) values until we find the one that gives \\( 1 \\).\n\nLet me explore these strategies, starting with the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**, as it's the most direct and systematic approach for finding modular inverses.\n\n### Step 1: Applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe Extended Euclidean Algorithm helps find integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nax + by = \\gcd(a, b)\n\\]\n\nIn our case:\n\n\\[\n100x + 997y = \\gcd(100, 997)\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 997 \\) is prime and \\( 100 \\) is less than \\( 997 \\), \\( \\gcd(100, 997) = 1 \\). This means that the equation will have integer solutions, and \\( x \\) will be the multiplicative inverse of \\( 100 \\) modulo \\( 997 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's set up the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n1. **Euclidean Algorithm:** Find the gcd by performing division steps.\n\n   \\[\n   997 = 9 \\times 100 + 97\n   \\]\n\n   (Here, \\( 9 \\times 100 = 900 \\), and \\( 997 - 900 = 97 \\))\n\n   \\[\n   100 = 1 \\times 97 + 3\n   \\]\n\n   (Here, \\( 1 \\times 97 = 97 \\), and \\( 100 - 97 = 3 \\))\n\n   \\[\n   97 = 32 \\times 3 + 1\n   \\]\n\n   (Here, \\( 32 \\times 3 = 96 \\), and \\( 97 - 96 = 1 \\))\n\n   \\[\n   3 = 3 \\times 1 + 0\n   \\]\n\n   (Remainder is \\( 0 \\), so we stop here)\n\n   The gcd is \\( 1 \\), confirming that \\( 100 \\) and \\( 997 \\) are coprime.\n\n2. **Back Substitution:** Now, we express \\( 1 \\) as a linear combination of \\( 100 \\) and \\( 997 \\).\n\n   From the previous step:\n\n   \\[\n   1 = 97 - 32 \\times 3\n   \\]\n\n   Substitute \\( 3 \\) from the second step:\n\n   \\[\n   1 = 97 - 32 \\times (100 - 1 \\times 97)\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplify:\n\n   \\[\n   1 = 97 - 32 \\times 100 + 32 \\times 97\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   1 = 33 \\times 97 - 32 \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \n   Substitute \\( 97 \\) from the first step:\n\n   \\[\n   1 = 33 \\times (997 - 9 \\times 100) - 32 \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplify:\n\n   \\[\n   1 = 33 \\times 997 - 297 \\times 100 - 32 \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   1 = 33 \\times 997 - 329 \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n   So,\n\n   \\[\n   100 \\times (-329) + 997 \\times 33 = 1\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, \\( x = -329 \\) and \\( y = 33 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, \\( x = -329 \\) isn't a three-digit positive integer. I need to convert \\( -329 \\) into a positive equivalent within the range of three-digit numbers modulo \\( 997 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, negative numbers can be adjusted by adding the modulus. Let's bring \\( -329 \\) into the positive range by adding \\( 997 \\):\n\n\\[\nx = -329 + 997 = 668\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( x = 668 \\), which is a three-digit positive integer.\n\n### Step 2: Verifying the Solution\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore moving on, it's crucial to verify that \\( 100 \\times 668 \\equiv 1 \\mod{997} \\). This ensures that the solution is correct.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's compute \\( 100 \\times 668 \\mod{997} \\):\n\n\\[\n100 \\times 668 = 66800\n\\]\n\nNow, divide \\( 66800 \\) by \\( 997 \\) to find the remainder:\n\n\\[\n66800 \\div 997 \\approx 67.006\n\\]\n\nTaking the integer part:\n\n\\[\n67 \\times 997 = 66799\n\\]\n\nSubtract from \\( 66800 \\):\n\n\\[\n66800 - 66799 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n66800 \\equiv 1 \\mod{997}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nYes, \\( 100 \\times 668 \\equiv 1 \\mod{997} \\), confirming that \\( x = 668 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n### Step 3: Exploring Alternative Strategies\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWhile the Extended Euclidean Algorithm worked well, it's always good to explore other methods to ensure the robustness of the solution. Let's try **Fermat's Little Theorem** and the **Trial and Error with Multiplication** methods.\n\n**Method 1: Fermat's Little Theorem**\n\nFermat's Little Theorem states that if \\( p \\) is a prime and \\( a \\) is not divisible by \\( p \\), then:\n\n\\[\na^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod{p}\n\\]\n\nIn this case:\n\n\\[\n100^{997-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod{997}\n\\]\n\nWhich implies that:\n\n\\[\n100^{996} \\equiv 1 \\mod{997}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the inverse of \\( 100 \\) modulo \\( 997 \\) is \\( 100^{996} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, calculating \\( 100^{996} \\mod{997} \\) directly would be cumbersome without a calculator. However, since we've already found the inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, and the verification step confirmed it, Fermat's Little Theorem serves as a theoretical backup but isn't necessary here for practical calculation.\n\n**Method 2: Trial and Error with Multiplication**\n\nLet's see if multiplying \\( 100 \\) by various integers around \\( 668 \\) gives us \\( 1 \\mod{997} \\).\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n100 \\times 667 = 66700\n\\]\n\n\\[\n66700 \\div 997 \\approx 66.999\n\\]\n\n\\[\n66 \\times 997 = 65862\n\\]\n\n\\[\n66700 - 65862 = 838\n\\]\n\n\\[\n838 \\neq 1\n\\]\n\nNext:\n\n\\[\n100 \\times 668 = 66800 \\div 997 = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n100 \\times 669\n\\]\n\n\\[\n66900 \\div 997 \\approx 67.084\n\\]\n\n\\[\n67 \\times 997 = 66799\n\\]\n\n\\[\n66900 - 66799 = 101\n\\]\n\n\\[\n101 \\neq 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis method confirms our earlier solution since \\( 100 \\times 668 \\equiv 1 \\mod{997} \\). However, it's less efficient than the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\n### Final Check\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that all strategies align and that no steps were missed or incorrectly computed.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Extended Euclidean Algorithm:** Provided \\( x = 668 \\), verified.\n- **Fermat's Little Theorem:** Theoretically supports the solution but wasn't needed for calculation.\n- **Trial and Error:** Confirms \\( 100 \\times 668 \\equiv 1 \\mod{997} \\).\n\nEverything is consistent, and the solution is validated.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the solution, the unique three-digit positive integer \\( x \\) satisfying \\( 100x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{997} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{668}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nStarting with brainstorming helped identify that the Extended Euclidean Algorithm was the most straightforward approach. Reflecting on each step ensured that the solution was correct, and checking various methods confirmed the validity. This step-by-step process, including exploring alternatives and verifying, led to a confident and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We can start by multiplying both sides of the congruence by $10$ and evaluating both sides modulo $997$: \\begin{align*}\n10\\cdot 100x &\\equiv 10\\cdot 1 \\pmod{997} \\\\\n1000x &\\equiv 10 \\pmod{997} \\\\\n3x &\\equiv 10 \\pmod{997}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWhy multiply by $10$? Well, as the computations above show, the result is to produce a congruence equivalent to the original congruence, but with a much smaller coefficient for $x$.\n\nFrom here, we could repeat the same strategy a couple more times; for example, multiplying both sides by $333$ would give $999x\\equiv 2x$ on the left side, reducing the coefficient of $x$ further. One more such step would reduce the coefficient of $x$ to $1$, giving us the solution.\n\nHowever, there is an alternative way of solving $3x\\equiv 10\\pmod{997}$. We note that we can rewrite this congruence as $3x\\equiv -987\\pmod{997}$ (since $10\\equiv -987\\pmod{997}$). Then $-987$ is a multiple of $3$: specifically, $-987 = 3\\cdot (-329)$, so multiplying both sides by $3^{-1}$ gives $$x \\equiv -329\\pmod{997}.$$ This is the solution set to the original congruence. The unique three-digit positive solution is $$x = -329 + 997 = \\boxed{668}.$$"
