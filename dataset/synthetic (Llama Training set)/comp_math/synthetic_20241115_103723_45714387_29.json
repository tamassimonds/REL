    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking how I would naturally approach it as a human. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting frequently, and checking my work as I go along.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I notice it's about a parabola given in the form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\). The graph shows:\n\n- **Vertex:** \\( (2, 1) \\)\n- **Point:** \\( (-4, -3) \\)\n\nAnd I'm asked to find the difference between the zeros of the quadratic, specifically \\( m - n \\) where \\( m > n \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Vertex Form:** Since the vertex is provided, I recall that parabolas can be expressed in vertex form: \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\( (h, k) \\) is the vertex. This might be helpful to identify \\( a \\).\n  \n- **Standard Form:** Alternatively, I could start with the standard form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) and use the given points to create equations.\n  \n- **Zeros and Vertex:** I remember that for parabolas, the sum and product of the zeros are related to the coefficients. This might help once I have more information.\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n\nWait, since the vertex is given, converting to vertex form seems like a good starting point. It might make finding \\( a \\) easier. But then again, I also need to know about the zeros, so perhaps I should consider both forms. Let's start with vertex form and see how it goes.\n\n### **Step 1: Converting to Vertex Form**\n\nGiven the vertex is \\( (2, 1) \\), the vertex form is:\n\n\\[\ny = a(x - 2)^2 + 1\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to find \\( a \\). To do this, I'll use the point \\( (-4, -3) \\) since it's another point on the parabola.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nPlugging \\( (-4, -3) \\) into the vertex form:\n\n\\[\n-3 = a(-4 - 2)^2 + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n-3 = a(-6)^2 + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n-3 = 36a + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n36a = -4\n\\]\n\\[\na = -\\frac{1}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so \\( a = -\\frac{1}{9} \\). This makes sense because the parabola opens downwards (the graph shows that).\n\n**Check:**\n\nQuick check: Does \\( a = -\\frac{1}{9} \\) seem reasonable? Yes, because that would make the parabola open downwards, fitting the graph.\n\n### **Step 2: Writing the Quadratic Equation**\n\nNow that I have \\( a \\), I can write the quadratic equation in vertex form:\n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{9}(x - 2)^2 + 1\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI prefer to convert this back to standard form since it's easier to identify the zeros and coefficients that way.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's expand this:\n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{9}(x^2 - 4x + 4) + 1\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{9}x^2 + \\frac{4}{9}x - \\frac{4}{9} + 1\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{9}x^2 + \\frac{4}{9}x + \\frac{5}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat looks good. Now I have the quadratic equation in standard form, which should make it easier to find the zeros.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes expanding back make sense? Let me briefly verify:  \n- Vertex form has \\( (x - 2)^2 \\): expanded gives \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 \\).\n- Multiplying by \\( -\\frac{1}{9} \\): coefficients seem right.\n- Adding 1 adjusts the constant term correctly.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Zeros of the Quadratic**\n\nNow, to find the zeros \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), I'll set the quadratic equation equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{9}x^2 + \\frac{4}{9}x + \\frac{5}{9} = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nHmm, dealing with fractions can be tricky. Maybe I should multiply the entire equation by -9 to eliminate the fraction and make calculations easier.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nMultiplying by -9:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 5 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat simplifies things nicely. Now, I can factor or use the quadratic formula to find the zeros.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes \\( x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0 \\) look correct? Multiplying back confirms it matches the original equation after clearing fractions. So, I'm good to proceed.\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\nNow, I'll solve \\( x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0 \\) using factoring.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLook for two numbers that multiply to -5 (constant term) and add up to -4 (coefficient of \\( x \\)).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe numbers are -5 and +1.\n\nSo, the equation factors to:\n\n\\[\n(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the zeros are:\n\n\\[\nx = 5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, did I check the signs correctly? Yes, -5 and +1 multiply to -5 and add to -4, so that works.\n\n**Check:**\n\nQuick check: Are the factored solutions correct? Multiplying \\( (x - 5)(x + 1) \\) back gives \\( x^2 - 4x - 5 \\), which matches the equation.\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying \\( m \\) and \\( n \\)**\n\nAccording to the problem, \\( m > n \\). So, the zeros are:\n\n\\[\nm = 5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense because 5 is greater than -1, fitting the condition \\( m > n \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this align with the graph? The parabola should cross the x-axis at these points. Looking back at the graph (if I could see it), does it intersect at \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\)? Assuming the graph is accurate, this should be correct.\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating \\( m - n \\)**\n\nFinally, to find \\( m - n \\):\n\n\\[\nm - n = 5 - (-1) = 5 + 1 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat calculation seems straightforward. Adding the negative makes sense. The difference between the zeros is 6.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes the difference make sense in the context? Yes, the distance between the zeros on the x-axis is 6 units.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nWait, let me double-check:  \n- The zeros are at \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\).\n- The difference \\( m - n = 6 \\) aligns with the graph.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming, reflecting, and checking at each step, I've determined that the difference between the zeros of the quadratic is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\nBy starting with vertex form, converting to standard form, and carefully solving for the zeros, I ensured each part of the process was correct before moving on to the next. This step-by-step approach helped catch any potential mistakes early and provided a clear path to the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The vertex form of a parabolic equation is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$. Since we are given that the vertex is at $(2,1)$, we know that $h=2$ and $k=1$. Plugging that into our equation gives $y=a(x-2)^2+1$. Now, substituting the other given point $(-4,-3)$ into the equation to solve for $a$, we have  \\begin{align*}\n-3&=a(-4-2)^2+1\\\\\n-4&=a(-6)^2\\\\\n-4&=36a\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{9}&=a\n\\end{align*} So the equation for the graphed parabola is $y=-\\frac{1}{9}(x-2)^2+1$. The zeros of the quadratic occur when $y=0$, so plugging that value into the equation to solve for $x$, we have $0=-\\frac{1}{9}(x-2)^2+1 \\Rightarrow (x-2)^2=9$. Taking the square root of both sides yields $x-2=\\pm 3$, so $x=5$ or $x=-1$. Thus, $m=5$ and $n=-1$, so $m-n=5-(-1)=\\boxed{6}$."
