    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would tackle a challenging problem in real life.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is about the function \\( *(n) = \\{ n-2, n+2, 2n, \\frac{n}{2} \\} \\). For example, \\( *(6) = \\{4, 8, 12, 3\\} \\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Set Operations:** This reminds me of problems involving sets and functions. Maybe it's about finding particular properties of these operations.\n- **Distinct Elements:** The goal is to have **exactly three distinct elements** in the output set. That\u2019s interesting. It implies some overlap among the results.\n- **Sample Given:** The example provided, \\( *(6) = \\{4, 8, 12, 3\\} \\), has four elements. So, to have exactly three, one of these must repeat or be equal to another.\n\n**Uncertainty:**\n\n- **Overlap Required:** I think there must be some overlap among the results to reduce the set from four to three distinct elements. But how?\n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Maybe looking at how these operations can produce overlapping values might help.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Algebraic Approach:** \n   - Set up equations where two or more operations yield the same result.\n   \n2. **Concrete Examples:**\n   - Plug in different integers to see patterns.\n\n3. **Graphical Representation:**\n   - Visualize the relationships between operations (though this might be overkill).\n\n4. **Combinatorial Thinking:**\n   - Consider all possible combinations and how they reduce.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The **algebraic approach** seems promising because it directly addresses finding overlaps.\n- **Concrete examples** could validate the algebra but might not be sufficient alone.\n- **Graphical** might be too complex and unnecessary here.\n- **Combinatorial thinking** could help in counting distinct integers later.\n\nI think starting with the **algebraic approach** is the best move. If I get stuck, I'll switch to concrete examples for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Set Up Equations for Overlaps**\n\nLet\u2019s assume that among \\( n-2, n+2, 2n, \\frac{n}{2} \\), two values are equal. This way, we reduce the set from four to three distinct elements.\n\n**Possible Equalities:**\n\n1. \\( n - 2 = n + 2 \\)\n2. \\( n - 2 = 2n \\)\n3. \\( n - 2 = \\frac{n}{2} \\)\n4. \\( n + 2 = 2n \\)\n5. \\( n + 2 = \\frac{n}{2} \\)\n6. \\( 2n = \\frac{n}{2} \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Immediate Realization:** Wait, \\( n - 2 = n + 2 \\) simplifies to \\( -2 = 2 \\), which is impossible. So, no solution there.\n- **Proceeding with Others:** Let\u2019s see which of the remaining equations have viable solutions.\n\n**Checking Equations:**\n\n1. **\\( n - 2 = 2n \\)**\n   - \\( n - 2 = 2n \\)\n   - \\( -2 = n \\)\n  \n   **Thought:** This gives \\( n = -2 \\). Let's check if it reduces the set to three distinct elements.\n\n2. **\\( n - 2 = \\frac{n}{2} \\)**\n   - \\( n - 2 = \\frac{n}{2} \\)\n   - Multiply both sides by 2: \\( 2n - 4 = n \\)\n   - \\( n = 4 \\)\n\n   **Thought:** This gives \\( n = 4 \\). Check if it works.\n\n3. **\\( n + 2 = 2n \\)**\n   - \\( n + 2 = 2n \\)\n   - \\( 2 = n \\)\n  \n   **Thought:** This gives \\( n = 2 \\). Check if it reduces the set.\n\n4. **\\( n + 2 = \\frac{n}{2} \\)**\n   - \\( n + 2 = \\frac{n}{2} \\)\n   - Multiply both sides by 2: \\( 2n + 4 = n \\)\n   - \\( n = -4 \\)\n\n   **Thought:** This gives \\( n = -4 \\). Check if it works.\n\n5. **\\( 2n = \\frac{n}{2} \\)**\n   - \\( 2n = \\frac{n}{2} \\)\n   - Multiply both sides by 2: \\( 4n = n \\)\n   - \\( 3n = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 0 \\)\n\n   **Thought:** This gives \\( n = 0 \\). Check its validity.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- We've found potential values: \\( n = -2, 0, 2, 4, -4 \\).\n- However, not all may lead to exactly three distinct elements.\n\n**Check for Overlap:**\n\nLet\u2019s see if these values indeed reduce the set to three distinct elements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Validate Each Candidate**\n\n**Candidate \\( n = -2 \\):**\n\n- \\( *(-2) = \\{ -2 - 2, -2 + 2, 2 \\times -2, \\frac{-2}{2} \\} = \\{ -4, 0, -4, -1 \\} \\)\n  \n**Distinct Elements:** \\( \\{ -4, 0, -1 \\} \\) \u2192 **Three Distinct Elements!**\n\n**Thought:** This works perfectly. \\( n = -2 \\) reduces the set to three distinct elements.\n\n---\n\n**Candidate \\( n = 0 \\):**\n\n- \\( *(0) = \\{ 0 - 2, 0 + 2, 2 \\times 0, \\frac{0}{2} \\} = \\{ -2, 2, 0, 0 \\} \\)\n  \n**Distinct Elements:** \\( \\{ -2, 2, 0 \\} \\) \u2192 **Three Distinct Elements!**\n\n**Thought:** This also works. \\( n = 0 \\) reduces the set to three distinct elements.\n\n---\n\n**Candidate \\( n = 2 \\):**\n\n- \\( *(2) = \\{ 2 - 2, 2 + 2, 2 \\times 2, \\frac{2}{2} \\} = \\{ 0, 4, 4, 1 \\} \\)\n  \n**Distinct Elements:** \\( \\{0, 4, 1\\} \\) \u2192 **Three Distinct Elements!**\n\n**Thought:** This works as well. \\( n = 2 \\) reduces the set to three distinct elements.\n\n---\n\n**Candidate \\( n = 4 \\):**\n\n- \\( *(4) = \\{ 4 - 2, 4 + 2, 2 \\times 4, \\frac{4}{2} \\} = \\{ 2, 6, 8, 2 \\} \\)\n  \n**Distinct Elements:** \\( \\{ 2, 6, 8 \\} \\) \u2192 **Three Distinct Elements!**\n\n**Thought:** This also works. \\( n = 4 \\) reduces the set to three distinct elements.\n\n---\n\n**Candidate \\( n = -4 \\):**\n\n- \\( *(-4) = \\{ -4 - 2, -4 + 2, 2 \\times -4, \\frac{-4}{2} \\} = \\{ -6, -2, -8, -2 \\} \\)\n  \n**Distinct Elements:** \\( \\{ -6, -2, -8 \\} \\) \u2192 **Three Distinct Elements!**\n\n**Thought:** This works too. \\( n = -4 \\) reduces the set to three distinct elements.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection**\n\n- All candidates \\( n = -2, 0, 2, 4, -4 \\) successfully reduce the set to three distinct elements.\n- **Initial Check:** At first, I might have thought only negative numbers work, but the positive and zero values also qualify.\n- **Consistency:** The approach seems consistent\u2014any \\( n \\) that creates an overlap between two operations results in three distinct elements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Consider the Possibility of Multiple Overlaps**\n\n**Thought:** Wait, perhaps there are cases where more than one pair of operations overlap, reducing the set to fewer than three distinct elements. Let's explore this.\n\n**Possible Multiple Overlaps:**\n\n1. **Two pairs equal:**\n   - Example: \\( n - 2 = n + 2 \\) and \\( n - 2 = 2n \\)\n   \n   **Reflection:** But as I noted earlier, \\( n - 2 = n + 2 \\) is impossible. So, there can't be two valid overlaps simultaneously.\n\n2. **Three operations equal:**\n   - Example: \\( n - 2 = 2n \\), \\( n - 2 = \\frac{n}{2} \\), and \\( n + 2 = 2n \\)\n   \n   **Reflection:** This is impossible as well because overlapping three operations would likely require more than three solutions, which isn't possible here.\n\n**Conclusion:** \n\n- **No Additional Overlaps:** Only single overlaps are possible without violating the uniqueness of solutions.\n- **Final Candidates:** Thus, the candidates we found initially remain valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Assess the Total Number of Distinct Integers \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought:** Now that we've identified valid \\( n \\) values, let's see how many distinct integers satisfy the condition.\n\n**List of Valid \\( n \\):**\n\n- \\( n = -2 \\)\n- \\( n = 0 \\)\n- \\( n = 2 \\)\n- \\( n = 4 \\)\n- \\( n = -4 \\)\n\n**Count:** \n\n- There are **five distinct integers**: \\( -4, -2, 0, 2, 4 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Correctness Check:** Initially, I might have assumed only negative integers work, but through exploration, I confirmed that positive integers and zero also qualify.\n- **Final Check:** It seems all possible cases are covered, and no additional candidates are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- By brainstorming and exploring different strategies, I identified that overlapping certain operations reduces the set to three distinct elements.\n- Validating each candidate ensured that all potential solutions were accounted for.\n- Considering multiple overlaps clarified that only single overlaps apply, simplifying the problem.\n- **Total Distinct Integers:** Ultimately, there are **five** distinct integers \\( n \\) for which \\( *(n) \\) has exactly three distinct elements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**There are 5 distinct integers \\( n \\) for which \\( *(n) \\) has exactly three distinct elements: \\( n = -4, -2, 0, 2, 4 \\).**\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration mirrors a human thought process, showcasing brainstorming, reflection, and corrections along the way.",

  "ground_truth": "To have three distinct elements, two of $n-2$, $n+2$, $2n$, and $\\frac{n}{2}$ must be equal. It is clear that $n-2$ can never equal $n+2$. However, any other equality pairing among the four is possible, so we simply check for distinctness. If $2n = \\frac{n}{2}$, the solution is $n= 0$. If $n+ 2 = 2n$, $n = 2$. If $n - 2 = 2n$, $n = -2$. If $\\frac{n}{2} = n - 2$, $n = 4$. Finally, if $\\frac{n}{2} = n+ 2$, $n = -4$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{5}$ such $n$."
