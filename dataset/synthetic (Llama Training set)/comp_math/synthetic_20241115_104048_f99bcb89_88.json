    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming along the way. The question is to simplify:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k - 3}{2} + 3k + 1 + \\frac{3k + 1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Initial Reaction:** This expression looks like a combination of fractions and linear terms. It reminds me of simplifying expressions by combining like terms and finding a common denominator.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Find a Common Denominator:** Combine the fractional terms first.\n  2. **Distribute and Combine:** Expand any terms that need it and then combine like terms.\n  3. **Rearrange the Expression:** Group similar terms together to simplify more easily.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n- **Strategy 1:** Finding a common denominator seems logical for dealing with fractions.\n- **Strategy 2:** Distributing might help if there are terms that need to be expanded, but I don\u2019t see any at first glance.\n- **Strategy 3:** Rearranging could make it easier to see like terms, especially mixing fractions with whole numbers.\n\n**Reflection:** Maybe starting with the common denominator approach would be effective, since dealing with fractions separately might prevent confusion later on.\n\n### **Step 1: Finding a Common Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Identify Fractions:** The terms with fractions are \\(\\frac{k - 3}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{3k + 1}{2}\\).\n- **Common Denominator:** Both fractions have a denominator of 2. So, combining them should be straightforward once we align them with the whole number terms.\n\n**Action:**\n- **Rewrite Whole Numbers as Fractions:** To combine everything easily, let\u2019s express the whole number terms as fractions with a denominator of 2.\n\n\\[\n3k + 1 = \\frac{6k}{2} + \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{6k + 2}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Now all terms have a denominator of 2, which should make combining them simpler.\n\n### **Step 2: Combining Fractional Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Combine Fractions:** With a common denominator, I can add or subtract numerators directly.\n\n**Action:**\n- **Add the Fractional Terms:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k - 3}{2} + \\frac{3k + 1}{2} = \\frac{(k - 3) + (3k + 1)}{2} = \\frac{4k - 2}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Simplifying \\(\\frac{4k - 2}{2}\\) gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4k}{2} - \\frac{2}{2} = 2k - 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** That looks correct. Reducing the fraction simplifies it neatly.\n\n### **Step 3: Adding the Whole Number Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Combine Whole Numbers with the Simplified Fraction:** Now, add the simplified expression from the fractions to the whole number term left in the original expression.\n\n**Action:**\n- **Write the Expression:** \n\n\\[\n2k - 1 + 3k + 1\n\\]\n\n- **Combine Like Terms:**\n\n\\[\n(2k + 3k) + (-1 + 1) = 5k + 0 = 5k\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Adding coefficients of \\(k\\) gives 5k, and the constant terms cancel out.\n\n**Reflection:** This simplification makes sense. The constant terms neutralize each other, and only the \\(k\\)-terms remain.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check and Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Review the Steps:** Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one and that no mistakes were made in combining terms.\n\n**Action:**\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - **Fractional Simplification:** \\(\\frac{k - 3}{2} + \\frac{3k + 1}{2} = \\frac{4k - 2}{2} = 2k - 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - **Combining with Whole Numbers:** \\(2k - 1 + 3k + 1 = 5k + 0 = 5k\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. The approach was correct, and the answer simplifies neatly to \\(5k\\).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k - 3}{2} + 3k + 1 + \\frac{3k + 1}{2} = 5k\n\\]\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Strategy Effectiveness:** Starting with finding a common denominator was effective in simplifying the fractional parts first, making it easier to combine with the whole number terms.\n- **Alternative Approaches:** Initially considered distributing or rearranging, but finding a common denominator streamlined the process.\n- **Key Learning:** Ensuring all terms are on the same denominator simplifies adding fractions significantly.\n- **Mistakes to Avoid:** Overlooking the need to convert whole numbers into fractions can lead to confusion when combining terms.\n\nBy reflecting and checking at each step, I ensured the correctness of the solution and maintained clarity throughout the process.",
