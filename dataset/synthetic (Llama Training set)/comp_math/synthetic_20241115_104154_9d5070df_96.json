Perfect squares are numbers like \\(1, 4, 9, 16, \\ldots\\) where all prime factors have even exponents in their prime factorization.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Prime Factorization:** Break down each number into its prime factors, then see the overall exponents to identify perfect square factors.\n  2. **List All Factors:** Although this might be tedious, I could list all factors of the product and check which ones are perfect squares.\n  3. **Use Properties of Exponents:** Maybe there's a property that can simplify counting perfect squares without listing every factor.\n  \n- **Reflection:** The prime factorization method seems the most systematic and likely the quickest way to identify perfect square factors. Listing all factors might be impractical due to the size of the product, so I'll start with prime factorization.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Prime Factorization of Each Number**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nI need to break down each even number into its prime components. This will help me understand the exponents of primes in the entire product.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\n- \\(2 = 2^1\\)\n- \\(4 = 2^2\\)\n- \\(6 = 2^1 \\times 3^1\\)\n- \\(8 = 2^3\\)\n- \\(10 = 2^1 \\times 5^1\\)\n- \\(12 = 2^2 \\times 3^1\\)\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nAt this point, I can see that all numbers have \\(2\\) as a prime factor, and some also include \\(3\\) and \\(5\\). This is crucial because for a number to be a perfect square, all prime factors must have even exponents.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Combine Exponents to Find Total Prime Factorization**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to add up the exponents of each prime factor across all numbers to see the overall composition.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\nLet's add the exponents for each prime:\n\n- **Prime \\(2\\):**\n  - From \\(2\\): \\(1\\)\n  - From \\(4\\): \\(2\\)\n  - From \\(6\\): \\(1\\)\n  - From \\(8\\): \\(3\\)\n  - From \\(10\\): \\(1\\)\n  - From \\(12\\): \\(2\\)\n  \n  **Total:** \\(1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 10\\)\n\n- **Prime \\(3\\):**\n  - From \\(6\\): \\(1\\)\n  - From \\(12\\): \\(1\\)\n  \n  **Total:** \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)\n\n- **Prime \\(5\\):**\n  - From \\(10\\): \\(1\\)\n  \n  **Total:** \\(1\\)\n\nSo, the complete prime factorization of the product is:\n\\[ \n2^{10} \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \n\\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014**does that make sense?** Adding up the exponents seems straightforward, but let me double-check:\n\n- Prime \\(2\\): \\(1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 10\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- Prime \\(3\\): \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- Prime \\(5\\): Only \\(10\\) has it, so \\(1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Everything checks out.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Identifying Perfect Square Factors**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nA perfect square must have all prime factors raised to even exponents. So, I need to see which combinations of \\(2^{10}\\), \\(3^2\\), and \\(5^1\\) can form perfect squares.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\n- **For Prime \\(2\\):** Exponent can be \\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\) (all even up to \\(10\\)).\n  \n- **For Prime \\(3\\):** Exponent can be \\(0, 2\\) (since \\(2\\) is the highest even exponent).\n  \n- **For Prime \\(5\\):** Exponent can only be \\(0\\) (because \\(1\\) is odd, and we need even exponents).\n\n### **Possible Combinations:**\n\nLet's list the possible exponents:\n\n- **Prime \\(2\\):** \\(0\\) to \\(10\\) in steps of \\(2\\) \u2192 \\(6\\) options: \\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\)\n  \n- **Prime \\(3\\):** \\(0, 2\\) \u2192 \\(2\\) options\n  \n- **Prime \\(5\\):** \\(0\\) \u2192 \\(1\\) option\n\n**Total Combinations:**\n\\[ \n6 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 12 \n\\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n**Does this make sense?** Let's think it through:\n\n- Each prime factor contributes to the exponent combinations.\n- Prime \\(2\\) has multiple even exponents,\n- Prime \\(3\\) has two choices,\n- Prime \\(5\\) can only be \\(0\\).\n\n**The multiplication of these options gives the total number of perfect square factors.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Enumerating the Perfect Square Factors**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nTo be more concrete, let's list a few perfect square factors to ensure our calculations are correct.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\nLet's pick exponents for each prime that are even:\n\n- \\(2^0 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^0 = 1\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^0 = 4\\)\n- \\(2^4 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^0 = 16\\)\n- \\(2^0 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^0 = 9\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^0 = 36\\)\n- \\(2^{10} \\times 3^0 \\times 5^0 = 1024\\)\n- And so on...\n\n**Wait:** Does this seem right?\n\n**Let me double-check:** \n\n- Each factor is indeed a perfect square (exponents are even).\n- The combination counts align with the total number of perfect square factors.\n\n**It's reassuring.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Final Reflection and Answer**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nWe've methodically broken down the problem, counted the possible exponents forming perfect squares, and even verified by listing some factors. This suggests our initial approach is correct.\n\n### **Final Calculation:**\n\nTotal number of perfect square factors:\n\\[ \n12 \n\\]\n\n### **Answer:**\n\n**There are 12 perfect square factors of \\(2 \\times 4 \\times 6 \\times 8 \\times 10 \\times 12\\).**\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying calculations along the way, we've arrived at a consistent and confident answer. This process ensured that even if an initial thought led to uncertainty, adjusting the approach and checking work led to the correct solution.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Prime Factorization** was crucial in understanding the exponents.\n- **Combinatorial Counting** helped in determining the number of perfect square factors.\n- **Verification Steps** ensured the correctness of the approach and the answer.\n\n**Final Reflection:** Thinking through each part of the problem, checking work frequently, and being open to adjusting strategies led to a reliable solution. This mirrors a human thought process, complete with checks, balances, and reflections.",

  "ground_truth": "We prime factor the given product as $2^{10}\\cdot 3^2\\cdot5.$ Recall that a number is a perfect square if and only if all of its prime factors are raised to an even power; so $f$ is a factor if and only if $f = 2^{2a}\\cdot 3^{2b}$ for $0\\leq 2a\\leq 10$ and $0\\leq 2b\\leq 2.$ So we have $6$ choices for $a$ and $2$ choices for $b,$ leading to a total of $6\\cdot 2 = \\boxed{12}$ possibilities."
