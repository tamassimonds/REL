    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this probability problem step by step, thinking through different strategies, reflecting on their appropriateness, and checking if we're on the right track. I'll brainstorm various approaches, make adjustments as needed, and ensure that my thought process resembles human-like exploration, complete with doubts, insights, and corrections.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I think, \"Okay, we're dealing with probability here\u2014rolling a die and tossing a coin. The win condition involves both elements: the die showing a 1 or 6 and the coin showing heads.\" \n\nInitially, I'm reminded of problems involving independent events and calculating combined probabilities. However, the requirement to win **before the fourth turn** adds a layer of complexity. It makes me consider both the probabilities of winning in the first three turns and the possibility of failing each turn.\n\nThis setup seems similar to calculating probabilities in games with multiple rounds, where you want to find the chance of an event occurring within a certain number of attempts.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate the Probability of Winning in a Single Turn:**\n   - Determine the chances of rolling a 1 or 6 **and** flipping heads on the coin.\n\n2. **Use Complement Probability:**\n   - Instead of calculating the probability of winning within three turns directly, calculate the probability of **not winning** in all three turns and subtract from 1.\n\n3. **Geometric Series Approach:**\n   - Consider that the probability of winning can be seen as a series of independent events occurring within a set number of trials.\n\n4. **Simulate Multiple Turns:**\n   - Although not practical here, simulating multiple turns could provide an intuitive understanding (but I'll stick to analytical methods for accuracy).\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Probability of Winning in a Single Turn**\n\nLet's start by calculating the probability of winning in one turn.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The die and coin toss are independent events.\n- I need the probability of rolling a 1 or 6 **and** flipping heads.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Probability of rolling a 1 or 6:  \n  \\( P(\\text{Die}) = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n  \n- Probability of tossing heads:  \n  \\( P(\\text{Coin}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n  \n- Combined probability for a single turn:  \n  \\( P(\\text{Win in One Turn}) = P(\\text{Die}) \\times P(\\text{Coin}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis makes sense because both events need to occur simultaneously for a win. The probabilities multiply since they're independent.\n\n### **Check: Does This Approach Make Sense?**\nSo far, so good. I've determined the probability of winning in a single turn. Now, I need to consider how this probability applies over multiple turns, specifically **before the fourth turn**.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Calculate Probability of Not Winning in All Three Turns (Complementary Probability)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Instead of directly calculating the probability of winning in one, two, or three turns, I'll calculate the probability of **not winning** in all three turns and subtract from 1.\n  \n**Calculations:**\n- Probability of **not winning** in a single turn:  \n  \\( P(\\text{Not Win in One Turn}) = 1 - P(\\text{Win in One Turn}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n  \n- Probability of **not winning** in all three turns:  \n  \\( P(\\text{Not Win in Three Turns}) = \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{216} \\)\n  \n- Probability of **winning within the first three turns:**  \n  \\( P(\\text{Win in Three or Less Turns}) = 1 - P(\\text{Not Win in Three Turns}) = 1 - \\frac{125}{216} = \\frac{216}{216} - \\frac{125}{216} = \\frac{91}{216} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis approach feels intuitive. By calculating the probability of the complementary event (not winning at all in three turns), I can directly find the probability of winning within that timeframe.\n\n### **Check: Is This Probability Reasonable?**\nThe probability \\( \\frac{91}{216} \\) simplifies to approximately 0.4213, which seems reasonable for a game with multiple attempts where the winning condition isn't exceedingly rare.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Geometric Series Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Consider the scenario as a geometric series where each turn represents a trial with a constant probability of success.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let\u2019s denote the probability of winning in one turn as \\( p = \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n- The probability of winning at least once in \\( n \\) turns is given by the formula:\n  \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Win at Least Once in } n \\text{ Turns}) = 1 - (1 - p)^n = 1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^n\n  \\]\n  \n- For \\( n = 3 \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Win in Three or Less Turns}) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3 = 1 - \\frac{125}{216} = \\frac{91}{216}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis method aligns with the complementary probability approach I used earlier. It confirms the probability is \\( \\frac{91}{216} \\).\n\n### **Check: Does This Approach Confirm the Previous Result?**\nYes, both methods yield the same probability, reinforcing the correctness of the solution. Consistency across different strategies is a good indicator that the solution is correct.\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies\u2014calculating the probability of winning in a single turn, using complementary probability, and applying the geometric series formula\u2014I arrived at the same probability:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{91}{216}}\n\\]\n\nReflecting throughout the process ensured that each step made sense, and checking the results confirmed the accuracy. This approach mirrors human problem-solving, where brainstorming, testing different methods, and continuously validating steps lead to a reliable solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The probability of rolling 1 or 6 is $\\frac{2}{6}$, and the probability of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game will end on the first turn is $\\frac{2}{6}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{6}$.  The probability that the game will not end on the first turn is $1-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{5}{6}$.  Given that the game is still going after 1 turn, the probability that the game will not end on the second turn is also $\\frac{5}{6}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game does not end by the end of the second turn is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2$.  Similarly, the probability that the game is still going after 3 turns is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3=\\frac{125}{216}$.  So the probability that the game is over by the end of the third turn is $1-\\dfrac{125}{216}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{91}{216}}$."
