    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would tackle a problem naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**\"Two numbers are independently selected from the set of positive integers less than or equal to 5. What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers is greater than their product? Express your answer as a common fraction.\"**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Okay, we're dealing with positive integers from 1 to 5. The goal is to find the probability that the sum of two selected numbers is greater than their product.\n\n- **Reflection:** This reminds me of problems involving comparing sums and products, similar to inequalities. But then again, probabilities with discrete sets make me think about listing all possible outcomes.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure how to start. Should I list all combinations first? Or maybe there's a pattern or property I can use to simplify?\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Listing All Possible Outcomes:**\n   - **Idea:** Create a table with all possible pairs and see where the sum is greater than the product.\n   - **Pros:** This method guarantees that I consider all possibilities.\n   - **Cons:** It might be time-consuming, especially if the set were larger, but since we're only dealing with numbers up to 5, it seems manageable.\n\n2. **Using Inequalities:**\n   - **Idea:** Manipulate the inequality \\( a + b > a \\times b \\) algebraically to see if it simplifies.\n   - **Pros:** Potentially a quicker way to find a general solution.\n   - **Cons:** Might get complicated; algebra mistakes could lead me astray.\n\n3. **Symmetry and Patterns:**\n   - **Idea:** Look for symmetrical properties or patterns in the numbers to reduce the number of cases.\n   - **Pros:** Can shorten the process if such patterns exist.\n   - **Cons:** I\u2019m not sure if symmetry applies directly here.\n\n4. **Probability of Events:**\n   - **Idea:** Calculate the probability by considering favorable outcomes over total outcomes.\n   - **Pros:** Aligns with the probability definition.\n   - **Cons:** Still requires knowing the number of favorable cases.\n\n### **Decision on Approach**\n\nGiven that the set is small (1 to 5), I think **listing all possible outcomes** is the most straightforward and reliable method. It might take a bit of time, but it ensures that I don't miss any cases. If this method feels too cumbersome as I start, I can reconsider and perhaps look for patterns or simplify from there.\n\n### **Step 1: List All Possible Outcomes**\n\nLet's create a table with all possible pairs \\( (a, b) \\) where each \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n+ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & (1,1) & (1,2) & (1,3) & (1,4) & (1,5) \\\\\n2 & (2,1) & (2,2) & (2,3) & (2,4) & (2,5) \\\\\n3 & (3,1) & (3,2) & (3,3) & (3,4) & (3,5) \\\\\n4 & (4,1) & (4,2) & (4,3) & (4,4) & (4,5) \\\\\n5 & (5,1) & (5,2) & (5,3) & (5,4) & (5,5) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n- **Total Outcomes:** There are \\( 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\) possible pairs since each number is chosen independently.\n\n- **Reflection:** Okay, that seems right. Each number has 5 options, so the total number of combinations is 25.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify Favorable Outcomes**\n\nNow, I'll go through each pair and check where the sum is greater than the product: \\( a + b > a \\times b \\).\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** This part will be a bit tedious, but it's straightforward. I need to calculate the sum and product for each pair and compare them.\n\n- **Strategy:** I'll list each pair, compute the sum and product, and note whether the inequality holds.\n\n#### **Pair Analysis**\n\nLet's start examining each row:\n\n1. **First Row (a = 1):**\n   - (1,1): \\(1 + 1 = 2\\); \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\) \u21d2 \\(2 > 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - (1,2): \\(1 + 2 = 3\\); \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\) \u21d2 \\(3 > 2\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - (1,3): \\(1 + 3 = 4\\); \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\) \u21d2 \\(4 > 3\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - (1,4): \\(1 + 4 = 5\\); \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\) \u21d2 \\(5 > 4\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - (1,5): \\(1 + 5 = 6\\); \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) \u21d2 \\(6 > 5\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n   **All pairs** have the sum greater than the product.\n\n2. **Second Row (a = 2):**\n   - (2,1): \\(2 + 1 = 3\\); \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) \u21d2 \\(3 > 2\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - (2,2): \\(2 + 2 = 4\\); \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) \u21d2 \\(4 = 4\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n   - (2,3): \\(2 + 3 = 5\\); \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) \u21d2 \\(5 < 6\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n   - (2,4): \\(2 + 4 = 6\\); \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) \u21d2 \\(6 < 8\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n   - (2,5): \\(2 + 5 = 7\\); \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) \u21d2 \\(7 < 10\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n\n   **Only one** pair (2,1) satisfies the condition.\n\n3. **Third Row (a = 3):**\n   - (3,1): \\(3 + 1 = 4\\); \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\) \u21d2 \\(4 > 3\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - (3,2): \\(3 + 2 = 5\\); \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) \u21d2 \\(5 < 6\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n   - (3,3): \\(3 + 3 = 6\\); \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) \u21d2 \\(6 < 9\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n   - (3,4): \\(3 + 4 = 7\\); \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) \u21d2 \\(7 < 12\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n   - (3,5): \\(3 + 5 = 8\\); \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) \u21d2 \\(8 < 15\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n\n   **Only one** pair (3,1) satisfies the condition.\n\n4. **Fourth Row (a = 4):**\n   - (4,1): \\(4 + 1 = 5\\); \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\) \u21d2 \\(5 > 4\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - (4,2): \\(4 + 2 = 6\\); \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) \u21d2 \\(6 < 8\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n   - (4,3): \\(4 + 3 = 7\\); \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) \u21d2 \\(7 < 12\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n   - (4,4): \\(4 + 4 = 8\\); \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) \u21d2 \\(8 < 16\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n   - (4,5): \\(4 + 5 = 9\\); \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\) \u21d2 \\(9 < 20\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n\n   **Only one** pair (4,1) satisfies the condition.\n\n5. **Fifth Row (a = 5):**\n   - (5,1): \\(5 + 1 = 6\\); \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\) \u21d2 \\(6 > 5\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - (5,2): \\(5 + 2 = 7\\); \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) \u21d2 \\(7 < 10\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n   - (5,3): \\(5 + 3 = 8\\); \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\) \u21d2 \\(8 < 15\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n   - (5,4): \\(5 + 4 = 9\\); \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) \u21d2 \\(9 < 20\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n   - (5,5): \\(5 + 5 = 10\\); \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) \u21d2 \\(10 < 25\\) \u2716\ufe0f\n\n   **Only one** pair (5,1) satisfies the condition.\n\n- **Summary of Favorable Outcomes:**\n\n  | Pair     | Sum | Product | Sum > Product? |\n  |----------|-----|---------|-----------------|\n  | (1,1)    | 2   | 1       | \u2714\ufe0f               |\n  | (1,2)    | 3   | 2       | \u2714\ufe0f               |\n  | (1,3)    | 4   | 3       | \u2714\ufe0f               |\n  | (1,4)    | 5   | 4       | \u2714\ufe0f               |\n  | (1,5)    | 6   | 5       | \u2714\ufe0f               |\n  | (2,1)    | 3   | 2       | \u2714\ufe0f               |\n  | (3,1)    | 4   | 3       | \u2714\ufe0f               |\n  | (4,1)    | 5   | 4       | \u2714\ufe0f               |\n  | (5,1)    | 6   | 5       | \u2714\ufe0f               |\n\n- **Total Favorable Outcomes:** 9\n\n- **Reflection:** Out of 25 total pairs, 9 satisfy the condition. That seems like a small but reasonable number. I\u2019ll double-check these pairs to ensure correctness.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Wait, considering that \\( a = 1 \\) always satisfies \\( a + b > a \\times b \\) regardless of \\( b \\), and there are five such pairs (1,1) to (1,5), it makes sense that a significant portion of the favorable outcomes comes from there.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe probability \\( P \\) is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\\text{Total Outcomes}} = \\frac{9}{25}\n\\]\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Solution**\n\n- **Cross-checking:** Let me quickly review the pairs I marked as favorable. All seem correct, and the logic holds that if \\( a = 1 \\), the sum will always be greater than the product, as addition with 1 always exceeds multiplication by 1.\n\n- **Alternate Approach:** Considering the initial brainstorming, perhaps I could have noticed early on that any pair involving 1 would always satisfy the inequality. This realization could have simplified the process, but listing all outcomes ensured no cases were missed.\n\n- **Final Reflection:** The answer feels consistent with the problem's requirements. The method is exhaustive given the small sample space, and the probability is expressed correctly as a common fraction.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{9}{25}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**In Summary:**\n\n- I started by brainstorming different strategies, settling on listing all possible pairs due to the manageable size of the set.\n- By systematically checking each pair, I identified 9 favorable outcomes where the sum exceeds the product.\n- The probability calculation was straightforward, resulting in \\( \\frac{9}{25} \\).\n- Throughout, I reflected and checked my work to ensure the accuracy of each step, adapting the approach as needed.",
