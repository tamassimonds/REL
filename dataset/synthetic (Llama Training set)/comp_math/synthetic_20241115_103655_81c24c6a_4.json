    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it as I naturally would, starting with brainstorming and exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and adjusting my path as needed.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst off, let's make sure I really grasp what's being asked. The user wants to know **how many pictures Trilisa needs to take so that at least one picture turns out successfully with a probability of at least $\\frac{3}{4}$.** \n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** Okay, so Trilisa has a probability of $\\frac{1}{5}$ for each picture to turn out. She wants the overall chance of at least one picture being successful to be $\\frac{3}{4}$. This reminds me of probability problems involving complementary events, where it's often easier to calculate the probability of the opposite happening.\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nLooking at the problem, I can think of a few possible approaches:\n\n1. **Complementary Probability Method:** Calculate the probability of all pictures failing and subtract that from 1.\n   \n2. **Direct Probability Calculation:** Calculate the probability of at least one picture turning out directly by considering multiple scenarios.\n\n3. **Geometric Series Approach:** Since each attempt is independent, maybe there's a series involved.\n\n4. **Simulation or Trial and Error:** Take a guess and check if the probability meets the requirement, adjusting the number of pictures accordingly.\n\n- **Reflection:** The Complementary Probability Method seems like the most straightforward and commonly used approach for this type of problem. Direct calculation might get messy with multiple scenarios, and using a geometric series feels like overkill. Simulation could work but isn't practical without computational tools.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Complementary Probability Method**\n\nGiven that the complementary approach seems best, let's proceed with it.\n\n- **Thought Process:** If the probability of a picture turning out is $\\frac{1}{5}$, then the probability of it not turning out is $1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$. \n\n- **Brainstorming:** Wait, let me think. If she takes **n** pictures, the probability that **all** n pictures fail is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n$. Therefore, the probability that **at least one** picture succeeds is $1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n$.\n\n- **Formula Setup:** We want this probability to be at least $\\frac{3}{4}$:\n  \n  \\[\n  1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n \\geq \\frac{3}{4}\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifying this:\n\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n \\leq \\frac{1}{4}\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because if the probability of all pictures failing is less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$, the probability of at least one succeeding is at least $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Inequality**\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest integer value of **n** that satisfies this inequality.\n\n- **Thinking:** To solve $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n \\leq \\frac{1}{4}$, I can take logarithms.\n\n- **Equation:** \n\n  \\[\n  n \\log\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) \\leq \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating Logarithms:**\n\n  - **Logarithm of Fractions:** Recall that $\\log\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = \\log(a) - \\log(b)$.\n    \n    \\[\n    \\log\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = \\log(4) - \\log(5)\n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\log(1) - \\log(4) = 0 - \\log(4) = -\\log(4)\n    \\]\n\n  - **Values:** Let's use approximate values:\n    \n    - $\\log(4) \\approx 0.602$\n    - $\\log(5) \\approx 0.699$\n    \n    \\[\n    \\log\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) \\approx 0.602 - 0.699 = -0.097\n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\approx -0.602\n    \\]\n    \n- **Plugging In:**\n\n  \\[\n  n (-0.097) \\leq -0.602\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating n:**\n\n  \\[\n  n \\geq \\frac{-0.602}{-0.097} \\approx 6.2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Since **n** must be an integer, the smallest possible value is **n = 7**.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's double-check if **n = 7** indeed satisfies the original condition.\n\n- **Checking Probability with n = 7:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^7 \\approx 0.2097152\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  1 - 0.2097152 \\approx 0.7902848\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  0.7902848 \\geq \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n  \\]\n  \n- **Again for n = 6:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^6 \\approx 0.262144\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  1 - 0.262144 \\approx 0.737856\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  0.737856 < 0.75\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:** **n = 7** is indeed the minimum number of pictures Trilisa needs to take to ensure that the probability of at least one picture turning out is at least $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Does the Solution Make Sense?** Yes, by taking logarithms and confirming with actual probability calculations for **n = 6** and **n = 7**, it's clear that **n = 7** is the correct and smallest integer that meets the requirement.\n\n- **Was the Approach Correct?** The Complementary Probability Method worked well here. Initially, I considered different strategies, but this one provided a straightforward path to the solution.\n\n- **Mistakes or Insights:** At first, I thought about directly calculating the probability of at least one picture succeeding through multiple scenarios, but quickly realized that the complementary method simplifies the problem significantly. Taking logarithms also helped in finding the exact number of pictures needed efficiently.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nTrilisa needs to take **7 pictures** to ensure that the probability of at least one turning out successfully is **at least $\\frac{3}{4}$**.",

  "ground_truth": "The probability that at least one picture turns out is $1$ minus the probability that all the pictures do not turn out.  Since the probability that one picture will not turn out is $\\frac{4}{5}$, the probability that $n$ pictures all do not turn out is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n$.  So we want\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n<\\frac{1}{4}\\Rightarrow 4^{n+1}<5^n$$\n\nWe see that $4^7>5^6$, but $4^8<5^7$.  Thus the smallest allowable value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
