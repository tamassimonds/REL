    "working_out": "## Brainstorming and First Thoughts\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. **Let \\( f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\) be a function satisfying \\( f(x)f(y) = f(x - y) \\). Find all possible values of \\( f(2017) \\).**\n\nWhen I first read this, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Functional Equations:** This looks like a functional equation I've encountered before. I remember dealing with equations where the function relates values at different inputs through operations like addition or multiplication.\n\n2. **Constants and Zero:** Maybe \\( f(x) \\) is a constant function or possibly zero everywhere? That could be a starting point.\n\n3. **Exploring Linear Functions:** Perhaps \\( f(x) \\) is a linear function like \\( f(x) = ax + b \\). Although, I recall that linear functions might not always satisfy such multiplicative conditions.\n\n4. **Using Specific Values:** Plugging in specific values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) could help unveil the nature of \\( f \\).\n\n5. **Checking Symmetry:** The equation involves \\( f(x)f(y) = f(x - y) \\), which might suggest some symmetry or invariance properties.\n\nInitially, I feel uncertain about the exact form \\( f(x) \\) should take, but I'm inclined to start by exploring constant functions and see where that leads. If that doesn't work, I'll pivot to trying linear functions or perhaps looking for an identity element.\n\n## Step 1: **Exploring Constant Functions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's assume \\( f(x) \\) is a constant function, say \\( f(x) = c \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\). This seems like a straightforward starting point.\n\n**Calculations:**\nPlug \\( f(x) = c \\) into the given equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x)f(y) = f(x - y) \\\\\nc \\cdot c = f(x - y) \\\\\nc^2 = c\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait a minute... If \\( c^2 = c \\), then \\( c(c - 1) = 0 \\). This implies that \\( c = 0 \\) or \\( c = 1 \\).\n\nSo, possible constant functions are:\n- \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\)\n- \\( f(x) = 1 \\) for all \\( x \\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **For \\( f(x) = 0 \\):**\n  \\[\n  0 \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{(true for all } x, y\\text{)}\n  \\]\n- **For \\( f(x) = 1 \\):**\n  \\[\n  1 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\quad \\text{(true for all } x, y\\text{)}\n  \\]\n\nBoth satisfy the equation.\n\n**Natural Check:**\nHmm, I think constant functions work. But maybe there are non-constant solutions I should consider. Let's see if linear functions work or if there's another type.\n\n## Step 2: **Exploring Linear Functions \\( f(x) = ax + b \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf constant functions are viable solutions, perhaps linear functions are too. But given the multiplicative nature of the equation, I'm skeptical. Still, let's test it.\n\n**Calculations:**\nAssume \\( f(x) = ax + b \\). Plug this into the equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x)f(y) = f(x - y) \\\\\n(ax + b)(ay + b) = a(x - y) + b \\\\\na^2xy + aby + abx + b^2 = ax - ay + b\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, this expands to:\n\n\\[\na^2xy + abx + aby + b^2 = ax - ay + b\n\\]\n\nFor this to hold for all \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the coefficients must match on both sides. Let's compare them.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **Left Side:** \\( a^2xy + abx + aby + b^2 \\)\n- **Right Side:** \\( ax - ay + b \\)\n\nLet\u2019s match coefficients for \\( xy \\), \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and the constant term:\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\( xy \\):**\n   \\[\n   a^2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 0\n   \\]\n   \n   But if \\( a = 0 \\), \\( f(x) = b \\), which is a constant function we've already considered.\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\( x \\):**\n   If \\( a \\neq 0 \\), then:\n   \\[\n   ab = a \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 1\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Coefficient of \\( y \\):**\n   \\[\n   ab = -a \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = -1\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\nWait, we end up with conflicting values for \\( b \\):\n- \\( b = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -1 \\)\n\nThis suggests that \\( f(x) \\) cannot be a non-constant linear function because it leads to contradictions.\n\n**Quick Check:**\nIf \\( f(x) = x + 1 \\):\n\\[\nf(x)f(y) = (x + 1)(y + 1) = xy + x + y + 1 \\\\\nf(x - y) = (x - y) + 1 = x - y + 1\n\\]\nDoesn\u2019t match because \\( xy + x + y + 1 \\neq x - y + 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLinear functions other than constant ones don't satisfy the equation.\n\n## Step 3: **Considering the Zero Function \\( f(x) = 0 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nEarlier, we found that \\( f(x) = 0 \\) is a valid solution. But let's dig deeper to ensure there are no other non-constant solutions.\n\n**Calculations:**\nLet's assume \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x)f(y) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(x - y) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis satisfies the equation. So, \\( f(x) = 0 \\) is indeed a solution. But are there more solutions?\n\n## Step 4: **Exploring Non-Constant Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nPerhaps there's a non-constant function that satisfies the equation. Let's brainstorm:\n\n1. **Periodic Functions:** Maybe \\( f(x) \\) is periodic.\n2. **Odd Functions:** Perhaps \\( f(x) = -f(-x) \\).\n3. **Exponential Functions:** Functions like \\( e^x \\) or \\( e^{-x} \\) might be worth exploring.\n\nGiven that nonlinear functions haven't worked so far, especially with conflicting coefficients, I'm inclined to think non-constant solutions might be rare or non-existent. Still, let's explore.\n\n**Exploring Periodic Functions:**\nAssume \\( f(x) \\) is periodic with period \\( T \\), meaning \\( f(x + T) = f(x) \\).\n\nBut if \\( f(x) \\) is periodic and satisfies \\( f(x)f(y) = f(x - y) \\), then:\n\n\\[\nf(x)f(y) = f(x - y) \\\\\n\\implies f(x)f(y) = f(x - y + T) \\quad \\text{(using periodicity)}\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that either:\n- \\( f(x)f(y) = f(x - y) = f(x - y + T) \\), which imposes a strong condition on \\( f \\), or\n- The only solution is trivial, as periodic functions might not satisfy multiplicative conditions across all reals.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems too restrictive. I think periodic functions would struggle to satisfy such an equation universally.\n\n**Exploring Odd Functions:**\nAssume \\( f(x) = -f(-x) \\). Let's see if this helps.\n\nPlug into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x)f(y) = f(x - y)\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't immediately simplify things, and given that constants already work, I\u2019m not sure this leads anywhere new.\n\n**Reflection:**\nOdd functions might not align with the multiplicative structure needed here.\n\n**Exploring Exponential Functions:**\nMaybe something like \\( f(x) = e^{kx} \\).\n\nPlug into the equation:\n\n\\[\ne^{kx}e^{ky} = e^{k(x - y)} \\\\\ne^{k(x + y)} = e^{k(x - y)} \\\\\nk(x + y) = k(x - y)\n\\]\n\nFor this to hold for all \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), \\( k \\) must be zero:\n\n\\[\nk(x + y) = k(x - y) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad kx + ky = kx - ky \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2ky = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k = 0 \\) or \\( y = 0 \\). But since \\( y \\) is arbitrary, \\( k \\) must be zero, leading us back to the constant function \\( f(x) = 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNon-constant functions seem to lead back to constants or contradictions.\n\n## Step 5: **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAfter exploring constant functions and realizing that non-constant solutions lead to contradictions or revert back to constants, I think I can confidently conclude that the only valid solutions are constant functions: \\( f(x) = 0 \\) and \\( f(x) = 1 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\nLet's verify:\n\n1. **For \\( f(x) = 0 \\):**\n   \\[\n   f(x)f(y) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(x - y) = 0\n   \\]\n   Satisfies the equation.\n\n2. **For \\( f(x) = 1 \\):**\n   \\[\n   f(x)f(y) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(x - y) = 1\n   \\]\n   Satisfies the equation.\n\n**Quick Reflection:**\nBoth \\( f(x) = 0 \\) and \\( f(x) = 1 \\) work consistently without leading to contradictions. Non-constant solutions don\u2019t seem to hold under rigorous testing.\n\n**Answering the User Query:**\nThe possible values of \\( f(2017) \\) are **0, 1.**\n\n---\n\n**Overall Reflection:**\nThis was an interesting problem that began with exploring constant functions, which worked, but led to realizing that non-constant solutions either return to constants or introduce contradictions. Checking each approach allowed me to confirm that only constant functions satisfy the given functional equation.",
