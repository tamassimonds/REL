    "working_out": "Sure, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a human thought process that's messy and reflective. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, check my work often, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, the problem asks for the possible values of \\( m \\) such that the quadratic equation \\( 2x^2 + mx + 8 \\) has **two distinct real roots**. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Quadratic Equations:** This reminds me of when I dealt with quadratic equations in the past. I recall that the discriminant plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the roots.\n  \n- **Discriminant Concept:** I think the discriminant (\\( \\Delta \\)) determines if the roots are real and distinct, real and repeated, or complex. For two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be **positive**.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Use the Discriminant:** Set up the inequality for the discriminant to be positive.\n  2. **Graphical Interpretation:** Maybe sketch the graph to visualize where the roots lie.\n  3. **Complete the Square:** This might help in understanding the vertex form.\n  4. **Factorization:** Attempt to factor the quadratic, though this might be tricky with the given coefficients.\n\n**Reflection:** Using the discriminant seems the most straightforward since it's a well-established method for determining the nature of roots in quadratics.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Discriminant**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I remember that for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is given by \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\).\n  \n- For the equation \\( 2x^2 + mx + 8 \\), the coefficients are:\n  - \\( a = 2 \\)\n  - \\( b = m \\)\n  - \\( c = 8 \\)\n  \n- Therefore, the discriminant becomes:\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = m^2 - 4 \\times 2 \\times 8 = m^2 - 64\n  \\]\n\n**Check:** This seems correct because substituting \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) into the discriminant formula matches with what I remember.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To have **two distinct real roots**, the discriminant must be **positive**:\n  \\[\n  m^2 - 64 > 0\n  \\]\n  \n- Now, I need to solve this inequality to find the possible values of \\( m \\).\n\n**Reflection:** Solving this inequality will give the range of \\( m \\) where the quadratic has two distinct real roots. Let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Inequality**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- I can solve \\( m^2 - 64 > 0 \\) by first finding the **critical points** where the inequality equals zero:\n  \\[\n  m^2 - 64 = 0 \\\\\n  m^2 = 64 \\\\\n  m = \\pm 8\n  \\]\n  \n- These critical points divide the number line into intervals:\n  - \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\)\n  - \\( (-8, 8) \\)\n  - \\( (8, \\infty) \\)\n  \n- Now, I need to determine where the inequality \\( m^2 - 64 > 0 \\) holds.\n\n**Check:** Let's test a point in each interval.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Testing the Intervals**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Interval \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\):** Choose \\( m = -9 \\)\n  \\[\n  (-9)^2 - 64 = 81 - 64 = 17 > 0 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Interval \\( (-8, 8) \\):** Choose \\( m = 0 \\)\n  \\[\n  0^2 - 64 = 0 - 64 = -64 < 0 \\quad \\text{(False)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Interval \\( (8, \\infty) \\):** Choose \\( m = 9 \\)\n  \\[\n  9^2 - 64 = 81 - 64 = 17 > 0 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:** The inequality holds in the intervals \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\) and \\( (8, \\infty) \\). It does **not** hold in \\( (-8, 8) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Expressing the Solution in Interval Notation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The possible values of \\( m \\) where the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots are those where the inequality \\( m^2 - 64 > 0 \\) is satisfied.\n  \n- In interval notation, this is:\n  \\[\n  m \\in (-\\infty, -8) \\cup (8, \\infty)\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:** This makes sense because outside the range \\( [-8, 8] \\), the discriminant is positive, ensuring two distinct real roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Consistency Check:** The solution aligns with the properties of quadratics; only when \\( m \\) is outside \\( [-8, 8] \\) does the discriminant become positive.\n  \n- **Alternative Method:** Could I have approached this differently? For instance, graphing \\( y = m^2 - 64 \\) would show that the parabolic curve opens upwards and crosses the \\( m \\)-axis at \\( m = \\pm 8 \\). Therefore, the regions where \\( m^2 - 64 > 0 \\) are indeed \\( m < -8 \\) or \\( m > 8 \\).\n  \n- **Conclusion:** Both methods confirm the same result, reinforcing the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe possible values of \\( m \\) are:\n\\[\nm \\in (-\\infty, -8) \\cup (8, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Effectiveness:** Using the discriminant was straightforward and effective for this problem. It directly linked the condition for distinct real roots to an inequality involving \\( m \\).\n  \n- **Alternative Strategies:** Although I considered graphing and factorization, the discriminant method provided a clear path without unnecessary complexity.\n  \n- **Mistakes and Corrections:** Initially, I contemplated different methods but settled on the discriminant after confirming its applicability. There were no significant mistakes, but exploring alternative strategies helped validate the chosen approach.\n\n- **Thinking Process:** Throughout, I checked and reflected on each step, ensuring that the logic flowed correctly and that the solution made sense.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and verifying, led to the correct and concise solution.",

  "ground_truth": "By considering the expression $\\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the roots of $ax^2+bx+c$, we find that the roots are real and distinct if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is positive. So the roots of $2x^2+mx+8$ are real and distinct when $m^2-4(2)(8) > 0$.  Simplifying and factoring the left-hand side, we find $(m-8)(m+8) > 0$, which implies $m\\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,-8)\\cup (8,\\infty)}$."
