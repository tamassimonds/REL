    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll approach it as naturally as possible, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting frequently, and checking my work along the way. Let's start by fully understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe problem asks us to find the largest \\( x \\) that is **not in the domain** of \\( g(x) = f(f(x)) \\), where \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x-3} \\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Okay, this looks like a composition of functions. I'm dealing with \\( f(f(x)) \\), which means I need to apply \\( f \\) to \\( f(x) \\). Fun!\n- **Connecting to Familiar Concepts:** This reminds me of finding the domain of composite functions. I\u2019ve done something like this before, but let me brainstorm how to tackle it.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Find the Domain of \\( f(x) \\):** Identify which \\( x \\) values make \\( f(x) \\) undefined.\n  2. **Determine Where \\( f(f(x)) \\) is Undefined:** See where \\( f(x) \\) takes on values that make \\( f(f(x)) \\) undefined.\n  3. **Compose and Simplify:** Attempt to simplify \\( f(f(x)) \\) to find restrictions directly.\n  \n- **Wait a Minute:** Maybe starting with finding the domain of \\( f(x) \\) is a good idea, then seeing how it impacts \\( f(f(x)) \\).\n\nLet\u2019s go with the first strategy: **find the domain of \\( f(x) \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Domain of \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x-3} \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** For \\( f(x) \\) to be defined, the denominator cannot be zero. So, let's solve for when \\( x - 3 = 0 \\).\n  \n  \\[\n  x - 3 = 0 \\implies x = 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** This makes sense. If \\( x = 3 \\), the denominator is zero, making \\( f(3) \\) undefined. Therefore, the **domain of \\( f(x) \\)** is all real numbers except \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Domain of } f(x): \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{3\\}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** Wait, does this align with my expectations? Yes, \\( f(x) \\) is a simple rational function, and it's commonly known that such functions are undefined where their denominators equal zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing \\( f(f(x)) \\) \u2013 What Does That Mean?**\n\n- **Initial Thought:** Now, I need to apply \\( f \\) to \\( f(x) \\). So, \\( f(f(x)) \\) means replacing \\( x \\) in \\( f(x) \\) with \\( f(x) \\) itself.\n  \n  \\[\n  f(f(x)) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{x-3}\\right)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Wait, Hold On:** Before proceeding, I should ensure that \\( f(x) \\) is within the domain of \\( f \\). Remember, \\( f(x) \\) must not equal 3 because that would make the inner \\( f(f(x)) \\) undefined.\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Need to find where } f(x) \\neq 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** This adds another layer. Not only must \\( x \\) be in the domain of \\( f(x) \\), but \\( f(x) \\) itself must also be in the domain of \\( f \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding Where \\( f(x) = 3 \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** I need to find \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 3 \\). Let\u2019s set up the equation:\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{x-3} = 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving for \\( x \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  1 = 3(x - 3) \\\\\n  1 = 3x - 9 \\\\\n  3x = 10 \\\\\n  x = \\frac{10}{3}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Okay, so \\( x = \\frac{10}{3} \\) makes \\( f(x) = 3 \\). This is crucial because if \\( f(x) = 3 \\), then \\( f(f(x)) \\) is undefined.\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Therefore, } x = \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ is a point where } g(x) = f(f(x)) \\text{ is undefined.}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, \\( x = \\frac{10}{3} \\) is outside the domain of \\( f(f(x)) \\) because \\( f(x) \\) would attempt to input 3 into \\( f \\), which is undefined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Confirming \\( x = \\frac{10}{3} \\) is the Largest \\( x \\) Not in the Domain of \\( g(x) \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** I\u2019ve identified \\( x = \\frac{10}{3} \\) as a point where \\( g(x) \\) is undefined. But is it the **largest** such \\( x \\)? Let\u2019s ensure there are no larger values causing issues.\n\n- **Analyzing the Function:**\n  - \\( f(x) \\) is undefined at \\( x = 3 \\).\n  - \\( f(x) = 3 \\) at \\( x = \\frac{10}{3} \\).\n  \n- **Reflection:** Since \\( f(x) \\) is defined for all \\( x \\neq 3 \\), and the only other critical point is \\( x = \\frac{10}{3} \\), there aren\u2019t larger \\( x \\) values causing \\( f(f(x)) \\) to be undefined.\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Hence, } x = \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ is indeed the largest such } x.\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** To double-check, consider any \\( x > \\frac{10}{3} \\). For example, \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n  \\[\n  f(4) = \\frac{1}{4-3} = 1 \\quad (\\text{Defined}) \\\\\n  f(f(4)) = f(1) = \\frac{1}{1-3} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\quad (\\text{Defined})\n  \\]\n  \n  - **Realization:** Since \\( f(f(4)) \\) is defined, it confirms that \\( x = \\frac{10}{3} \\) is the boundary.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n- **Summary of Findings:**\n  - The domain of \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x-3} \\) is all real numbers except \\( x = 3 \\).\n  - \\( f(f(x)) \\) is undefined when \\( f(x) = 3 \\), which occurs at \\( x = \\frac{10}{3} \\).\n  - Therefore, \\( x = \\frac{10}{3} \\) is the largest \\( x \\) not in the domain of \\( g(x) = f(f(x)) \\).\n\n- **Final Check:** Everything aligns. There are no larger \\( x \\) values causing \\( g(x) \\) to be undefined, and all calculations lead consistently to \\( x = \\frac{10}{3} \\).\n\n- **Conclusion:** The largest \\( x \\) that is not in the domain of \\( g(x) \\) is:\n\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{\\frac{10}{3}}\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Takeaways**\n\n- **Brainstorming Helps:** Exploring different strategies initially guided me toward focusing on the domain of \\( f(x) \\) and its implications for \\( f(f(x)) \\).\n- **Reflection is Key:** Frequent checks and reflections ensured that each step logically followed the previous one, preventing errors.\n- **Understanding Composite Functions:** Recognizing the need to consider the domain of both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f(f(x)) \\) was crucial in identifying all points of undefined behavior.\n- **Final Verification Validates the Result:** Testing specific \\( x \\) values confirmed that \\( x = \\frac{10}{3} \\) indeed marks the boundary.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant reflection and checking, ensured a thorough and correct solution.",

In the first case, the denominator of $f$ is zero, so\n$$x-3=0\\Rightarrow x=3.$$For the second case, we see that the denominator of $f(f(x))$ is $\\frac{1}{x-3}-3$.  If this is zero, we have \\[\\frac{1}{x-3} = 3 \\implies x-3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies x = 3+\\frac13 = \\frac{10}3.\\]This is greater than $3$, so the largest $x$ not in the domain of $g$ is $\\boxed{\\tfrac{10}{3}}$."
