    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I would tackle it if I were working through it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each step feels correct, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's begin by understanding the question and exploring various methods to arrive at the solution.\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, my initial reaction is:\n\n- **Total Cars:** There are 30 cars in total.\n- **Color Distribution:** \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of them are red, which makes me think about how many are red overall.\n- **Door Count:** 50% are 4-door cars, so I need to calculate that too.\n- **Specifics Given:** 8 cars are 2-door and white.\n\nHonestly, this reminds me of problems involving **set intersections** or **Venn diagrams** where we deal with overlapping categories\u2014like color and number of doors. But I also think about using **proportions and basic arithmetic** to find the necessary values.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Venn Diagram Approach:** Visualizing the overlaps between red/white and 2-door/4-door might help.\n2. **System of Equations:** Setting up equations based on the given fractions and totals.\n3. **Step-by-Step Counting:** Manually counting each category and ensuring all add up correctly.\n\nAt this point, I'm leaning towards using a **Venn diagram** or a **system of equations** because they seem structured enough to handle the overlapping categories. But I\u2019ll start with the Venn diagram to see if it provides clarity.\n\n### **Step 1: Using a Venn Diagram Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's visualize the problem. We have two main categories:\n\n- **Color:** Red or White\n- **Door Count:** 2-door or 4-door\n\nSo, I can create a Venn diagram with four sections:\n\n1. **Red and 2-door**\n2. **Red and 4-door**\n3. **White and 2-door**\n4. **White and 4-door**\n\n**But Wait:**\n\nCan I fill in all these sections directly? I realize that while I know the proportions for colors and door counts, I need to be cautious about double-counting or missing specific overlaps.\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nHmm, I don't have enough direct information about individual categories. For instance, I know the total number of red cars and the total number of 4-door cars, but I don't know how they intersect without additional data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Venn diagram approach might not be straightforward because the overlaps aren't fully defined. I think I need to combine this with another method\u2014maybe a **system of equations**\u2014to make progress.\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up a System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s define variables to represent each category:\n\n- \\( R2 \\): Red and 2-door\n- \\( R4 \\): Red and 4-door\n- \\( W2 \\): White and 2-door\n- \\( W4 \\): White and 4-door\n\nGiven the total cars and the specific conditions, I can set up equations based on the provided fractions and counts.\n\n**Given:**\n\n1. Total cars: \\( R2 + R4 + W2 + W4 = 30 \\)\n2. \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) are red: \\( R2 + R4 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 = 10 \\)\n3. \\(50\\%\\) are 4-door: \\( R4 + W4 = 50\\% \\times 30 = 15 \\)\n4. 8 cars are 2-door and white: \\( W2 = 8 \\)\n\n**First Equation:**\n\n\\( R2 + R4 + W2 + W4 = 30 \\)\n\nBut I already know \\( W2 = 8 \\), so:\n\n\\( R2 + R4 + 8 + W4 = 30 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( R2 + R4 + W4 = 22 \\)  \\hspace{3cm} ***(Equation 1)***\n\n**Second Equation:**\n\nWe know \\( R2 + R4 = 10 \\)  \\hspace{3cm} ***(Equation 2)***\n\n**Third Equation:**\n\n\\( R4 + W4 = 15 \\)  \\hspace{3cm} ***(Equation 3)***\n\n**Now, I Have a System of Equations:**\n\n1. \\( R2 + R4 + W4 = 22 \\)\n2. \\( R2 + R4 = 10 \\)\n3. \\( R4 + W4 = 15 \\)\n\n**Wait, I Must Ensure:**\n\nAll cars are accounted for, and the equations must be consistent.\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nThe system seems logical, but I wonder if there's a simpler way to solve it. However, since overlapping categories can be tricky, I think solving these equations step by step will keep things organized.\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's solve Equation 2 for \\( R2 + R4 \\):\n\n\\[ R2 + R4 = 10 \\]\n\nNow, from Equation 1:\n\n\\[ R2 + R4 + W4 = 22 \\]\n\nSubtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:\n\n\\[ (R2 + R4 + W4) - (R2 + R4) = 22 - 10 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ W4 = 12 \\]\n\n**So, I Found:**\n\nThere are **12** white cars with 4 doors.\n\n**But Wait:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Let me double-check.\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nGiven that \\(50\\%\\) of the total cars are 4-door, and I've calculated \\( W4 = 12 \\), let's see if everything adds up.\n\n**Check:**\n\nTotal 4-door cars (\\( R4 + W4 = 15 \\)):\n\n\\[ R4 + 12 = 15 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ R4 = 3 \\]\n\n**Summary So Far:**\n\n- \\( R4 = 3 \\) (Red and 4-door)\n- \\( W4 = 12 \\) (White and 4-door)\n- \\( W2 = 8 \\) (White and 2-door)\n\nNow, I can find \\( R2 \\).\n\n**Using Equation 2:**\n\n\\[ R2 + R4 = 10 \\]\n\n\\[ R2 + 3 = 10 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ R2 = 7 \\]\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Totals**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt's crucial to ensure that all categories add up to the total number of cars. Let's check using the original total.\n\n**Total Cars Calculation:**\n\n\\[ R2 + R4 + W2 + W4 = 7 + 3 + 8 + 12 \\]\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[ 7 + 3 + 8 + 12 = 30 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything adds up perfectly to the total of 30 cars. This gives me confidence that the calculations are correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Answering the Original Question**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of cars that are **4-door and red**.\n\n**From My Calculations:**\n\n\\( R4 = 3 \\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere are **3** cars that are 4-door and red.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure the solution is correct, I'll quickly review the conditions and see if they align with the calculations.\n\n- **Total Cars:** 30 \u2705\n- **Red Cars:** \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 = 10\\) \u2705\n- **4-Door Cars:** \\(50\\% \\times 30 = 15\\) \u2705\n- **2-Door and White Cars:** Given as 8 \u2705\n\nAll conditions are satisfied, and the numbers align with the total.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe approach seems correct, and the final answer makes sense given the constraints. There's no contradiction, and all categories are accounted for.\n\n**Ahh Moment:**\n\nInitially, I thought a Venn diagram alone might suffice, but combining it with a system of equations provided a clearer path to the solution.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully exploring different strategies and verifying each step, the number of cars that are **4-door and red** is **3**.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the number of red 4-door cars be $x$.  Since $\\frac13$ of the cars are red, there are $\\frac13\\cdot 30 = 10$ red cars, so there are $10 -x$ red 2-door cars.  There are $(50\\%)\\cdot 30 = (0.5)(30) = 15$ cars that are 4-door cars, so $15-x$ of the 4-door cars are not red.  We then have the following Venn diagram:\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Red cars\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"4-door cars\", (80,74));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"White 2-door cars: 8\",(44,10));\nlabel(\"$x$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$10-x$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$15-x$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nAdding all four categories, we have  \\[(10-x)+x+(15-x) + 8 = 30.\\]Simplifying gives $33-x = 30$, so $x = \\boxed{3}$."
