I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check and double-check my work, and be ready to pivot if something doesn't seem right. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see that it's dealing with the **greatest common divisor (GCD)** and the **least common multiple (LCM)** of two positive integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\). The GCD is given as 8, and the LCM is 112. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Recall:** This reminds me of a property I learned: the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers equals the product of those two numbers. So, \\( \\text{GCD}(m, n) \\times \\text{LCM}(m, n) = m \\times n \\).\n  \n  \\[\n  8 \\times 112 = m \\times n\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculation:** Multiplying these together:\n  \n  \\[\n  8 \\times 112 = 896\n  \\]\n  \n  So, \\( m \\times n = 896 \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** Okay, that gives me the product of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\). But I need to find the least possible value of \\( m + n \\). How can I use this information?\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Factorization Approach:**\n   - **Idea:** Since I have the product \\( m \\times n = 896 \\), I could list the pairs of factors of 896 and check which ones have a GCD of 8 and an LCM of 112.\n\n2. **Using GCD and LCM Properties:**\n   - **Idea:** Use the relationship between GCD, LCM, and the numbers to set up equations and solve for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Algebraic Method:**\n   - **Idea:** Let\u2019s define \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) in terms of their GCD and another variable to simplify the problem.\n\n**Wait, let me check which approach might be more efficient...**\n\n- The **Factorization Approach** seems straightforward but might take time to verify each pair.\n- The **Using GCD and LCM Properties** looks promising because it directly relates to the given information.\n- The **Algebraic Method** could simplify the problem, making calculations easier.\n\n**Conclusion:** Let's start with the **Algebraic Method** to see if it simplifies things. If it gets too complicated, we can switch to the Factorization Approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Numbers Using GCD**\n\nSince the GCD of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) is 8, we can express \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) as:\n\n\\[ \nm = 8k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = 8j \n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) and \\( j \\) are integers that have no common factors other than 1 (i.e., \\( \\text{GCD}(k, j) = 1 \\)).\n\n**Reflection:** This makes sense because if 8 is the GCD, both numbers must be multiples of 8, and \\( k \\) and \\( j \\) should be coprime.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substitute into the Product Equation**\n\nWe know:\n\n\\[ \nm \\times n = 896 \n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) gives:\n\n\\[ \n(8k) \\times (8j) = 896 \n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ \n64kj = 896 \n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nDivide both sides by 64 to solve for \\( kj \\):\n\n\\[ \nkj = \\frac{896}{64} = 14 \n\\]\n\nSo, \\( k \\times j = 14 \\).\n\n**Check:** Let's verify this division:\n\n\\[ \n896 \\div 64 = 14 \n\\]\n\nMultiplying back to check:\n\n\\[ \n64 \\times 14 = 896 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, that checks out. So, \\( k \\times j = 14 \\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Find Possible Pairs \\( (k, j) \\) That Multiply to 14 and Are Copime**\n\nNow, we need to find pairs \\( (k, j) \\) such that:\n\n- \\( k \\times j = 14 \\)\n- \\( \\text{GCD}(k, j) = 1 \\)\n\n**Brainstorming Possible Pairs:**\n\n- The factors of 14 are: \\( 1 \\times 14 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 7 \\).\n- We need to check which of these pairs are coprime.\n\n**Checking Pairs:**\n\n1. **\\( (1, 14) \\):**\n   - \\( \\text{GCD}(1, 14) = 1 \\), so they are coprime.\n\n2. **\\( (2, 7) \\):**\n   - \\( \\text{GCD}(2, 7) = 1 \\), so they are coprime.\n\n**Reflection:** Both pairs satisfy the conditions. But we need the least possible value of \\( m + n \\), so we should calculate \\( m + n \\) for both pairs and see which one is smaller.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate \\( m + n \\) for Each Pair**\n\n**For \\( (k, j) = (1, 14) \\):**\n\n\\[ \nm = 8k = 8 \\times 1 = 8 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nn = 8j = 8 \\times 14 = 112 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nm + n = 8 + 112 = 120 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** That seems straightforward. Let's check the other pair to see if it's smaller.\n\n**For \\( (k, j) = (2, 7) \\):**\n\n\\[ \nm = 8k = 8 \\times 2 = 16 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nn = 8j = 8 \\times 7 = 56 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nm + n = 16 + 56 = 72 \n\\]\n\n**Check:** Wait, \\( 72 \\) is smaller than \\( 120 \\). That\u2019s interesting. So, the least possible value of \\( m + n \\) is \\( 72 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Does \\( \\text{GCD}(m, n) = 8 \\) and \\( \\text{LCM}(m, n) = 112 \\) for \\( m = 16 \\) and \\( n = 56 \\)?**\n\n- **GCD(16, 56):**\n  - The factors of 16 are: \\( 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 \\)\n  - The factors of 56 are: \\( 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56 \\)\n  - The greatest common factor is \\( 8 \\), so \\( \\text{GCD}(16, 56) = 8 \\).\n\n- **LCM(16, 56):**\n  - Let's use the formula: \n    \\[ \n    \\text{LCM}(m, n) = \\frac{m \\times n}{\\text{GCD}(m, n)} \n    \\]\n    \\[ \n    \\text{LCM}(16, 56) = \\frac{16 \\times 56}{8} = \\frac{896}{8} = 112 \n    \\]\n    \n**Reflection:** Both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, **\\( m = 16 \\)** and **\\( n = 56 \\)** are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe least possible value of \\( m + n \\) is **72**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Was the initial approach correct?** Starting with the Algebraic Method helped simplify the problem by expressing \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) in terms of their GCD and another variable.\n  \n- **Did checking along the way help?** Yes, verifying each step ensured that \\( k \\times j = 14 \\) was correct and that both pairs \\( (k, j) \\) satisfied the coprime condition.\n\n- **Is the final answer reasonable?** Given that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) must be multiples of 8 and their product is 896, ending up with \\( m = 16 \\) and \\( n = 56 \\) makes sense. Adding these gives the smallest sum possible under the given conditions.\n\n- **Reflection on the process:** It was essential to explore different strategies initially to find the most efficient path. Checking each calculation ensured accuracy, and being open to adjusting the approach led to the correct solution.\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through each step, reflecting frequently, and verifying calculations, we arrived at the least possible value of \\( m + n \\) being **72**.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the GCD of $m$ and $n$ is 8, $m = 8x$ and $n = 8y$ for some integers $x$ and $y$.  Note that minimizing $m + n = 8x + 8y = 8(x + y)$ is equivalent to minimizing $x + y$.\n\nThe LCM of $m$ and $n$ is $112 = 2^4 \\cdot 7 = 8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7$, so one of $x$ and $y$ is divisible by 2 and one is divisible by 7.  Then we can minimize $x + y$ by setting $x$ and $y$ to be 2 and 7 in some order.  Therefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is $8(2 + 7) = \\boxed{72}$."
