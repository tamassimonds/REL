I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking if I'm on the right track, and making adjustments as needed\u2014just like a human would naturally approach a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the problem deals with two sums \\( G \\) and \\( G' \\) defined as the sums of infinite geometric series. We've got:\n\n- \\( G \\): Sum of an infinite geometric series with the first term \\( x \\) and common ratio \\( y \\).\n- \\( G' \\): Sum of another infinite geometric series with the first term \\( y \\) and common ratio \\( x \\).\n\nThe condition given is \\( G = G' \\), and we need to find \\( x + y \\) within the bounds \\( -1 < x < y < 1 \\).\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of properties of geometric series and maybe equations involving \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). The fact that \\( G = G' \\) suggests some relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that we need to uncover.\n\nI also notice the constraints \\( -1 < x < y < 1 \\), which are important because they ensure the series converge. This makes me think about how the convergence criteria relate to the equality of \\( G \\) and \\( G' \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Review the Formula for the Sum of a Geometric Series:**\n   - I remember that the sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series with first term \\( a \\) and common ratio \\( r \\) is given by \\( S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} \\) when \\( |r| < 1 \\).\n\n2. **Set Up Equations Based on \\( G = G' \\):**\n   - Since \\( G = G' \\), I can write the equation based on the sums' formulas and see if I can solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Consider Constraints \\( -1 < x < y < 1 \\):**\n   - Use these bounds to ensure that the solution makes sense and check if they imply any additional relationships between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n4. **Substitution or Elimination Methods:**\n   - Maybe treat the equation as a system and apply substitution or elimination to find \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n5. **Check for Symmetry or Simplification:**\n   - Look for symmetrical relationships or simplifications that can make the problem easier.\n\nLet's start with the first two strategies: applying the geometric series sum formula and setting up the equation \\( G = G' \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Sum Formula to \\( G \\) and \\( G' \\)**\n\nOkay, let me write down the formulas for \\( G \\) and \\( G' \\) using the infinite geometric series sum formula.\n\n**For \\( G \\):**\n\n\\[\nG = \\frac{x}{1 - y} \\quad \\text{(since the first term is \\( x \\) and common ratio is \\( y \\))}\n\\]\n\n**For \\( G' \\):**\n\n\\[\nG' = \\frac{y}{1 - x} \\quad \\text{(since the first term is \\( y \\) and common ratio is \\( x \\))}\n\\]\n\nHmm, these look straightforward. Now, given \\( G = G' \\), I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{1 - y} = \\frac{y}{1 - x}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Cross-Multiplying to Eliminate the Fractions**\n\nTo solve this equation, let's cross-multiply to get rid of the denominators:\n\n\\[\nx(1 - x) = y(1 - y)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n\\[\nx - x^2 = y - y^2\n\\]\n\nWait, this looks like a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Let's rearrange it to see the relationship better.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Rearranging the Equation**\n\nLet me move all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\nx - x^2 - y + y^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nReorganizing:\n\n\\[\n-x^2 + y^2 + x - y = 0\n\\]\n\nThis looks like a difference of squares plus linear terms. Maybe I can factor or rearrange it further. But before that, let's see if there's another insight.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection: Checking the Structure**\n\nWait a second\u2014there's a similarity to the difference of squares here:\n\n\\[\ny^2 - x^2 = y - x\n\\]\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor it like this:\n\n\\[\n(y + x)(y - x) = y - x\n\\]\n\nBut before diving into factoring, let's check if this holds or if it's leading me astray.\n\nIf I divide both sides by \\( y - x \\) (but only if \\( y \\neq x \\), which it shouldn't since \\( x < y \\)), I get:\n\n\\[\ny + x = 1\n\\]\n\nThis is interesting! It suggests that \\( x + y = 1 \\). But let\u2019s verify if this aligns with our original equation and if it satisfies the given constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\nSo, if \\( x + y = 1 \\), let's see if it satisfies the equation \\( G = G' \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( y = 1 - x \\) into the original equation \\( G = G' \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{1 - (1 - x)} = \\frac{1 - x}{1 - x}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{x} = 1 \\quad \\text{(assuming \\( x \\neq 0 \\))}\n\\]\n\nThis holds true, so \\( x + y = 1 \\) is indeed a solution.\n\nBut wait\u2014let's check if this satisfies the constraints \\( -1 < x < y < 1 \\).\n\nIf \\( x + y = 1 \\), and \\( x < y \\), then:\n\n\\[\nx < \\frac{1}{2} < y\n\\]\n\nThis fits within the bounds \\( -1 < x < y < 1 \\), so it's valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection: Confirming the Approach**\n\nThe solution \\( x + y = 1 \\) aligns with both the equation \\( G = G' \\) and the given constraints. Initially, it seemed too straightforward, so I double-checked by substituting back into the original equality and verifying the bounds.\n\nI considered alternative methods, like attempting to factor the quadratic equation differently or looking for symmetrical properties, but they led back to the same conclusion. Setting \\( x + y = 1 \\) directly satisfied the condition \\( G = G' \\) without any contradictions.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the solution, the value of \\( x + y \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach ensured that each part of the problem was thoroughly examined, reflecting on the correctness at each stage and adjusting the strategy as needed\u2014much like a human would naturally work through a challenging problem.",
