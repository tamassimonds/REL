It's essential to think it out like a human would\u2014messy, with doubts and reflections\u2014to truly understand and solve the problem.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I think, \"Okay, we're dealing with multiples of 6, and we need to find those where the square is less than 200. This seems like a number theory problem combined with some basic algebra.\"\n\nInitial brainstorming:\n- **Multiples of 6:** These are numbers like ...,-12, -6, 0, 6, 12, 18, 24,...\n  \n- **Square of \\(x\\) less than 200:** So, \\(x^2 < 200\\). This implies that \\(x\\) must be between the square roots of 200.\n\n- **Possible Values of \\(x\\):** I need to find all multiples of 6 within this range.\n\nAt this point, I'm thinking about how to efficiently find all such \\(x\\). Do I list them all? Or is there a more systematic approach?\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Listing Multiples of 6:**\n   - Start from the smallest multiple of 6 and list them until the square exceeds 200.\n\n2. **Using Inequalities:**\n   - Set up an inequality based on the square root of 200 to find the range of \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Combining Both:**\n   - Use the square root to limit the range and then list the multiples of 6 within that range.\n\nI'm leaning towards combining both strategies: use the square root to establish the boundaries and then list the multiples of 6 within those boundaries. This seems efficient and systematic.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Boundaries Using Square Roots**\n\nLet me start by finding the square root of 200 to determine the range for \\(x\\).\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{200} = \\sqrt{100 \\times 2} = 10\\sqrt{2} \\approx 14.14\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, \\(x\\) must be between -14.14 and 14.14 because \\(x\\) can be negative, too.\n- This gives me a clear range to work with.\n\n### **Step 2: List Multiples of 6 Within the Range**\n\nNow, I'll list all multiples of 6 within this range:\n\n- **Negative Multiples:** -12, -6, 0\n- **Positive Multiples:** 6, 12\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Wait a moment... Do I have all the multiples within -14.14 and 14.14?\n- Yes, checking:  \n  - **From -12:** \\(6 \\times -2 = -12\\)  \n  - **From -6:** \\(6 \\times -1 = -6\\)  \n  - **Zero:** \\(6 \\times 0 = 0\\)  \n  - **From 6:** \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\)  \n  - **From 12:** \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\)  \n- Multiples beyond 12 (like 18) exceed 14.14.\n\n**Correction:**\n- Initially, I almost listed 18, but it exceeds 14.14, so it doesn't count.\n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Squared Values Are Less Than 200**\n\nLet me check if the squares of these multiples are indeed less than 200:\n\n- \\( (-12)^2 = 144 < 200 \\)\n- \\( (-6)^2 = 36 < 200 \\)\n- \\( 0^2 = 0 < 200 \\)\n- \\( 6^2 = 36 < 200 \\)\n- \\( 12^2 = 144 < 200 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- All these squared values are less than 200, so they are valid.\n\n### **Step 4: Count the Possible Values of \\(x\\)**\n\nNow, let's count how many multiples of 6 are within the range:\n\n- Negative: -12, -6\n- Zero: 0\n- Positive: 6, 12\n\n**Total Count:**\n- Negative: 2\n- Zero: 1\n- Positive: 2\n- **Total: 5**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check to ensure I'm not missing any multiples.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using Inequalities**\n\nJust to confirm, let's use an inequality to find possible values of \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 < 200 \\implies -\\sqrt{200} < x < \\sqrt{200} \\implies -14.14 < x < 14.14\n\\]\n\n**Finding Multiples of 6:**\n- The largest multiple of 6 within \u00b114.14 is \u00b112.\n\n**Listing Them Again:** \n- As before: -12, -6, 0, 6, 12\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both methods agree, so I'm confident in the solution.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure everything makes sense:\n\n- **Range:** \\( -14.14 < x < 14.14 \\)\n- **Multiples of 6 Listed:** -12, -6, 0, 6, 12\n- **Squares Checked:** All are less than 200\n- **Total Possible Values:** 5\n\n**Wait, is there anything I missed?**\n\n- **Negative Multiples:** Only -12 and -6 are valid.\n- **Zero:** Included.\n- **Positive Multiples:** 6 and 12 are valid.\n- **Multiples Beyond 12:** Exceed 14.14, so excluded.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Everything checks out. The total number of possible values of \\(x\\) is **5**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying my calculations, the total number of possible values of \\(x\\) is **5**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** \n   - Need multiples of 6 whose squares are less than 200.\n   \n2. **Brainstorming Strategies:** \n   - List multiples within the square root boundaries.\n   - Use inequalities to define the range.\n\n3. **Calculating Boundaries:** \n   - \\(\\sqrt{200} \\approx 14.14\\)\n   \n4. **Listing Multiples of 6:**\n   - Negative: -12, -6\n   - Zero: 0\n   - Positive: 6, 12\n   \n5. **Verifying Squared Values:**\n   - All listed multiples' squares are < 200.\n\n6. **Counting Possible Values:**\n   - Total: 5 (including zero)\n\n7. **Alternative Approach for Confirmation:**\n   - Reapplying the inequality confirms the same multiples.\n\n8. **Final Check:** \n   - Ensured no multiples outside the range are considered.\n\n9. **Conclusion:** \n   - Total possible values of \\(x\\) is 5.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Initially, I thought of listing multiples directly, which worked well.\n- Checking squared values ensured correctness.\n- Using inequalities provided a secondary confirmation.\n- Always checking and reflecting helped catch and correct minor oversights.\n\nThis step-by-step human-like approach\u2014brainstorming, exploring, reflecting, and verifying\u2014ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",
