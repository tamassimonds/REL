    "final_solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, reflecting and checking along the way to ensure we're on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nWe\u2019re given two quasars, A and B, with their respective bolometric fluxes and redshifts:\n\n- **Quasar A:**  \n  - Bolometric Flux: \\(10^{-25} \\, \\text{W/m}^2\\)  \n  - Redshift: \\(z = 0.06\\)\n\n- **Quasar B:**  \n  - Bolometric Flux: \\(10^{-24} \\, \\text{W/m}^2\\)  \n  - Redshift: \\(z = 0.02\\)\n\nOur goal is to find the ratio of the masses of their central black holes, \\(M_A / M_B\\), assuming Eddington-limited accretion.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**  \n1. **Eddington Luminosity Relation:**  \n   I remember that for black holes accreting at the Eddington limit, there's a direct relationship between the luminosity and the mass of the black hole. Maybe we can use this to relate flux and mass.\n\n2. **Flux-Luminosity Relationship:**  \n   Flux and luminosity are related by distance. Since we're given redshifts, perhaps we can link redshift to distance and then to luminosity.\n\n3. **Comparing Fluxes Directly:**  \n   Can we compare the fluxes directly to infer something about the masses? But wait, flux depends on distance, so redshift differences will affect this.\n\n**Initial Approach:**  \nI'll start by exploring the Eddington luminosity relation since it directly links mass and luminosity, and we can tie in bolometric flux through luminosity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Eddington Luminosity and Mass Relationship**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe Eddington luminosity (\\(L_{\\text{Edd}}\\)) is the maximum luminosity a black hole can have when radiation pressure balances gravitational pull. It's directly proportional to the mass of the black hole:\n\n\\[\nL_{\\text{Edd}} = 1.26 \\times 10^{31} \\left(\\frac{M}{M_\\odot}\\right) \\, \\text{W}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(M\\) is the mass of the black hole and \\(M_\\odot\\) is the solar mass.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, if both quasars are accreting at the Eddington limit, their luminosities are proportional to their masses. But we need to relate luminosity to the observed flux to make comparisons.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Relating Luminosity to Flux**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFlux (\\(F\\)) is the luminosity (\\(L\\)) spread over the surface area of a sphere with radius equal to the distance to the source (\\(d\\)):\n\n\\[\nF = \\frac{L}{4\\pi d^2}\n\\]\n\nGiven redshift (\\(z\\)), we can determine the luminosity distance, which accounts for the expansion of the universe.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy relating \\(F\\) to \\(L\\) and knowing \\(L \\propto M\\), we can find a relation between flux and mass, factoring in the distance which is affected by redshift.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Luminosity Distance from Redshift**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo proceed, we need to convert redshift into luminosity distance. For small redshifts (\\(z < 0.1\\)), the luminosity distance (\\(d_L\\)) can be approximated as:\n\n\\[\nd_L \\approx \\frac{c \\cdot z}{H_0}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light (\\(3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\))\n- \\(H_0\\) is the Hubble constant (\\(70 \\, \\text{km/s/Mpc}\\) or \\(7 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m/s/Mpc}\\))\n\n**Calculation for Quasar A:**\n\n\\[\nd_{L,A} \\approx \\frac{3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.06}{70 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{m/s/Mpc}} = \\frac{18 \\times 10^6}{70 \\times 10^3} \\, \\text{Mpc} = \\frac{18}{70} \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{Mpc} \\approx 257 \\, \\text{Mpc}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation for Quasar B:**\n\n\\[\nd_{L,B} \\approx \\frac{3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 0.02}{70 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{m/s/Mpc}} = \\frac{6 \\times 10^6}{70 \\times 10^3} \\, \\text{Mpc} = \\frac{6}{70} \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{Mpc} \\approx 86 \\, \\text{Mpc}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThese distances seem reasonable for the given redshifts. Now we can relate the fluxes to luminosities using these distances.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Expressing Mass in Terms of Observed Flux**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince \\(F = \\frac{L}{4\\pi d^2}\\) and \\(L = L_{\\text{Edd}} \\propto M\\), we can express mass in terms of observed flux and distance:\n\n\\[\nM \\propto \\frac{F \\cdot d^2}{4\\pi}\n\\]\n\nBut since \\(4\\pi\\) is a constant, we can ignore it for the ratio:\n\n\\[\nM \\propto F \\cdot d^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the ratio of masses is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{M_A}{M_B} = \\frac{F_A \\cdot d_{L,A}^2}{F_B \\cdot d_{L,B}^2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems like a straightforward way to relate the masses using the fluxes and distances. Let's plug in the numbers to see if it works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Mass Ratio**\n\n**Given Fluxes:**\n\n- \\(F_A = 10^{-25} \\, \\text{W/m}^2\\)  \n- \\(F_B = 10^{-24} \\, \\text{W/m}^2\\)  \n\n**Calculated Distances:**\n\n- \\(d_{L,A} \\approx 257 \\, \\text{Mpc}\\)  \n- \\(d_{L,B} \\approx 86 \\, \\text{Mpc}\\)  \n\n**Calculating \\(d^2\\):**\n\n- \\(d_{L,A}^2 = (257)^2 \\approx 66049 \\, \\text{Mpc}^2\\)  \n- \\(d_{L,B}^2 = (86)^2 \\approx 7396 \\, \\text{Mpc}^2\\)  \n\n**Plugging into the Mass Ratio Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{M_A}{M_B} = \\frac{10^{-25} \\times 66049}{10^{-24} \\times 7396} = \\frac{66049 \\times 10^{-25}}{7396 \\times 10^{-24}}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{M_A}{M_B} = \\frac{66049}{7396} \\times 10^{-1} = 8.93 \\times 10^{-1} \\approx 0.9\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, the calculated ratio \\(\\approx 0.9\\), which matches Option (A). But let's double-check to ensure that's correct, especially since the ratio is close to 1, and slight calculation errors could affect the outcome.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing the answer, it's crucial to verify that all assumptions and calculations are correct. Let's review each step to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Eddington Luminosity and Mass Relationship:**  \n   - Correctly identified that \\(L_{\\text{Edd}} \\propto M\\).\n\n2. **Flux-Luminosity Relationship:**  \n   - Correctly related flux to luminosity using \\(F = \\frac{L}{4\\pi d^2}\\).\n\n3. **Luminosity Distance Calculation:**  \n   - Used \\(d_L \\approx \\frac{c \\cdot z}{H_0}\\) for small redshifts.\n   - Calculated \\(d_{L,A} \\approx 257 \\, \\text{Mpc}\\) and \\(d_{L,B} \\approx 86 \\, \\text{Mpc}\\), which seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Mass Ratio Formula Derivation:**  \n   - Derived \\(\\frac{M_A}{M_B} = \\frac{F_A \\cdot d_{L,A}^2}{F_B \\cdot d_{L,B}^2}\\), which is logical.\n\n5. **Numerical Calculation:**  \n   - Calculated \\(d_{L,A}^2 \\approx 66049\\) and \\(d_{L_B}^2 \\approx 7396\\).\n   - Computed the ratio as \\(\\frac{66049 \\times 10^{-25}}{7396 \\times 10^{-24}} = 8.93 \\times 10^{-1} \\approx 0.9\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll steps check out. The initial approach using the Eddington luminosity relation and flux-to-luminosity conversion led directly to the mass ratio. The calculations are consistent and align with Option (A).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.9}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically applying the relationship between Eddington luminosity and black hole mass, along with the flux-luminosity-distance formula, we determined that the ratio of the masses of the central black holes in Quasars A and B is approximately 0.9. This approach ensured accuracy by verifying each step and reflecting on the logic behind the calculations.",
