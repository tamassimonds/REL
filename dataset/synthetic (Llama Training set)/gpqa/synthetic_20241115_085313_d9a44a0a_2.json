  "problem": "Question: A scientist wants to test the effect of a mutation M in a gene X in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. He places a copy of the original gene X on a plasmid with a marker Y.

  "ground_truth": "Lethal, URA3, LEU2, 5'-FOA\n\nThis is a classic method used in yeast genetics. To test the mutation to be introduced, one can directly add the mutation in a gene. But if the mutation is lethal, one cannot obtain the mutants in the experiment as they cannot survive.So, if one doubts a residue to be functionally important, a wild type copy can be placed on a plasmid (with URA3 as the auxotrophic marker) and then the mutation can be introduced in the genome using a second marker (LEU2) which can be used for selecting the mutants. To assess the actual effect of the mutation, the plasmid can be removed if grown in the presence of 5'-FOA that selects against URA3. If the strain fails to grow on the absence of the wild type copy of the gene, it confirms that the mutated version can't support growth and the mutation is lethal."
