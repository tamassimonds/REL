    "working_out": "### Step 1: **Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. The question is about a finite potential well with three regions:\n\n1. **Region I (0 < x < a):** Potential \\( V = 0 \\)\n2. **Region II (x < 0):** Potential \\( V \\)\n3. **Region III (x > a):** Potential \\( V \\)\n\nA particle with energy \\( E < V \\) is trapped in this well. We need to determine the probable current density \\( J \\) in regions II and III, using the provided formula for \\( J \\):\n\n\\[\nJ = \\frac{\\hbar}{2mi} (\\Psi \\nabla \\Psi^* - \\Psi^* \\nabla \\Psi)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\Psi \\) is the wave function in the region of interest.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Finite Potential Well:** This reminds me of problems involving quantum tunneling and bound states in potential wells I've encountered before.\n- **Current Density \\( J \\):** I recall that in quantum mechanics, the current density relates to the flow of probability. It's linked to the wave function and its gradient.\n- **Energy \\( E < V \\):** The particle is classically forbidden in regions II and III, which suggests that the wave function may be evanescent (exponentially decaying).\n- **Goal:** Find \\( J \\) in regions II and III. Since the potential outside the well is constant, I expect \\( J \\) to be related to the behavior of \\( \\Psi \\) in those regions.\n\nAt this point, I'm not entirely sure how to approach it. But brainstorming strategies:\n\n1. **Examine the Wave Function \\( \\Psi \\):** Determine its form in regions II and III.\n2. **Apply the Current Density Formula:** Once \\( \\Psi \\) is known, plug it into the current density formula.\n3. **Check Boundary Conditions:** Ensure continuity of \\( \\Psi \\) and its derivative at the boundaries \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = a \\).\n\nDoes that make sense? Let's see if I can proceed with this plan. If it doesn't work, I might have to think of another way.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Examining the Wave Function \\( \\Psi \\) in Regions II and III**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since \\( E < V \\), the particle is in a classically forbidden region. Typically, in quantum mechanics, the wave function \\( \\Psi \\) in such regions decays exponentially.\n- I remember from quantum mechanics that the general solution for the wave function in a region where the potential is constant and higher than the particle's energy involves exponential terms.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Time-Independent Schr\u00f6dinger Equation (TISE):** \n   - For \\( \\Psi \\) in regions II and III, apply TISE to find the form of \\( \\Psi \\).\n   \n2. **Assume an Exponential Decay Solution:** \n   - Given \\( E < V \\), an exponentially decaying solution seems appropriate.\n\n**Trying Strategy 1: Applying the TISE**\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2 \\Psi}{dx^2} + V \\Psi = E \\Psi\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 \\Psi}{dx^2} = k^2 \\Psi\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k^2 = \\frac{2m(V - E)}{\\hbar^2} \\). Since \\( E < V \\), \\( k^2 > 0 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, this leads to a solution involving hyperbolic functions:\n\n\\[\n\\Psi = A e^{\\pm kx}\n\\]\n\nBut that doesn't seem right for regions II and III because \\( \\Psi \\) should decay as \\( |x| \\to \\infty \\). Exponential growth (\\( e^{kx} \\)) would blow up at infinity.\n\n**Hmm, maybe I should have assumed a different form. Let me try assuming decay in both regions.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Revising the Wave Function \\( \\Psi \\) in Regions II and III**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To ensure the wave function decays as \\( |x| \\to \\infty \\), I should only consider the decaying exponentials.\n- Therefore, the correct form should be:\n\n   - **Region II (x < 0):** \\( \\Psi_{\\text{II}} = A e^{-kx} \\)\n   - **Region III (x > a):** \\( \\Psi_{\\text{III}} = B e^{-kx} \\)\n\n   where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constants to be determined by boundary conditions.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Apply Boundary Conditions at x = 0 and x = a:** \n   - Ensure continuity of \\( \\Psi \\) and its derivative at the boundaries.\n   \n2. **Determine Constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):** \n   - Use the fact that there are no incoming waves in regions II and III, implying certain conditions on \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n**Checking Approach:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because we want the wave function to represent an evanescent wave, decaying exponentially outside the well. Let's proceed with this.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Applying Boundary Conditions to Determine Constants**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **At x = 0 (Boundary between I and II):**\n   - **Continuity of \\( \\Psi \\):** \\( \\Psi_{\\text{I}}(0) = \\Psi_{\\text{II}}(0) \\)\n   - **Continuity of \\( \\frac{d\\Psi}{dx} \\):** \\( \\left. \\frac{d\\Psi_{\\text{I}}}{dx} \\right|_{x=0} = \\left. \\frac{d\\Psi_{\\text{II}}}{dx} \\right|_{x=0} \\)\n\n- **At x = a (Boundary between I and III):**\n   - **Continuity of \\( \\Psi \\):** \\( \\Psi_{\\text{I}}(a) = \\Psi_{\\text{III}}(a) \\)\n   - **Continuity of \\( \\frac{d\\Psi}{dx} \\):** \\( \\left. \\frac{d\\Psi_{\\text{I}}}{dx} \\right|_{x=a} = \\left. \\frac{d\\Psi_{\\text{III}}}{dx} \\right|_{x=a} \\)\n\n**Given:**\n\n- **Region I:** \\( \\Psi_{\\text{I}}(x) = C \\sin(k_{\\text{I}} x) \\) (assuming a bound state solution)\n- **Wave Numbers:**\n   - \\( k_{\\text{I}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar} \\)\n   - \\( k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m(V - E)}}{\\hbar} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, I'm not sure about the form of \\( \\Psi_{\\text{I}}(x) \\). But if I remember correctly, for bound states in a finite well, the wave function is sinusoidal inside the well (region I).\n\nLet me check if \\( \\Psi_{\\text{I}}(x) = C \\sin(k_{\\text{I}} x) \\) makes sense. Would it satisfy the boundary conditions? \n\n**Hmm, I think I need to adjust the wave function to match the physical situation.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Correcting the Wave Function in Region I**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For a finite potential well, the wave function inside the well (region I) is typically:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Psi_{\\text{I}}(x) = C \\cos(k_{\\text{I}} x) \\text{ or } \\Psi_{\\text{I}}(x) = C \\sin(k_{\\text{I}} x)\n   \\]\n\n- However, at the boundaries \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = a \\), the wave function must be continuous.\n\n- If we choose \\( \\Psi_{\\text{I}}(x) = C \\cos(k_{\\text{I}} x) \\), then at \\( x = 0 \\), \\( \\Psi_{\\text{I}}(0) = C \\).\n\n- **Boundary Condition at x = 0:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\Psi_{\\text{II}}(0) = A = C\n   \\]\n\n- **Boundary Condition at x = a:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\Psi_{\\text{I}}(a) = C \\cos(k_{\\text{I}} a) = B e^{-ka}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left. \\frac{d\\Psi_{\\text{I}}}{dx} \\right|_{x=a} = -C k_{\\text{I}} \\sin(k_{\\text{I}} a) = -\\left. \\frac{d\\Psi_{\\text{III}}}{dx} \\right|_{x=a} = k B e^{-ka}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\nSolving these equations will give me the constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). But I notice that the continuity of the derivative at \\( x = a \\) provides a relation between \\( k_{\\text{I}} \\) and \\( k \\). This might be useful to relate the wave numbers.\n\nLet me proceed with these equations.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Solving for Constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- From the boundary condition at \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   A = C\n   \\]\n\n- From the boundary condition at \\( x = a \\):\n\n   \\[\n   C \\cos(k_{\\text{I}} a) = B e^{-ka}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   -C k_{\\text{I}} \\sin(k_{\\text{I}} a) = -k B e^{-ka} \\Rightarrow B = \\frac{C k_{\\text{I}} \\sin(k_{\\text{I}} a)}{k}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis gives me \\( B \\) in terms of \\( C \\) and the wave numbers. I can substitute this into the current density formula to see if it simplifies.\n\nBut first, I should check if \\( k_{\\text{I}} = k \\). Let's see:\n\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{2m(V - E)}{\\hbar^2}\n\\]\n   \n\\[\nk_{\\text{I}}^2 = \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}\n\\]\n   \n\\[\nk_{\\text{I}}^2 = k^2 \\frac{E}{V - E}\n\\]\n\nWait, does that make sense? This implies:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k_{\\text{I}}^2}{k^2} = \\frac{E}{V - E}\n\\]\n\n**Hmm, thinking this through...**\n\n- Since \\( V > E \\), \\( \\frac{E}{V - E} < 1 \\).\n- Therefore, \\( k_{\\text{I}} < k \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis suggests that the wave number inside the well \\( k_{\\text{I}} \\) is less than the wave number outside \\( k \\). This aligns with physical intuition because the wave function should oscillate more slowly inside the well compared to the exponentially decaying wave outside.\n\nThis makes me more confident that the boundary conditions are being applied correctly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Applying the Current Density Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have the wave function \\( \\Psi \\) in regions II and III, I can calculate the current density \\( J \\).\n- Recall that the current density depends on \\( \\Psi \\) and its gradient \\( \\nabla \\Psi \\).\n\n**For Region II (x < 0):**\n\n\\[\n\\Psi_{\\text{II}}(x) = A e^{-kx} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\nabla \\Psi_{\\text{II}} = -k A e^{-kx}\n\\]\n\n**For Region III (x > a):**\n\n\\[\n\\Psi_{\\text{III}}(x) = B e^{-kx} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\nabla \\Psi_{\\text{III}} = -k B e^{-kx}\n\\]\n\n**Now, substituting into the current density formula \\( J \\):**\n\n\\[\nJ = \\frac{\\hbar}{2mi} (\\Psi \\nabla \\Psi^* - \\Psi^* \\nabla \\Psi)\n\\]\n   \n**For Region II:**\n\n\\[\nJ_{\\text{II}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2mi} (A e^{-kx} (-kA^* e^{kx}) - A^* e^{kx} (-kA e^{-kx}))\n\\]\n   \n\\[\n= \\frac{\\hbar}{2mi} (-k |A|^2 e^{-2kx} + k |A|^2 e^{-2kx}) = 0\n\\]\n\n**For Region III:**\n\n\\[\nJ_{\\text{III}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2mi} (B e^{-kx} (-kB^* e^{kx}) - B^* e^{kx} (-kB e^{-kx}))\n\\]\n   \n\\[\n= \\frac{\\hbar}{2mi} (-k |B|^2 e^{-2kx} + k |B|^2 e^{-2kx}) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, the current density \\( J \\) in both regions II and III is **zero**. This doesn't seem right at first because I was expecting a non-zero current density due to the wave function decay.\n\n**Hmm, let me think about it.**\n\n- **Interpretation:** The zero current density implies there is no probability flow in these regions. This makes sense because the wave function is stationary, and in classically forbidden regions where \\( E < V \\), the wave function is purely decaying with no incoming or outgoing waves.\n  \n- **Boundary Conditions:** The continuity conditions ensure that the wave function and its derivative match at the boundaries. Since the wave functions in regions II and III are purely decaying exponentials, the contributions to the current density cancel out.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe zero current density **is correct**. It signifies that there is no probability current in regions II and III, consistent with the classically forbidden nature of these regions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** By applying boundary conditions and correctly assuming the form of the wave function, I've determined that the current density \\( J \\) is zero in both regions II and III.\n- **Consistency with Quantum Mechanics:** This aligns with the physical interpretation that in classically forbidden regions, there is no net probability flow; the wave function is stationary and evanescent.\n- **Reflection:** Initially, I expected a non-zero current density, but reconsidering the role of the wave function in these regions clarified that the current density indeed should be zero.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nAt first, I was misled into thinking there might be a non-zero current density. However, by carefully applying boundary conditions and reflecting on the physical meaning of the wave function in classically forbidden regions, I corrected my approach. This process of brainstorming, checking, and reflecting ensured the solution is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n**(A) Zero**\n\nThe probable current density \\( J \\) in the regions II and III is **zero**.",
