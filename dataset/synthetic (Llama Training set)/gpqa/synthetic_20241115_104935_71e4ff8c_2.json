    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I'm solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to see if I'm on the right path, and adjust my approach if something doesn't seem correct. Let's dive in!\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question, I see two key pieces of information:\n\n1. **Parallax Measurement:** The parallax of the star is measured to be **2 milliarcseconds**.\n2. **New Distance:** We're asked to find the change in brightness if the star is placed at a distance of **20 parsecs**.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- Parallax is an angle\u2014perhaps it's related to distance?\n- Brightness (or flux) changes with distance\u2014I've encountered the inverse square law before.\n- I remember that parallax and distance are connected; maybe I need to convert parallax to distance first.\n  \nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. It feels like a mix of angular measurements and the inverse square law for brightness. Let me explore these ideas further.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Convert Parallax to Distance:**\n   - Use the parallax angle to find the distance in parsecs.\n\n2. **Apply the Inverse Square Law:**\n   - Use the calculated distance to see how brightness changes compared to the original distance.\n\n**Reflection:**\nConverting parallax to distance seems like a logical first step since the problem provides a parallax measurement. Once I have the distance, I can relate it to brightness changes using the inverse square law.\n\n### **Step 1: Convert Parallax to Distance**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I recall that the parallax angle in arcseconds relates to distance in parsecs by the formula:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance (parsecs)} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Parallax (arcseconds)}}\n  \\]\n- Given the parallax is **2 milliarcseconds**, I need to convert this to arcseconds first.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n2 \\text{ milliarcseconds} = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ arcseconds}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^{-3}} = 500 \\text{ parsecs}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Wait, that number seems really big. Let me think\u2014500 parsecs for a parallax of 2 milliarcseconds makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems correct. The inverse relationship fits\u2014smaller parallax angle means a larger distance.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Brightness Change Using Inverse Square Law**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Brightness (or flux) is related to distance by the inverse square law:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Brightness} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\text{Distance}^2}\n  \\]\n- Since we want to find the factor by which brightness changes, we can set up a ratio of the squares of the distances.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Let\u2019s denote:\n  - \\(\\text{Original Distance} = 500 \\text{ parsecs}\\)\n  - \\(\\text{New Distance} = 20 \\text{ parsecs}\\)\n  \n- The brightness factor (\\(F\\)) is:\n  \\[\n  F = \\left(\\frac{500}{20}\\right)^2 = \\left(25\\right)^2 = 625\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Hmm, this factor is **625**, but none of the options provided are exactly **620** or **410**, which are close. Let me think if I've made any rounding or conversion mistakes.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Maybe the options are approximations. The calculation seems logically correct, but the exact answer isn't matching the options exactly. \n\n### **Step 3: Adjust for Approximation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since our calculated factor is **625**, and the closest option is **620**, it might be a matter of rounding or slight approximation in the parallax conversion.\n\n- Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the calculation to be slightly less precise, which would align with choosing **620** over **625**.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- To align with the options, we could consider that slight differences in rounding or significant figures might be acceptable.\n  \n- Given that, **620** is the closest reasonable option.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The approach seems correct, but the minor difference could be due to rounding conventions in the options provided.\n  \n### **Final Step: Select the Closest Option**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Based on the calculations and taking into account possible rounding, the best option that matches our result is **620**.\n\n- Since the other options (**410**, **530**, **170**) are farther from our calculated factor, **620** makes the most sense.\n\n**Decision:**\n- **Option (A) ~620** is the factor by which the brightness of the star changes when placed at a distance of 20 parsecs.\n\n### **Final Reflection and Check**\n\n- **Quick Check:** The calculation of \\((25)^2 = 625\\) seems correct. The logic behind using the inverse square law is sound.\n\n- **Closer Examination:** The slight difference between **625** and the offered **620** could be attributed to rounding or approximation typically expected in multiple-choice scenarios.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Given the steps followed and the reasoning applied, **Option (A) ~620** is the most appropriate choice.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Converted Parallax to Distance:** From 2 milliarcseconds to **500 parsecs**.\n- **Calculated Brightness Change:** Using the inverse square law, brightness increases by a factor of **625**.\n- **Adjusted for Approximation:** Rounded to **620** to match the closest option provided.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, exploring different strategies, and reflecting on each step, led me to confidently select **Option (A) ~620** as the factor by which the brightness of the star changes when placed at a distance of 20 parsecs.",
