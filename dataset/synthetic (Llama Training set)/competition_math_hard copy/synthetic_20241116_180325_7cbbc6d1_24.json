    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, exploring different strategies, checking my work along the way, and being open to changing my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about computing the value of \\( x \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots\\right)=1+\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{x^2}+\\frac{1}{x^3}+\\cdots\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Series Involved:** The left-hand side (LHS) contains two infinite series multiplied together. The first series looks like a geometric series with a common ratio, and the second one alternates signs.\n  \n- **Geometric Series Recall:** I remember that geometric series converge under certain conditions. The sum of an infinite geometric series is \\(\\frac{a}{1 - r}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n- **Right-Hand Side (RHS) Interpretation:** The right side is another infinite series, similar to the LHS series but each term is \\(\\frac{1}{x^n}\\). This looks like a geometric series as well.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Sum the Infinite Series Individually:** Compute the sum of each series on the LHS separately and then multiply them. This might simplify the equation.\n  \n2. **Recognize Patterns with Geometric Series:** Maybe relate the sums to known forms of geometric series to find a direct relationship with \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Consider the Product of Two Series:** Think about how multiplying two infinite series affects convergence and the resulting sum.\n\n**Wait a moment, I'm not entirely sure if summing them directly will lead to a straightforward equation. Perhaps there's a simpler way by recognizing patterns.**\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Sum the Infinite Series Individually**\n\n**Step 1: Compute the Sum of the First Series**\n\n\\[\nS_1 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\n- **Identifying the Series:** This is a geometric series where:\n  - First term \\(a = 1\\)\n  - Common ratio \\(r = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\n- **Check Convergence:** Since \\(|r| < 1\\), the series converges.\n\n- **Sum Formula:**  \n  \\[\n  S_1 = \\frac{a}{1 - r} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** That seems correct because a geometric series with a common ratio less than 1 converges. **Quick check:** \\(1 + \\frac{1}{2} = 1.5; 1.5 + \\frac{1}{4} = 1.75; 1.75 + \\frac{1}{8} = 1.875\\), and it approaches 2.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Sum of the Second Series**\n\n\\[\nS_2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{8} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\n- **Identifying the Series:** This is also a geometric series with:\n  - First term \\(a = 1\\)\n  - Common ratio \\(r = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\n- **Check Convergence:** Again, since \\(|r| < 1\\), the series converges.\n\n- **Sum Formula:**  \n  \\[\n  S_2 = \\frac{a}{1 - r} = \\frac{1}{1 - (-\\frac{1}{2})} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** This also seems correct. **Quick check:** \\(1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}; \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}; \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{5}{8}\\), approaching \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the Two Sums**\n\n\\[\nS_1 \\times S_2 = 2 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, the LHS simplifies to \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\). **Check:** Multiplying 2 by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) makes sense. \n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Relate the LHS to the RHS**\n\n**Observation:** The RHS is an infinite geometric series:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2} + \\frac{1}{x^3} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\n- **Identifying the Series:** \n  - First term \\(a = 1\\)\n  - Common ratio \\(r = \\frac{1}{x}\\)\n\n- **Sum Formula:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{If } |r| < 1, \\text{ then } \\frac{1}{x} < 1 \\implies |x| > 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sum } S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{x}} = \\frac{x}{x - 1}\n  \\]\n\n**Wait, that seems off because...** We found that \\(S_1 \\times S_2 = \\frac{4}{3}\\), but according to the RHS, we should also have a sum equal to \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Let's equate the two:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{x}{x - 1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This gives us an equation to solve for \\(x\\). **Quick check:** Does \\(\\frac{x}{x - 1}\\) equal \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) for some \\(x\\)? Let's solve it.\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Equation for \\(x\\)**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{x - 1} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Cross Multiply**\n\n\\[\n3x = 4(x - 1)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This is a straightforward equation. **Check:** Does expanding \\(4(x - 1)\\) make sense? Let's proceed.\n\n\\[\n3x = 4x - 4\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Bring All Terms Involving \\(x\\) to One Side**\n\n\\[\n3x - 4x = -4 \\implies -x = -4\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\(x\\)**\n\n\\[\nx = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, \\(x = 4\\). **Quick check:** Does plugging \\(x = 4\\) back into \\(\\frac{x}{x - 1}\\) equal \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\)?\n  \n\\[\n\\frac{4}{4 - 1} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n  \nYep, that checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Verification**\n\n**LHS Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\cdots\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\cdots\\right) = 2 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**RHS Calculation with \\(x = 4\\):**\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\cdots = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n- **Sum of RHS Series:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Common ratio } r = \\frac{1}{4}, \\text{ so } |x| > 1 \\text{ is satisfied.}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  S = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{4}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Both sides equal \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) when \\(x = 4\\), so our solution is verified.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough exploring different strategies, I determined that summing each infinite series on the LHS separately and then equating their product to the sum on the RHS in terms of \\(x\\) was the correct approach. This led me to solve for \\(x = 4\\), which satisfies the equation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nx = 4\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** All calculations align, and substituting \\(x = 4\\) into the RHS confirms the equality holds true.",
