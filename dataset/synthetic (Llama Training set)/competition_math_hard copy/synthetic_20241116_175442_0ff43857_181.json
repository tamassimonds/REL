    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem just like I would tackle it on paper, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and naturally checking along the way. Here's how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is to express \\(0.\\overline{1} + 0.\\overline{01} + 0.\\overline{0001}\\) as a common fraction. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like dealing with repeating decimals. I remember there are standard methods to convert repeating decimals to fractions, but I\u2019m not sure if applying them directly to each term and then adding works best.\n  \n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Convert Each Decimal Separately to a Fraction:** This seems straightforward\u2014convert \\(0.\\overline{1}\\), \\(0.\\overline{01}\\), and \\(0.\\overline{0001}\\) individually to fractions, then add them together.\n  \n  2. **Sum the Repeating Parts First:** Maybe there's a pattern or a series sum that can be used to add these decimals more efficiently.\n\n  3. **Use a Single Conversion for the Entire Expression:** Convert the entire sum as one repeating decimal, if possible.\n\n- **Exploring the First Strategy:** Let's try converting each decimal separately first. If it gets too messy or complicated, I'll reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Converting \\(0.\\overline{1}\\) to a Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis is a simple repeating decimal with a single digit. I recall the method where you multiply by a power of 10 to shift the decimal place.\n\n**Calculations:**\n  \n1. **Let \\(x = 0.\\overline{1}\\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 0.11111\\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Multiply both sides by 10 to shift the decimal:**\n   \\[\n   10x = 1.11111\\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Subtract the original \\(x\\) from this equation:**\n   \\[\n   10x - x = 1.11111\\ldots - 0.11111\\ldots\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9x = 1\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1}{9}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**  \nCheck: \\(\\frac{1}{9} = 0.11111\\ldots\\), which matches the original decimal. This conversion seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Converting \\(0.\\overline{01}\\) to a Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, this repeating decimal has two digits. I need to multiply by 100 to shift the decimal two places.\n\n**Calculations:**\n  \n1. **Let \\(y = 0.\\overline{01}\\):**\n   \\[\n   y = 0.010101\\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Multiply both sides by 100:**\n   \\[\n   100y = 1.010101\\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Subtract the original \\(y\\):**\n   \\[\n   100y - y = 1.010101\\ldots - 0.010101\\ldots\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   99y = 1\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Solve for \\(y\\):**\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{1}{99}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**  \nCheck: \\(\\frac{1}{99} = 0.010101\\ldots\\), which matches the original decimal. This conversion also seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Converting \\(0.\\overline{0001}\\) to a Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis repeating decimal has four digits. I need to multiply by 10,000 to shift the decimal four places.\n\n**Calculations:**\n  \n1. **Let \\(z = 0.\\overline{0001}\\):**\n   \\[\n   z = 0.000100010001\\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Multiply both sides by 10,000:**\n   \\[\n   10,000z = 1.000100010001\\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Subtract the original \\(z\\):**\n   \\[\n   10,000z - z = 1.000100010001\\ldots - 0.000100010001\\ldots\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9,999z = 1\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Solve for \\(z\\):**\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{1}{9,999}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**  \nCheck: \\(\\frac{1}{9,999} = 0.000100010001\\ldots\\), which matches the original decimal. This conversion seems correct as well.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Adding the Fractions Together**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I've converted each decimal to a fraction, I need to find a common denominator to add them. Let's see if there's a common multiple of 9, 99, and 9,999.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute\u2014each denominator is a multiple of 9:\n- \\(9 = 9 \\times 1\\)\n- \\(99 = 9 \\times 11\\)\n- \\(9,999 = 9 \\times 1,111\\)\n\nSo, the common denominator can be \\(9,999\\) (since it's the least common multiple of \\(9\\), \\(99\\), and \\(9,999\\)).\n\n**Calculations:**\n  \n1. **Express each fraction with a common denominator:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{1 \\times 1,111}{9 \\times 1,111} = \\frac{1,111}{9,999}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{99} = \\frac{1 \\times 101}{99 \\times 101} = \\frac{101}{9,999}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{9,999} = \\frac{1}{9,999}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Add the fractions:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1,111}{9,999} + \\frac{101}{9,999} + \\frac{1}{9,999} = \\frac{1,111 + 101 + 1}{9,999} = \\frac{1,213}{9,999}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**  \nCheck: Adding the numerators gives \\(1,213\\), and the denominator remains \\(9,999\\). At first glance, this seems correct, but let's simplify the fraction to see if it can be reduced further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Simplifying the Fraction \\(\\frac{1,213}{9,999}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's see if \\(1,213\\) and \\(9,999\\) have a common factor other than 1. If they do, we can simplify the fraction.\n\n**Calculations:**\n  \n1. **Factorize \\(9,999\\):**\n   \\[\n   9,999 = 9 \\times 1,111 = 3^2 \\times 1,111\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Check if \\(1,111\\) is divisible by 11:**\n   \\[\n   1,111 \\div 11 = 101\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Therefore:**\n   \\[\n   9,999 = 9 \\times 11 \\times 101 = 3^2 \\times 11 \\times 101\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Factorize \\(1,213\\):**\n   \\[\n   1,213 \\div 11 = 110\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   1,213 = 11 \\times 110 = 11 \\times 10 \\times 11 = 11^2 \\times 10\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Simplify \\(\\frac{1,213}{9,999}\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{11^2 \\times 10}{3^2 \\times 11 \\times 101} = \\frac{11 \\times 10}{3^2 \\times 101} = \\frac{110}{9,099}\n   \\]\n   \n6. **Check Division:**\n   - \\(9,099 = 3^2 \\times 1,011\\)\n   - \\(1,011 = 3 \\times 337\\)\n   - So, \\(9,099 = 3^2 \\times 3 \\times 337 = 3^3 \\times 337\\)\n\n7. **Simplify Further:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{110}{9,099} = \\frac{11 \\times 10}{3^3 \\times 337} = \\frac{110}{9,099}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**  \nCheck: It seems I made an error in factorization earlier. Let me re-examine the factors carefully.\n\n**Spotting the Error:**\nUpon closer inspection, \\(1,213\\) does not factor neatly as \\(11^2 \\times 10\\). In fact, \\(1,213\\) is a prime number itself.\n\n**Correct Factorization:**\n\\[\n1,213 = 1,213 \\text{ (prime number)}\n\\]\n\\[\n9,999 = 3^2 \\times 11 \\times 101 = 9 \\times 1,111\n\\]\n\\[\n1,111 = 11 \\times 101\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow 9,999 = 3^2 \\times 11 \\times 101\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1,213}{9,999} = \\frac{1,213}{3^2 \\times 11 \\times 101}\n\\]\n  \nGiven that \\(1,213\\) is a prime number, and \\(9,999\\) is composed of different prime factors (\\(3\\), \\(11\\), and \\(101\\)), the fraction cannot be simplified further.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1,213}{9,999}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Quick Checks:**\n- Adding the fractions and simplifying steps seem correct.\n- The final fraction cannot be reduced further since \\(1,213\\) is prime relative to the factors of \\(9,999\\).\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\n- The approach of converting each repeating decimal separately worked well.\n- Ensuring the common denominator was correct helped in straightforward addition.\n- Factorization confirmed that the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nExpressing \\(0.\\overline{1} + 0.\\overline{01} + 0.\\overline{0001}\\) as a common fraction results in:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1,213}{9,999}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nLooking back, starting with individual conversions made the problem manageable. Initially, considering a single conversion for the entire sum crossed my mind, but that seemed risky and complex. By tackling each decimal separately, I could verify each step, ensuring accuracy before proceeding to the next.\n\nThroughout the process, reflections and checks were crucial. Spotting an error in factorization led me to correct the final fraction, ensuring it was simplified correctly. This human-like thinking\u2014checking, reflecting, and adjusting\u2014ensured that the solution was not only correct but also logically sound.\n\nI hope this detailed, step-by-step approach aligns with what you were looking for.

  "ground_truth": "We begin this problem by summing $0.\\overline{1}$, $0.\\overline{01}$, and $0.\\overline{0001}$ as decimals. We do this by realizing that $0.\\overline{1}$ can also be written as $0.\\overline{1111}$ and that $0.\\overline{01}$ can be written as $0.\\overline{0101}$. Thus, $0.\\overline{1}+0.\\overline{01}+0.\\overline{0001}=0.\\overline{1111}+0.\\overline{0101}+0.\\overline{0001}=0.\\overline{1213}$. (Since there is no carrying involved, we can add each decimal place with no problems.)\n\nTo express the number $0.\\overline{1213}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10000x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&10000x &=& 1213&.12131213\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.12131213\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&9999x &=& 1213 &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{1213} = \\boxed{\\frac{1213}{9999}}$.\n\n(Note: We have to check that this answer is in lowest terms. The prime factorization of $9999$ is $3^2\\cdot 11\\cdot 101$, so we must check that $1213$ is not divisible by $3$, $11$, or $101$.\n\nSince $1+2+1+3=7$ is not a multiple of $3$, neither is $1213$. Also, $1213 = 11^2\\cdot 10 + 3 = 101\\cdot 12 + 1$, so $1213$ can't be a multiple of $11$ or $101$.)"
