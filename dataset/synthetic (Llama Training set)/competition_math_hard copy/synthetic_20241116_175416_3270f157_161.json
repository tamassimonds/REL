    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on whether they're correct, and adjusting my approach as needed. It's important to think out loud, make mistakes, and learn from them, just like how a human would tackle a problem.\n\n---\n\n## **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, so we have a frustum of a right circular cone. It's formed by cutting off a smaller cone from the top of a larger cone. We know the following:\n\n- The **frustum** has an altitude (height) of \\(24\\) cm.\n- The **area of the lower base** is \\(225\\pi\\) sq cm.\n- The **area of the upper base** is \\(25\\pi\\) sq cm.\n\nThe goal is to find the **altitude of the small cone that was cut off**.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Similar Triangles:** Since both the frustum and the original cone are right circular, maybe there's a similarity relationship we can use.\n  \n- **Volume Relationships:** Perhaps the volumes of the cones involved can help, but we don't have all the heights directly.\n\n- **Surface Area:** The given areas might relate to the radii, and maybe the heights can be linked through the geometry.\n\n**Reflection:** \nI initially think about using the ratio of areas to find the ratio of the radii, which could then help in finding the height. This seems like a good starting point, but let's explore it further.\n\n---\n\n## **Exploring the Area-to-Radius Relationship**\n\n**Step 1: Relate Areas to Radii**\n\nThe area of a circle is given by:\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2\n\\]\nwhere \\(A\\) is the area and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf we have the areas of both bases, we can find their radii using the formula for the area of a circle.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Lower Base Area:**\n   \\[\n   225\\pi = \\pi r_{\\text{lower}}^2 \\implies r_{\\text{lower}}^2 = 225 \\implies r_{\\text{lower}} = 15 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Upper Base Area:**\n   \\[\n   25\\pi = \\pi r_{\\text{upper}}^2 \\implies r_{\\text{upper}}^2 = 25 \\implies r_{\\text{upper}} = 5 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\nThis seems straightforward, and the radii make sense. Now, let's see how these radii relate to the heights.\n\n---\n\n## **Applying Similar Triangles**\n\n**Step 2: Understanding Similarity in Cones**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe original cone and the small cone that was cut off are similar because they're both right circular cones. Therefore, their corresponding dimensions are proportional.\n\n**Given:**\n\n- The altitude of the frustum is \\(24\\) cm.\n- The ratio of the radii of the bases is \\(r_{\\text{lower}} : r_{\\text{upper}} = 15 : 5 = 3 : 1\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\(H\\) = Total height of the original cone.\n- \\(h\\) = Height of the small cone that was cut off.\n\nSince the cones are similar, the ratio of their heights is the same as the ratio of their radii:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{H}{h} = \\frac{15}{5} = 3\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\nH = 3h\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis proportional relationship is crucial. It connects the height of the original cone to the height of the small cone. Now, we can relate these heights to the frustum's height.\n\n---\n\n## **Relating Heights to the Frustum**\n\n**Step 3: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe height of the frustum (\\(24\\) cm) is the difference between the heights of the original cone and the small cone:\n\n\\[\nH - h = 24\n\\]\n\nBut we also have \\(H = 3h\\). We can substitute this into the equation.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n3h - h = 24 \\implies 2h = 24 \\implies h = 12 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis result indicates that the height of the small cone that was cut off is \\(12\\) cm. Let me double-check this:\n\n- If \\(h = 12\\) cm, then:\n  \\[\n  H = 3h = 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n- The frustum's height is \\(H - h = 36 - 12 = 24\\) cm, which matches the given.\n\n**Check:**\nEverything checks out. The calculations are consistent with the given dimensions.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Radii Calculation:** Determined the radii of the lower and upper bases from their areas.\n- **Similarity Ratio:** Established the relationship between the heights of the original and small cones using the similarity of triangles.\n- **Height of Small Cone:** Solved for the height of the small cone by relating it to the frustum's height.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe altitude of the small cone that was cut off is **12 cm**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nThroughout the process, I explored different strategies, starting with the area-to-radius relationship and then applying the concept of similar triangles. Checking at each step ensured the calculations were correct, leading to a consistent and logical conclusion. This approach mirrors human problem-solving, where brainstorming, reflecting, and verifying each step is essential.\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding how to approach similar problems!",

  "ground_truth": "The two bases are circles, and the area of a circle is $\\pi r^2$. If the area of the upper base (which is also the base of the small cone) is $25\\pi$ sq cm, then its radius is $5$ cm, and the radius of the lower base is $15$ cm.   The upper base, therefore, has a radius that is $\\frac{1}{3}$ the size of the radius of the smaller base.  Because the slope of the sides of a cone is uniform, the frustum must have been cut off $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way up the cone, so $x$ is $\\frac13$ of the total height of the cone, $H$.  We can now solve for $x$, because we know that the height of the frustum, $24$ cm is $\\frac23$ of the total height. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2}{3}H&=24\\\\\nH&=36\\\\\nx&=H\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx&=36\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx&=12\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the height of the small cone is $\\boxed{12}$ centimeters."
