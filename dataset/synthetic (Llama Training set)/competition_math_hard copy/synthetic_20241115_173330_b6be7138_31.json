    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work often, and adjust my approach as needed. I want to mimic human thinking as closely as possible, including making mistakes and having those \"aha\" moments. Let's get started!\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem **\\(\\sqrt{53 + 20\\sqrt{7}}\\)****, I think it looks similar to expressions that can be simplified into the form **\\(a + b\\sqrt{c}\\)**. This reminds me of simplifying square roots involving binomials. However, I'm not entirely sure if that's the right path. Maybe there\u2019s another method, but let\u2019s start by exploring what I know.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Express as a Binomial Square:**\n   - Try to express **\\(53 + 20\\sqrt{7}\\)** as **\\((a + b\\sqrt{c})^2\\)**.\n   - This looks promising because squaring a binomial gives a similar form.\n\n2. **Use Rationalization Techniques:**\n   - Perhaps rationalizing the expression might help, but typically, rationalization is for denominators.\n\n3. **Numerical Approximation:**\n   - I could estimate the value numerically to get a sense of the answer, but that wouldn't be precise.\n\n4. **Check Patterns with Known Squares:**\n   - Maybe recognizing patterns or known perfect squares could simplify the process.\n\nFor now, expressing it as a binomial square feels like the most direct approach. Let's go with that and see where it leads.\n\n### **Step 1: Assuming Binomial Square**\n\nI\u2019ll assume that:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{53 + 20\\sqrt{7}} = a + b\\sqrt{c}\n\\]\n\nwhere **\\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\)** are integers, and **\\(c\\)** is not a perfect square other than 1. \n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nThis seems logical because squaring a binomial results in a similar structure to our expression. But, I need to ensure that **\\(c\\)** remains as required.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nBefore proceeding, I want to make sure this assumption is valid. Squaring **\\(a + b\\sqrt{c}\\)** gives **\\(a^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{c} + b^2c\\)**, which has a rational part and an irrational part. This matches our initial expression's structure, so it should work.\n\n### **Step 2: Squaring Both Sides**\n\nIf I square both sides, I get:\n\n\\[\n53 + 20\\sqrt{7} = (a + b\\sqrt{c})^2 = a^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{c} + b^2c\n\\]\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nThis expands the right side into a rational and an irrational part, which should match the left side's parts.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nI see that the rational parts and the irrational parts must correspond separately. Let\u2019s set up equations based on that.\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up Equations**\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n\\[\n53 + 20\\sqrt{7} = a^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{c} + b^2c\n\\]\n\nI can separate the rational and irrational parts:\n\n- **Rational Part:** \\(a^2 + b^2c = 53\\)\n- **Irrational Part:** \\(2ab\\sqrt{c} = 20\\sqrt{7}\\)\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nThis gives me two equations to work with. I can solve them simultaneously to find **\\(a\\)**, **\\(b\\)**, and **\\(c\\)**.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nHowever, there are three variables (**\\(a\\)**, **\\(b\\)**, **\\(c\\)**) but only two equations. Wait, that might be problematic. Maybe assuming **\\(c\\)** helps, or perhaps there's another relationship.\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring the Irrational Equation**\n\nFocusing on the irrational part:\n\n\\[\n2ab\\sqrt{c} = 20\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\nI can divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nab\\sqrt{c} = 10\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nThis simplifies the equation. If I can find a relationship between **\\(a\\)**, **\\(b\\)**, and **\\(c\\)**, I can proceed.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nLet's try to find possible values for **\\(a\\)** and **\\(b\\)** that satisfy this equation. Maybe assuming **\\(c = 7\\)** could work since **\\(\\sqrt{7}\\)** is already part of the equation.\n\n### **Step 5: Assuming \\(c = 7\\)**\n\nIf I assume **\\(c = 7\\)**, then:\n\n\\[\nab\\sqrt{7} = 10\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nThis implies **\\(ab = 10\\)**. Now I have:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 7b^2 = 53 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad ab = 10\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nThis seems manageable. I can solve these two equations for **\\(a\\)** and **\\(b\\)**.\n\n### **Step 6: Solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**\n\nFrom **\\(ab = 10\\)**, I can express **\\(b = \\frac{10}{a}\\)**. Substituting into the first equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 7\\left(\\frac{10}{a}\\right)^2 = 53\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 7 \\times \\frac{100}{a^2} = 53\n\\]\n\\[\na^2 + \\frac{700}{a^2} = 53\n\\]\n\\[\na^4 - 53a^2 + 700 = 0 \\quad \\text{(Multiplying both sides by \\(a^2\\))}\n\\]\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nNow, I have a quartic equation in terms of **\\(a^2\\)**. This looks a bit messy, but let's see if it factors nicely.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nBefore proceeding, maybe I can try to factor this equation or use the quadratic formula. Wait, factoring seems tricky here. Let\u2019s attempt the quadratic formula approach.\n\n### **Step 7: Applying the Quadratic Formula**\n\nLet\u2019s set **\\(x = a^2\\)**, so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 53x + 700 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{53 \\pm \\sqrt{(-53)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 700}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{53 \\pm \\sqrt{2809 - 2800}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{53 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{53 \\pm 3}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{56}{2} = 28 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n\\]\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nSo, **\\(a^2 = 28\\)** or **\\(a^2 = 25\\)**. Therefore, **\\(a = \\sqrt{28} = 2\\sqrt{7}\\)** or **\\(a = \\sqrt{25} = 5\\)**.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nHmm, having **\\(a = 2\\sqrt{7}\\)** seems unusual since we're looking for integers. But maybe it's okay. Let\u2019s check both cases.\n\n### **Step 8: Checking \\(a = 5\\) and \\(a = 2\\sqrt{7}\\)**\n\n**Case 1:** \\(a = 5\\)\n\nFrom **\\(ab = 10\\)**:\n\n\\[\n5b = 10 \\implies b = 2\n\\]\n\nNow, with \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = 2\\), check the rational part equation:\n\n\\[\n5^2 + 7 \\times 2^2 = 25 + 28 = 53\n\\]\n\nThis satisfies the equation.\n\n**Case 2:** \\(a = 2\\sqrt{7}\\)\n\nFrom **\\(ab = 10\\)**:\n\n\\[\n(2\\sqrt{7})b = 10 \\implies b = \\frac{10}{2\\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{7}\n\\]\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nIn Case 2, \\(b = \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{7}\\), which is not an integer. But, the original problem asks for integers **\\(a\\)**, **\\(b\\)**, and **\\(c\\)**. This suggests that our assumption about **\\(c\\)** being **\\(7\\)** might be incorrect.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nWait, maybe assuming **\\(c = 7\\)** led us to a non-integer solution, which doesn't align with the problem's requirements. We need to reconsider our approach.\n\n### **Step 9: Re-evaluating the Assumption**\n\nPerhaps **\\(c\\)** should be another value that allows **\\(a\\)** and **\\(b\\)** to remain integers. Let\u2019s think about different perfect squares that could fit.\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nSince **\\(\\sqrt{7}\\)** is already in the original expression, maybe **\\(c\\)** could be something other than **\\(7\\)** but still related.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nLet\u2019s brainstorm alternative values for **\\(c\\)**. What if **\\(c\\)** is a perfect square that's not **\\(7\\)** but still causes the irrational part to simplify correctly?\n\n### **Step 10: Looking for Alternative Solutions**\n\nWhat if instead of assuming **\\(c = 7\\)**, we let **\\(c\\)** be another square that still aligns with the given expression?\n\nLet\u2019s consider:\n\n\\[\nab\\sqrt{c} = 10\\sqrt{7} \n\\]\n\nIf **\\(\\sqrt{c} = \\sqrt{7}\\)**, then:\n\n\\[\nab = 10 \n\\]\n\nBut, as seen earlier, this led to non-integer **\\(b\\)**. Therefore, **\\(c\\)** must be something that simplifies **\\(10\\sqrt{7}\\)** correctly.\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nPerhaps **\\(c\\)** could be **\\(7\\)** again, but maybe I've miscalculated. Let's re-examine the irrational part equation.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nGiven that assuming **\\(c = 7\\)** led to non-integer solutions, I should reconsider whether **\\(c\\)** can be **\\(7\\)** or if another perfect square is necessary.\n\n### **Step 11: Re-attempting \\(c = 7\\) with Integer Solutions**\n\nLet\u2019s try again with **\\(c = 7\\)** and see if there's an integer solution I missed.\n\nReturning to:\n\n\\[\nab\\sqrt{7} = 10\\sqrt{7} \n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by **\\(\\sqrt{7}\\)**:\n\n\\[\nab = 10 \n\\]\n\nAnd the rational part:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 7b^2 = 53 \n\\]\n\nNow, I have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nab = 10 \\\\\na^2 + 7b^2 = 53 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nWith **\\(ab = 10\\)**, I can express **\\(b = \\frac{10}{a}\\)** and substitute back to solve for **\\(a\\)**.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nLet's see if substituting **\\(b = \\frac{10}{a}\\)** into **\\(a^2 + 7b^2 = 53\\)** leads to integer solutions.\n\n### **Step 12: Substituting \\(b = \\frac{10}{a}\\) into the Rational Equation**\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 7\\left(\\frac{10}{a}\\right)^2 = 53 \n\\]\n\\[\na^2 + 7 \\times \\frac{100}{a^2} = 53 \n\\]\n\\[\na^4 - 53a^2 + 700 = 0 \\quad \\text{(Multiplying both sides by \\(a^2\\))}\n\\]\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nThis brings me back to the quartic equation I had earlier. Maybe attempting to factor this equation could help find integer solutions.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nLet\u2019s try to factor or find integer roots for **\\(a^4 - 53a^2 + 700 = 0\\)**.\n\n### **Step 13: Factoring the Quartic Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s set **\\(x = a^2\\)**, so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 53x + 700 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, let's see if this quadratic equation factors nicely.\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nI need two numbers that multiply to **\\(700\\)** and add up to **\\(53\\)**. Let\u2019s list the possible factor pairs of **\\(700\\)**:\n\n\\[\n700 = 1 \\times 700 \\\\\n700 = 2 \\times 350 \\\\\n700 = 4 \\times 175 \\\\\n700 = 7 \\times 100 \\\\\n700 = 10 \\times 70 \\\\\n700 = 14 \\times 50 \\\\\n700 = 25 \\times 28\n\\]\n\nAmong these, the pair that adds up to **\\(53\\)** is **\\(25\\) and \\(28\\)**.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nWait, this seems too straightforward. Can it be that the problem is designed this way? Let\u2019s proceed with this factoring.\n\n### **Step 14: Factoring the Equation**\n\nThe quadratic equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 53x + 700 = (x - 25)(x - 28) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, **\\(x = 25\\)** or **\\(x = 28\\)**.\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nThis means **\\(a^2 = 25\\)** or **\\(a^2 = 28\\)**. Taking square roots:\n\n\\[\na = 5 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a = \\sqrt{28} = 2\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nHmm, similar to before, **\\(a = 5\\)** gives an integer solution, while **\\(a = 2\\sqrt{7}\\)** does not. Since the problem requests integers, let's focus on **\\(a = 5\\)**.\n\n### **Step 15: Solving for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) with \\(a = 5\\)**\n\nFrom **\\(ab = 10\\)**:\n\n\\[\n5b = 10 \\implies b = 2\n\\]\n\nNow, with **\\(a = 5\\)** and **\\(b = 2\\)**, check the rational part equation:\n\n\\[\n5^2 + 7(2)^2 = 25 + 28 = 53\n\\]\n\nThis satisfies the equation.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nThis aligns perfectly with the original equation. Therefore, **\\(a = 5\\)**, **\\(b = 2\\)**, and **\\(c = 7\\)**.\n\n### **Step 16: Finalizing the Answer**\n\nNow, according to the problem, we need to find **\\(a + b + c\\)**:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = 5 + 2 + 7 = 14\n\\]\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\nThe values seem to satisfy all parts of the original equation, and the sum **\\(14\\)** makes sense.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nLet\u2019s double-check by plugging **\\(a = 5\\)**, **\\(b = 2\\)**, and **\\(c = 7\\)** back into the original expression to ensure everything fits.\n\n### **Step 17: Verifying the Solution**\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{53 + 20\\sqrt{7}}\n\\]\n\nAssuming:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{53 + 20\\sqrt{7}} = 5 + 2\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides to verify:\n\n\\[\n(5 + 2\\sqrt{7})^2 = 25 + 20\\sqrt{7} + 28 = 53 + 20\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n\nThis matches the original expression exactly.\n\n#### **Final Thoughts:**\nThe solution checks out. **\\(a + b + c = 14\\)** is indeed the correct answer.\n\n#### **Final Reflection:**\nBy exploring different strategies and carefully checking each step, I confirmed that the correct values are **\\(a = 5\\)**, **\\(b = 2\\)**, and **\\(c = 7\\)**, leading to **\\(a + b + c = 14\\)**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThrough brainstorming, trying different approaches, and reflecting on each step, I've determined that **\\(\\sqrt{53 + 20\\sqrt{7}} = 5 + 2\\sqrt{7}\\)**, resulting in **\\(a + b + c = 14\\)**. Checking and re-evaluating along the way ensured the solution's correctness.",
