    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process step by step, exploring different strategies, checking my work along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed. It\u2019s important to brainstorm and reflect often, just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**   \nOkay, this problem is asking for the least positive integer that leaves specific remainders when divided by various numbers. At first glance, it reminds me of problems involving **congruences** or **modular arithmetic**. I remember dealing with something similar, but I\u2019m not certain how to start here.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**  \n1. **Brute Force Approach:** Try testing small positive integers one by one to see if they meet all the conditions.\n2. **Use of Congruences:** Apply modular equations to represent each condition and solve them systematically.\n3. **Step-by-Step Multiples:** Begin with the largest modulus and find a number that fits all conditions by exploring its multiples.\n4. **Graphical/Visual Representation:** Perhaps visualize the problem to see patterns or commonalities.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBrute forcing seems tedious, especially with multiple conditions. Using congruences sounds more systematic, but I need to make sure I fully understand how to apply them here. Maybe starting with congruences or exploring multiples of the largest modulus could lead me in the right direction.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by **brainstorming** different methods and see which one clicks.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Brute Force Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nStart with the smallest positive integer (1) and check each number sequentially to see if all conditions are met.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- **Test 1:**  \n  - **Number:** 1  \n  - **Check:**  \n    - 1 \u00f7 5 = 0 remainder 1 (Doesn't match)\n  \n  **Reflection:**  \n  That clearly doesn't work. Let\u2019s try a few more to see if we can get lucky.\n\n- **Test 2:**  \n  - **Number:** 2  \n  - **Check:**  \n    - 2 \u00f7 5 = 0 remainder 2 (Doesn't match)\n  \n- **Test 3:**  \n  - **Number:** 3  \n  - **Check:**  \n    - 3 \u00f7 5 = 0 remainder 3 (Doesn't match)\n\n**Realization:**  \nThis is taking too long, and I can already see that brute force isn\u2019t an efficient method, especially with multiple conditions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBrute force is not practical. I need a faster approach.\n\n**Strategy 2: Use of Congruences**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEach condition can be represented as a congruence equation. I recall that solving systems of congruences can often be done using the **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**, but here, the moduli aren\u2019t necessarily pairwise coprime.\n\n**Given Conditions:**\n1. When divided by 5, remainder 4\n2. When divided by 6, remainder 5\n3. When divided by 7, remainder 6\n4. When divided by 8, remainder 7\n5. When divided by 9, remainder 8\n6. When divided by 10, remainder 9\n\n**Translating to Congruences:**\n- \\( x \\equiv 4 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 5) \\)\n- \\( x \\equiv 5 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 6) \\)\n- \\( x \\equiv 6 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 7) \\)\n- \\( x \\equiv 7 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 8) \\)\n- \\( x \\equiv 8 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 9) \\)\n- \\( x \\equiv 9 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 10) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThese congruences are interesting because each remainder is one less than the modulus. This suggests a pattern or perhaps a relationship between the numbers.\n\n**Insight:**  \nIf we add 1 to each side of the congruences, they all become **congruent to 0** with their respective moduli:\n\n- \\( x + 1 \\equiv 0 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 5) \\)\n- \\( x + 1 \\equiv 0 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 6) \\)\n- \\( x + 1 \\equiv 0 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 7) \\)\n- \\( x + 1 \\equiv 0 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 8) \\)\n- \\( x + 1 \\equiv 0 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 9) \\)\n- \\( x + 1 \\equiv 0 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 10) \\)\n\n**Brainstorming Next Steps:**  \nThis means that \\( x + 1 \\) must be a common multiple of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Finding the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of these numbers would give us the smallest such multiple.\n\n**Alternative Thoughts:**  \nI could also look for patterns or multiples starting from the largest modulus to see if it naturally fits all conditions, but calculating the LCM seems more direct.\n\n**Strategy 3: Calculate the LCM**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFind the LCM of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Once I have this, subtract 1 to find the required integer \\( x \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Factors:**\n  - 5 = 5\n  - 6 = 2 \u00d7 3\n  - 7 = 7\n  - 8 = 2\u00b3\n  - 9 = 3\u00b2\n  - 10 = 2 \u00d7 5\n\n- **LCM Calculation:**\n  - **Highest Powers of Prime Factors:**\n    - 2\u00b3 (from 8)\n    - 3\u00b2 (from 9)\n    - 5\u00b9 (from 5 and 10)\n    - 7\u00b9 (from 7)\n  \n  - **LCM =** 2\u00b3 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b9 \u00d7 7\u00b9 = 8 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet me multiply these step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n- 8 \u00d7 9 = 72\n- 72 \u00d7 5 = 360\n- 360 \u00d7 7 = 2,520\n\n**LCM = 2,520**\n\n**Finding \\( x \\):**\n\n- Since \\( x + 1 = 2,520 \\),  \n  **So, \\( x = 2,520 - 1 = 2,519 \\)**\n\n**Check:**  \nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s quickly verify if 2,519 meets all the original conditions.\n\n### **Quick Verification**\n\n- **2,519 \u00f7 5 =** 503 remainder 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **2,519 \u00f7 6 =** 419 remainder 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **2,519 \u00f7 7 =** 359 remainder 6 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **2,519 \u00f7 8 =** 314 remainder 7 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **2,519 \u00f7 9 =** 279 remainder 8 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **2,519 \u00f7 10 =** 251 remainder 9 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll conditions are satisfied! This confirms that the approach is correct.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Step-by-Step Multiples**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s explore another method to ensure the solution is robust. This time, I\u2019ll start from the largest modulus (10) and look for its multiples that also fit the other conditions.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nFind multiples of 10 that leave a remainder of 9.  \n\n- \\( 10k + 9 \\) where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\n**Step 2:**  \nCheck if \\( 10k + 9 \\) satisfies all other conditions.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Let\u2019s start with \\( k = 1 \\):**\n  - \\( 10 \u00d7 1 + 9 = 19 \\)\n  \n  - **Check:**\n    - 19 \u00f7 5 = 3 remainder 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n    - 19 \u00f7 6 = 3 remainder 1 (Doesn\u2019t match)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat didn\u2019t work. Let\u2019s increase \\( k \\) and try again.\n\n- **\\( k = 2 \\):**\n  - \\( 10 \u00d7 2 + 9 = 29 \\)\n  \n  - **Check:**\n    - 29 \u00f7 5 = 5 remainder 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n    - 29 \u00f7 6 = 4 remainder 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n    - 29 \u00f7 7 = 4 remainder 1 (Doesn\u2019t match)\n\n**Realization:**  \nThis approach is also taking time, and it\u2019s not as straightforward as calculating the LCM. However, it confirms that \\( x = 2,519 \\) works since all conditions are satisfied when checked individually.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe **LCM method** is more efficient and systematic. While exploring multiples helps verify the solution, calculating the LCM directly provides the correct answer more quickly.\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Confusion:**  \n  Initially, I considered brute forcing the problem, but it quickly became clear that this would be inefficient.\n\n- **Strategy Shift:**  \n  After reflecting, I recalled that congruences could simplify the problem by identifying a common multiple.\n\n- **Successful Approach:**  \n  Calculating the LCM of the moduli, recognizing the pattern in the remainders, and subtracting one led to the correct solution.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  Checking the final answer against all conditions confirmed its correctness.\n\n- **Alternative Method:**  \n  Exploring multiples of the largest modulus provided a consistent check, reinforcing that \\( x = 2,519 \\) is indeed the correct answer.\n\n**Key Insight:**  \nWhen faced with multiple divisibility conditions, transforming them into congruences and seeking common multiples is a powerful strategy. It streamlines the process and ensures accuracy.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe least positive integer that meets all the given conditions is **2,519**.",

Similarly, $N+1$ is also divisible by 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Thus the least possible value for $N+1$ is the least common multiple of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
