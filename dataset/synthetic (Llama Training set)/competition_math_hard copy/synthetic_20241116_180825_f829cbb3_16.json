    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, simulating a human thought process complete with brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, it revolves around selecting a president and a 2-person committee from a group of 8 people, with the condition that the president **cannot** be on the committee. My initial reaction is to think about combinations since we're dealing with choosing individuals from a group.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Maybe I can separate the two selections (president and committee) and calculate each part individually.\n- **Strategy 2:** Consider the total number of ways to select both a president and a committee together.\n- **Strategy 3:** Account for the restriction that the president can't be on the committee by subtracting invalid cases.\n\nRight now, nothing feels completely solid. I recall that combination formulas might be helpful, but I'm unsure how to apply them here, especially with the restriction in place.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Separate Selections**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's try selecting the president first and then the committee. It seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that the committee selection accounts for the president not being included.\n\n**Step 1: Selecting the President**\n\n- We have 8 people to choose from.\n- So, there are **8** ways to select the president.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat makes sense. Each person is eligible to be president, so no restrictions here.\n\n**Step 2: Selecting the 2-Person Committee**\n\n- After selecting the president, 7 people remain eligible for the committee.\n- I need to choose 2 out of these 7.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- The number of ways to choose 2 people from 7 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{7}{2} \\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, the combination formula looks right. Let me quickly verify:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\n**Step 3: Total Combinations for Strategy 1**\n\n- Multiply the number of ways to select the president by the number of ways to select the committee.\n\n  \\[\n  8 \\times 21 = 168\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so according to this strategy, there are **168** total ways. But let's think about it\u2014does this number make sense? *\n\nIt seems reasonable at first glance. But let's cross-check with another strategy to be sure.*\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Total Selections with Restrictions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe I should consider the total number of ways to select both positions simultaneously and then adjust for the restriction. This might provide a different perspective.\n\n**Step 1: Total Number of Ways Without Restriction**\n\n- **Choosing a President:** 8 ways.\n- **Choosing a 2-Person Committee:** \\( \\binom{8}{2} \\) since initially, all 8 are eligible.\n\n  \\[\n  \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, without any restrictions, the total number of ways is:\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 28 = 224\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Accounting for the Restriction**\n\n- **Overlapping Cases:** The cases where the elected president is also part of the committee.\n- **Invalid Cases:** These need to be subtracted since the president can't be on the committee.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- If the president is one of the committee members, it's invalid.\n- Number of such cases:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of ways to choose 1 additional member from the remaining 7} = \\binom{7}{1} = 7\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014this seems off. Only 7 cases? Let me think this through.\n\n**Check:**\n\nThe idea is that if the president is on the committee, we choose one more member from the remaining 7. But isn't this a bit simplistic?*\n\nYes, it might be too simplistic because the committee must have 2 people, and we're only adding one. So, perhaps I need to reconsider this part.*\n\n### **Revisiting Strategy 2: Correcting the Overlap**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThinking it through, if the president is on the committee, we need to choose **one more member** from the remaining 7. But this approach doesn't fully capture all overlapping cases.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nInstead of directly counting overlapping cases, maybe subtract the overestimated cases from Strategy 1's result.\n\n**Step 1: Recalculate Overlapping Cases**\n\n- If the president is on the committee, we have:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total ways with president on committee} = 8 \\times \\binom{7}{1} = 8 \\times 7 = 56\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, does this include all overlapping scenarios?*\n\n*No, it only considers cases where the president is already selected as part of the committee. It doesn't fully align with our strategy 1, which separates selections.*\n\n### **Final Strategy: Combining Insights**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's merge the insights from both strategies:\n\n1. **Total Selections Without Restriction:** 224 (8 presidents \u00d7 28 committees).\n2. **Invalid Overlapping Cases:** 56 (president is part of the committee).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n224 - 56 = 168\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this align with our initial strategy?*\n\n*Yes, both strategies converge to the same number, which enhances confidence in the result.*\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies, correcting overlaps, and combining insights, the total number of valid ways to select a president and a 2-person committee is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{168}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by considering different approaches\u2014separating selections, total with restrictions, and adjusting for overlaps.\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Tried selecting president and committee separately, then reconsidered by looking at total selections and correcting for overlaps.\n- **Reflection and Checkpoints:**\n  - Checked the validity of each step.\n  - Adjusted strategies when initial approaches seemed inadequate.\n- **Final Verification:** Combined insights from both strategies to ensure consistency.\n- **Conclusion:** Arrived at the same number (168) through different pathways, confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\nSpending time reflecting and checking along the way helped identify and correct inconsistencies, leading to a confident and accurate answer.",

  "ground_truth": "We have to first choose a president, and then we have to choose 2 people, but the order in which we choose the people doesn't matter. So first there are 8 ways to choose the president. Then there are 7 ways to choose the first person, and 6 ways to choose second person.  However, we have overcounted, since choosing person A first and person B second will give us the same committee as choosing person B first and person A second.  Each committee is counted twice in our original $7 \\times 6$ count, so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcount, giving us $8\\times(7 \\times 6)/2 = \\boxed{168}$ ways to choose a president and a 2-person committee from 8 people."
