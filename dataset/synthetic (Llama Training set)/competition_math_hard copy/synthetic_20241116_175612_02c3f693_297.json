I'll walk through it just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, thinking out loud, exploring different strategies, making mistakes, and reflecting often to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is asking for the residue of \\( 9^{2010} \\) modulo 17. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Modular Arithmetic Familiarity:** I remember working with modular arithmetic before, especially with small numbers. Residues are usually about finding what's left after division, right?\n  \n- **Exponentiation by Squaring:** This method pops into my mind for dealing with large exponents in modular problems. But wait, is that the best approach here?\n  \n- **Fermat's Little Theorem:** I think I recall Fermat's Little Theorem being useful for primes. Hmm, maybe that could simplify things.\n\n- **Direct Computation:** I could attempt to compute \\( 9^{2010} \\mod 17 \\) directly, but that seems impractical due to the large exponent.\n\nOverall, I'm leaning towards using Fermat's Little Theorem because it deals directly with primes and exponents. But let's explore it step by step to confirm if it's the right path.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Considering Fermat's Little Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFermat's Little Theorem states that if \\( p \\) is a prime and \\( a \\) is an integer not divisible by \\( p \\), then:\n\\[ a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\]\n\nHere, \\( p = 17 \\) and \\( a = 9 \\), which is not divisible by 17. So, the theorem should apply.\n\n**Application:**\n\nAccording to the theorem:\n\\[ 9^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 17 \\]\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nSince \\( 2010 \\) is much larger than \\( 16 \\), we can reduce the exponent using modulo \\( 16 \\).\n\nBut before proceeding, let's double-check if reducing the exponent this way is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, does reducing \\( 2010 \\) by \\( 16 \\) work here? Let me think.\n\n- **Fermat's Little Theorem Application:** Yes, because \\( 9^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 17 \\), any multiple of 16 in the exponent will also be congruent to 1.\n\n- **Exponent Reduction:** So, \\( 9^{2010} \\mod 17 \\) can be reduced by finding \\( 2010 \\mod 16 \\).\n\n- **Calculation Check:** Let me calculate \\( 2010 \\mod 16 \\):\n  \\[\n  2010 \\div 16 = 125 \\text{ with a remainder of } 10\n  \\]\n  So, \\( 2010 \\mod 16 = 10 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI think this is heading in the right direction. Reducing the exponent simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Simplifying the Exponent**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, instead of calculating \\( 9^{2010} \\), we need to find \\( 9^{10} \\mod 17 \\). This seems manageable.\n\n**Strategies to Compute \\( 9^{10} \\mod 17 \\):**\n\n1. **Exponentiation by Squaring:** This method is efficient for computing large powers modulo a number.\n   \n2. **Calculate Sequentially:** Compute \\( 9^2, 9^4, \\) and so on, reducing modulo 17 at each step to keep numbers small.\n\n**Choosing a Strategy:**\n\nI'll go with **Exponentiation by Squaring** because it's systematic and reduces the number of multiplications needed. But I might also think about doing it step-by-step in case something feels off.\n\n**Applying Exponentiation by Squaring:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Calculate \\( 9^2 \\mod 17 \\):\n  \\[\n  9^2 = 81 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 81 \\mod 17 = 13\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{(Since } 81 - 4 \\times 17 = 13\\text{)}\n  \\]\n\n- **Step 2:** Calculate \\( 9^4 \\mod 17 \\):\n  \\[\n  (9^2)^2 \\equiv 13^2 = 169 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 169 \\mod 17 = 16\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{(Since } 169 - 9 \\times 17 = 16\\text{)}\n  \\]\n\n- **Step 3:** Calculate \\( 9^8 \\mod 17 \\):\n  \\[\n  (9^4)^2 \\equiv 16^2 = 256 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 256 \\mod 17 = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{(Since } 256 - 15 \\times 17 = 1\\text{)}\n  \\]\n\n**Checking the Progress:**\n\nHmm, interesting. \\( 9^8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 17 \\). This might simplify things further.\n\n**Step 4: Compute \\( 9^{10} \\mod 17 \\):**\n\nNow, \\( 9^{10} = 9^8 \\times 9^2 \\).\n\nFrom previous steps:\n\\[\n9^8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 17 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 9^2 \\equiv 13 \\mod 17\n\\]\n\\[\n9^{10} \\equiv 1 \\times 13 \\equiv 13 \\mod 17\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems to be working out. The intermediate steps align, and reducing exponents using Fermat's theorem was a smart move to simplify the problem.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore concluding, let's double-check the calculations to ensure everything is correct.\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n1. **Exponent Reduction:**\n   \\[\n   2010 \\mod 16 = 10\n   \\]\n   This was calculated correctly.\n\n2. **Exponentiation by Squaring:**\n   - \\( 9^2 = 13 \\mod 17 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - \\( 9^4 = 16 \\mod 17 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - \\( 9^8 = 1 \\mod 17 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - \\( 9^{10} = 13 \\mod 17 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Alternative Approach Check:**\n\nJust to be sure, let's think about another method:\n\n- **Sequential Multiplication:** Compute \\( 9^2, 9^3, \\) up to \\( 9^{10} \\) modulo 17 and see if we get the same result. But this would be more tedious.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI feel confident that \\( 9^{10} \\equiv 13 \\mod 17 \\) is correct. The steps make sense, and the numbers check out.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\nThus, the residue of \\( 9^{2010} \\) modulo 17 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Fermat's Little Theorem** was instrumental in reducing the exponent, making the problem much more manageable.\n- **Exponentiation by Squaring** efficiently handled the exponentiation, keeping calculations within the modulo constraints.\n- Reflecting and double-checking each step ensured accuracy, preventing potential mistakes from carrying through.\n- Exploring different strategies initially helped confirm the chosen approach was efficient and correct.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m pleased with how this unfolded, and the step-by-step approach gave a clear pathway to the solution.",
