    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I notice that the height of the ball is given by a quadratic expression in terms of time \\( t \\): \n\n\\[ h(t) = -16t^2 + 80t + 21 \\]\n\nImmediately, I recognize that this is a quadratic equation. Quadratics often represent parabolic paths, especially in projectile motion problems. \n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Vertex Form:** I remember that the maximum or minimum height of a parabola can be found at its vertex.\n- **Completing the Square:** This is a method to convert the standard form to vertex form.\n- **Quadratic Formula:** I could use this to find the vertex.\n- **Graphing:** Though not practical here, visualizing might help.\n- **Derivative Approach:** Calculus could be an option if I wanted to verify.\n\nBut before jumping into any method, let me reflect: **Do I need to know the vertex for maximum height, or is there another way?** Well, since it's a quadratic opening downwards (the coefficient of \\( t^2 \\) is negative), the vertex will give me the maximum height.\n\n**Decision:** I'll start by finding the vertex using the formula for the time at which the maximum height occurs. This seems straightforward and doesn't involve rearranging the equation much.\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Time at Maximum Height**\n\nThe time \\( t \\) at which the maximum height occurs for a quadratic \\( h(t) = at^2 + bt + c \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-b}{2a} \\]\n\nIn our equation:\n- \\( a = -16 \\)\n- \\( b = 80 \\)\n- \\( c = 21 \\) (though \\( c \\) isn\u2019t needed for this step)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-80}{2 \\times -16} = \\frac{-80}{-32} = 2.5 \\, \\text{seconds} \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, that seems reasonable. The time is positive, and it makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Maximum Height**\n\nNow that I know the maximum height occurs at \\( t = 2.5 \\) seconds, I need to plug this value back into the height equation.\n\n**Thought Process:** **I hope my calculations are correct. Let me double-check as I go.**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[ h(2.5) = -16(2.5)^2 + 80(2.5) + 21 \\]\n\nFirst, compute \\( (2.5)^2 \\):\n\n\\[ (2.5)^2 = 6.25 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by \\(-16\\):\n\n\\[ -16 \\times 6.25 = -100 \\]\n\nNext, multiply \\( 80 \\times 2.5 \\):\n\n\\[ 80 \\times 2.5 = 200 \\]\n\nAdd these together along with \\( c = 21 \\):\n\n\\[ h(2.5) = -100 + 200 + 21 = 121 \\, \\text{feet} \\]\n\n**Check:** Let's quickly verify:\n- \\(-100 + 200 = 100\\)\n- \\(100 + 21 = 121\\)\n\nThat checks out. The numbers add up correctly.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Quick Reflection:** **Does this method make sense?** Yes, finding the vertex of the parabola gives the maximum height, and the calculations seem correct.\n\n**Alternative Check:** Maybe I could graph the equation or use calculus to confirm, but since I'm getting a reasonable number and the method is sound, I\u2019ll stick with this.\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\nJust to ensure I'm on the right track, let me think about other methods:\n\n- **Completing the Square:** This could also get me the vertex form, but since I already have the formula for the vertex, it might be unnecessary.\n- **Quadratic Formula:** Not needed here since we're not solving for roots.\n- **Graphing:** Would visually confirm the vertex but isn't necessary for a numerical answer.\n\n**Conclusion:** The method I used is the most straightforward for this problem. Time spent exploring other strategies reassures me that the vertex approach is correct.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet me summarize and verify:\n\n1. **Found the time at maximum height:** \\( t = 2.5 \\) seconds\n2. **Calculated the maximum height:** \\( h(2.5) = 121 \\) feet\n3. **Checked calculations:** Addition and multiplications are correct\n4. **Reflected on the approach:** Vertex formula is appropriate for finding maximum height\n\nEverything aligns, and the answer makes sense both mathematically and contextually.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**The maximum height of the ball is \\( 121 \\) feet.**\n\n---\n\n**Natural Thinking Breakdown:**\n\n- **Initial Confusion:** At first, I considered multiple methods but quickly realized that finding the vertex time was the most direct approach.\n- **Reflection at Each Step:** After calculating the time, I paused to ensure it was reasonable before proceeding to find the height.\n- **Mistake Check:** I double-checked each arithmetic step to avoid simple calculation errors.\n- **Strategy Confirmation:** By contemplating alternative methods, I verified that my chosen approach was optimal.\n- **Human-Like Thinking:** Throughout, I allowed for re-evaluation and corrections, mimicking how a person would think through a problem naturally.\n\nThis step-by-step method, complete with reflections and checks, ensures a comprehensive and accurate solution to the problem.",

  "ground_truth": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+80t+21=-16(t^2-5t)+21\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-5/2)^2=6.25$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-5t)+21&=-16(t^2-5t+6.25-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16([t-2.5]^2-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16(t-2.5)^2+121\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2.5)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2.5)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+121=\\boxed{121}$ feet."
