I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work as I go, and adjust my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nSo, the problem states that in base \\( b \\), there are exactly **100** three-digit numbers whose digits are all distinct. We need to find out what the base \\( b \\) is.\n\nInitial Reactions:\n\n- **Base Systems:** I remember that in different bases, the digits range from 0 to \\( b-1 \\). So, in base \\( b \\), each digit can be one of those \\( b \\) possibilities.\n  \n- **Three-Digit Numbers:** Typically, a three-digit number in base \\( b \\) ranges from \\( b^2 \\) to \\( b^3 - 1 \\) in decimal. But here, we're focusing on three-digit numbers with distinct digits, which adds complexity.\n\n- **Distinct Digits:** This suggests combinatorial counting to ensure all three digits are different.\n\nAt this point, I'm brainstorming different strategies to count the distinct three-digit numbers in base \\( b \\).\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Combinatorial Approach:** Count the number of valid digit combinations where all digits are distinct.\n   \n2. **Direct Enumeration:** Try to list out the three-digit numbers in a small base to see a pattern (though this might be impractical for larger bases).\n\n3. **Equation Setup:** Set up an equation based on the total number of distinct three-digit numbers being equal to 100.\n\nHonestly, the combinatorial approach seems like the most systematic way to handle this. Direct enumeration won't be feasible for larger bases, and setting up an equation based on combinatorial counting sounds promising.\n\n### **Step 1: Combinatorial Approach to Counting Distinct Digits**\n\nLet's start with the **Combinatorial Approach**.\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **First Digit:** The first digit of a three-digit number cannot be zero (to ensure it's truly three digits). So, there are \\( b-1 \\) possible choices (digits 1 to \\( b-1 \\)).\n\n- **Second Digit:** The second digit can be any digit except the first one and zero (since zero can now be used). So, there are \\( b-1 \\) choices.\n\n- **Third Digit:** The third digit can be any digit except the first two. So, there are \\( b-2 \\) choices.\n\n#### **Calculation:**\n\nNumber of three-digit numbers with distinct digits in base \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nN(b) = (b-1) \\times (b-1) \\times (b-2)\n\\]\n\nWait, this doesn't seem right. Let me reconsider the choices:\n\n- **First Digit:** \\( b-1 \\) options (can't be zero).\n\n- **Second Digit:** \\( b-1 \\) options (can include zero now).\n\n- **Third Digit:** \\( b-2 \\) options (must be different from the first two).\n\nSo the calculation should be:\n\n\\[\nN(b) = (b-1) \\times b \\times (b-2)\n\\]\n\nBut wait, I think I've messed up. Let's revisit the logic.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\n**First Digit:** \\( b-1 \\) options (digits 1 to \\( b-1 \\)).\n\n**Second Digit:** \\( b \\) options, including zero.\n\n**Third Digit:** \\( b-2 \\) options, excluding the first two.\n\nSo the correct formula should be:\n\n\\[\nN(b) = (b-1) \\times b \\times (b-2)\n\\]\n\nDoes that make sense? Let's double-check.\n\n- **First Digit:** Can be any digit from 1 to \\( b-1 \\) \u2192 \\( b-1 \\) options.\n\n- **Second Digit:** Can be any digit from 0 to \\( b-1 \\), excluding the first digit \u2192 \\( b \\) options.\n\n- **Third Digit:** Can be any digit from 0 to \\( b-1 \\), excluding the first two digits \u2192 \\( b-2 \\) options.\n\nOkay, I think this makes more sense now. Let's proceed with this formula.\n\n### **Step 2: Set Up the Equation Based on Given Information**\n\nWe know that \\( N(b) = 100 \\):\n\n\\[\n(b-1) \\times b \\times (b-2) = 100\n\\]\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\nWe have an equation involving \\( b \\). To solve for \\( b \\), I could expand this equation and form a polynomial, but that might get messy. Instead, let's see if we can find a base \\( b \\) that satisfies this equation by trial with reasonable \\( b \\) values.\n\n### **Step 3: Trial-and-Error Approach to Find \\( b \\)**\n\nLower bases are easier to handle, so let's start testing from \\( b = 5 \\) upwards (since base 4 would only have digits 0-3, and it's impossible to have three distinct non-zero digits).\n\n#### **Testing \\( b = 5 \\):**\n\n\\[\nN(5) = (5-1) \\times 5 \\times (5-2) = 4 \\times 5 \\times 3 = 60\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Uh-oh, 60 is less than 100. So, \\( b = 5 \\) is too small.\n\n#### **Trying \\( b = 6 \\):**\n\n\\[\nN(6) = (6-1) \\times 6 \\times (6-2) = 5 \\times 6 \\times 4 = 120\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Hmm, 120 is greater than 100. So, \\( b = 6 \\) is too large.\n\n#### **Trying \\( b = 7 \\):**\n\n\\[\nN(7) = (7-1) \\times 7 \\times (7-2) = 6 \\times 7 \\times 5 = 210\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** 210 is still too large. It seems like I'm overshooting with \\( b = 7 \\).\n\n### **Step 4: Narrowing Down the Range**\n\nFrom the trials:\n\n- \\( b = 5 \\) \u2192 60\n- \\( b = 6 \\) \u2192 120\n- \\( b = 7 \\) \u2192 210\n\nThe desired number of three-digit distinct numbers is 100. So, \\( b \\) must be between 5 and 7.\n\n#### **Checking \\( b = 6 \\) Again:**\n\nEven though \\( b = 6 \\) gives 120, it's closer to 100 than \\( b = 5 \\) which gives 60. Maybe I need to refine my approach.\n\n### **Step 5: Re-examining the Combinatorial Formula**\n\nPerhaps the initial formula needs adjustment. Let's consider the constraints more carefully.\n\n#### **Reassessing the Second Digit:**\n\nIn base \\( b \\), after choosing the first digit (which can't be zero), the second digit can be any digit, including zero, except for the first digit chosen. The third digit must be different from both the first and second.\n\nSo, the correct formula should account for these constraints properly.\n\n#### **Correcting the Formula:**\n\nLet's think this through:\n\n1. **First Digit:** \\( b-1 \\) options (1 to \\( b-1 \\)).\n2. **Second Digit:** \\( b-1 \\) options (can be 0 to \\( b-1 \\), excluding the first digit).\n3. **Third Digit:** \\( b-2 \\) options (excluding the first two digits).\n\nBut, from our earlier calculation, this seems off because \\( b = 6 \\) is still too high.\n\n### **Step 6: Error Identification and Adjustment**\n\nWait, I think I might have double-counted the second digit's options. Let's correct this.\n\n#### **Re-thought Process:**\n\n- **First Digit:** \\( b-1 \\) options.\n- **Second Digit:** Can be \\( b \\) options (including zero), but one must be excluded (the digit chosen as the first).\n- **Third Digit:** Must be different from the first two, hence \\( b-2 \\) options.\n\nBut, the initial formula missed this nuance.\n\n#### **Revised Formula:**\n\nPerhaps the formula should be:\n\n\\[\nN(b) = (b-1) \\times (b-1) \\times (b-2)\n\\]\n\nLet's test this with \\( b = 6 \\):\n\n\\[\nN(6) = (6-1) \\times (6-1) \\times (6-2) = 5 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 100\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Ah, now it matches! So, the correct approach was to ensure the second digit's choices are not over-counted.\n\n### **Step 7: Confirming the Correct Base \\( b = 6 \\)**\n\nLet's double-check:\n\n- **First Digit:** 1 to 5 \u2192 5 options.\n- **Second Digit:** Any from 0 to 5, excluding the first digit \u2192 5 options.\n- **Third Digit:** Any from 0 to 5, excluding the first two digits \u2192 4 options.\n\nTotal distinct three-digit numbers in base 6:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 100\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:** The base \\( b \\) is indeed **6**.\n\n### **Final Check: Does \\( N(6) = 100 \\)?**\n\nYes, \\( N(6) = 100 \\). So our solution is consistent with the problem's requirement.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Confusion:** At first, my approach led me to think \\( b = 6 \\) was too high, but upon refining the formula, it became clear that \\( b = 6 \\) is correct.\n\n- **Importance of Reflection:** Re-examining the formula and ensuring each step's logic is sound helped identify and correct the over-counting issue.\n\n- **Value of Trial-and-Error:** Testing different \\( b \\) values narrowed down the possible ranges and guided the correct solution.\n\n- **Correcting Mistakes:** Recognizing and adjusting when something doesn't add up is crucial in problem-solving.\n\nOverall, the step-by-step reflection and adjustment led to the correct identification of base \\( b \\) as **6**.",

  "ground_truth": "To form a three-digit number in base $b$ whose digits are all distinct, we must choose a first digit, a second digit, and a third digit. We have $b-1$ choices for the first digit ($1,2,3,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$). We have $b-1$ choices for the second digit ($0,1,2,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$, with the first digit removed from our choices). We have $b-2$ choices for the third digit. So, $$(b-1)^2(b-2) = 100.$$Trial and error is arguably the most reasonable way to solve this equation! Since $100=5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4$, the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$."
