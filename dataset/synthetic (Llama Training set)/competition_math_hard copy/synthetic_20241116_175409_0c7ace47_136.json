    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies to tackle it, reflecting often, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how I'd naturally work through it.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question about finding the intersection points of two parabolas given by their equations:\n\n1. **$y = 2x^2 - 10x - 10$**\n2. **$y = x^2 - 4x + 6$**\n\nI think, \"This looks like a problem where I need to find the $x$-coordinates where these two parabolas intersect.\" It reminds me of previous problems where I set two quadratic equations equal to each other to find their points of intersection.\n\nBut I'm also thinking, \"Wait, are both parabolas opening upwards or downwards? How does that affect the number of intersection points?\" I recall that parabolas can have zero, one, or two points of intersection depending on their shapes and positions.\n\nAnother thought is, \"Maybe I can graph these parabolas to visually see where they intersect.\" However, without graphing tools at hand, I'll need to rely on algebraic methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Set the Equations Equal to Each Other:**\n   - This seems like the most straightforward approach. Since both equations equal $y$, setting them equal will give me an equation in terms of $x$.\n   \n2. **Graphing the Parabolas:**\n   - If I had graphing software, this could provide a visual solution. But since that's not feasible here, I'll stick to algebra.\n\n3. **Substitution or Elimination:**\n   - These methods are typically used for systems of linear equations. Maybe I can adapt them for quadratics by manipulating the equations.\n\n4. **Completing the Square:**\n   - This could help in rewriting the parabolas in vertex form, making it easier to analyze their positions.\n\n5. **Checking for Vertex Overlap:**\n   - If the vertices of the parabolas coincide, they might touch at a single point.\n\nI think the **first strategy\u2014setting the equations equal to each other**\u2014is the most direct. But I'll keep the other methods in mind in case I run into difficulties.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Set the Equations Equal to Each Other**\n\nSo, let's start by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 10x - 10 = x^2 - 4x + 6\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- This should give me a single equation in terms of $x$. If I solve for $x$, I can find the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Subtract $x^2$ from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - x^2 - 10x - 10 = -4x + 6\n\\]\n\n- Simplify:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x - 10 = -4x + 6\n\\]\n\n- Add $4x$ and subtract $6$ from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + 4x - 10 - 6 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x - 16 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Okay, I've got a quadratic equation: \\( x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 \\).\n- This seems correct because I set the two parabolas equal to each other and simplified accordingly.\n- **Check:** Each step involved basic algebra\u2014subtraction and addition\u2014so I feel confident about this equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solve the Quadratic Equation**\n\nNow, I need to solve the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 \\) to find the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I know there are various methods to solve quadratics: factoring, using the quadratic formula, or completing the square.\n- **Factoring:** Let's see if this trinomial can be factored easily.\n- If factoring doesn't work, I'll resort to the quadratic formula.\n\n**Attempt to Factor:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x - 16 = (x - a)(x + b)\n\\]\n\nBut wait, **wait**\u2014I remember that when factoring, the product of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) should equal \\(-16\\) and the sum should equal \\(-6\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Based on that, \\( a = 8 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\) seem to fit because:\n  \n  \\[\n  8 \\times (-2) = -16 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 8 + (-2) = 6\n  \\]\n\n- So, the factoring looks like:\n\n\\[\n(x - 8)(x + 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Setting each factor to zero:\n\n\\[\nx - 8 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 8\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- I think I've factored it correctly because the product and sum conditions are met.\n- **Quick Check:** Multiplying \\( (x - 8)(x + 2) \\) gives back the original quadratic equation.\n\n**Alternative Method: Quadratic Formula**\n\nJust to be sure, let's apply the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -6 \\), \\( c = -16 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nx = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-16)}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 64}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{6 \\pm 10}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both methods\u2014factoring and the quadratic formula\u2014yield the same $x$-coordinates: \\( x = 8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\).\n- This consistency reassures me that the solutions are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Find the Corresponding $y$-Coordinates**\n\nNow that I have the $x$-coordinates, I need to find the corresponding $y$-coordinates to identify the exact points of intersection.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I can substitute each $x$-value back into either of the original equations since at the points of intersection, both equations will give the same $y$-value.\n- To avoid errors, I'll check both $y$-equations with each $x$-value.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **For \\( x = 8 \\):**\n   - **Equation 1:** \n\n   \\[\n   y = 2(8)^2 - 10(8) - 10 = 2(64) - 80 - 10 = 128 - 80 - 10 = 38\n   \\]\n   \n   - **Equation 2:**\n\n   \\[\n   y = (8)^2 - 4(8) + 6 = 64 - 32 + 6 = 38\n   \\]\n\n   **Check:**\n   - Both equations yield \\( y = 38 \\). This confirms the point \\( (8, 38) \\).\n\n2. **For \\( x = -2 \\):**\n   - **Equation 1:**\n\n   \\[\n   y = 2(-2)^2 - 10(-2) - 10 = 2(4) + 20 - 10 = 8 + 20 - 10 = 18\n   \\]\n\n   - **Equation 2:**\n\n   \\[\n   y = (-2)^2 - 4(-2) + 6 = 4 + 8 + 6 = 18\n   \\]\n\n   **Check:**\n   - Both equations yield \\( y = 18 \\). This confirms the point \\( (-2, 18) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- It's reassuring that both $y$-coordinates match for each $x$-value. This consistency confirms that the intersection points are correctly identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: List the Points in Order of Increasing $x$-Coordinate**\n\nFinally, I need to present the intersection points in order of their $x$-coordinates, separated by semicolons.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I've found two intersection points: \\( (8, 38) \\) and \\( (-2, 18) \\).\n- To list them in order of increasing $x$, I'll sort by the $x$-coordinates.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- The point with the smaller $x$-coordinate is \\( (-2, 18) \\).\n- The point with the larger $x$-coordinate is \\( (8, 38) \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n(-2, 18); \\quad (8, 38)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Listing the points this way aligns with the request in the question. Everything seems in order.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let's quickly review the entire process:\n\n1. **Setting the Equations Equal:** Correctly transformed the problem into a single quadratic equation.\n  \n2. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** \n   - Factored the equation successfully.\n   - Verified solutions using the quadratic formula.\n\n3. **Finding $y$-Coordinates:** \n   - Substituted $x$-values back into the original equations.\n   - Consistent $y$-values confirmed the intersection points.\n\n4. **Listing the Points Correctly:** \n   - Sorted by increasing $x$-coordinate.\n   - Presented in the required format.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- The entire approach feels logical and sequential.\n- The consistency between different methods and checks along the way reassures me that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming, exploring multiple strategies, and reflecting at each step, I've determined that the parabolas intersect at the points:\n\n\\[\n(-2, 18); \\quad (8, 38)\n\\]\n\nBy continuously checking and validating each part of the process, I've ensured the accuracy of the solution. This step-by-step approach not only led me to the correct answer but also provided confidence in its correctness.",

  "ground_truth": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-10x-10=x^2-4x+6$. Combine like terms to get $x^2-6x=16$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{6}{2}\\right)^2=9$ to both sides, giving $(x-3)^2=16+9=25$.\n\nSo we have $x-3=\\pm5$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $8$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2,18)}$ and $\\boxed{(8,38)}$."
