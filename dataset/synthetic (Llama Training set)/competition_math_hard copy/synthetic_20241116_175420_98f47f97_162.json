I'll start by brainstorming possible strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}+\\frac{9}{4}}\n\\]  \nMy initial reaction is to recognize that this involves both fractions and a square root. It reminds me of simplifying expressions under a square root, maybe similar to the Pythagorean theorem. But I'm not entirely sure where to start yet.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Common Denominator:** Maybe combine the fractions under the square root by finding a common denominator.\n  2. **Simplify Each Fraction First:** Simplify \\(\\frac{16}{25}\\) and \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) individually before adding them.\n  3. **Decimal Approximation:** Convert everything to decimals to get a rough idea of the answer.\n  4. **Square Root Properties:** Use properties of square roots to simplify the expression.\n\nI'm leaning towards the **Common Denominator** approach because combining the fractions seems straightforward, but I'm not entirely sure if it's the most efficient method. Let's explore it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Common Denominator Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, let's try to find a common denominator for \\(\\frac{16}{25}\\) and \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\). This should allow me to add the fractions easily.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Finding Common Denominator:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Denominators are } 25 \\text{ and } 4. \n  \\]\n  - **Multiples of 25:** 25, 50, 75, 100, ...\n  - **Multiples of 4:** 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...\n\n  The **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** is 100.\n\n- **Adjusting Fractions:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{25} \\times \\frac{4}{4} = \\frac{64}{100}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{9}{4} \\times \\frac{25}{25} = \\frac{225}{100}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Adding the Fractions:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{64}{100} + \\frac{225}{100} = \\frac{289}{100}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute. Adding the fractions seems straightforward, but does this really simplify the square root effectively? Let me think. The square root of \\(\\frac{289}{100}\\) is \\(\\frac{17}{10}\\), which looks clean. But is there a more direct method?\n\nMaybe there's a better way to handle the square root without going through finding a common denominator. Let's brainstorm another approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering Simplifying Each Fraction First**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nPerhaps simplifying each fraction before adding them under the square root would be more efficient.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Simplify \\(\\frac{16}{25}\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{25} = \\frac{4^2}{5^2} = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplify \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{3^2}{2^2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2\n  \\]\n  \n**Adding under the Square Root:**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks familiar, like the Pythagorean theorem. Maybe I can apply the formula \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) here. Let me continue with this approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem Concept**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince we have squares of fractions added together, it resembles calculating the hypotenuse in a right triangle.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Recognizing the Formula:**\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = c\n  \\]\n  where \\(a = \\frac{4}{5}\\) and \\(b = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\n- **Calculating \\(c\\):**\n  \\[\n  c = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2}\n  \\]\n  \n  Let's compute each square:\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16}{25}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4}\n  \\]\n  \n  Now add them:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{25} + \\frac{9}{4}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, we're back to adding the fractions. This reinforces the idea that finding a common denominator initially might still be a valid approach. But since I already tried that and it worked, perhaps this method is just validating it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Checking the Answer from Previous Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's verify if the answer from the Common Denominator approach is correct.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Recall the Answer:**\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{\\frac{289}{100}} = \\frac{17}{10}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Checking the Work:**\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{17}{10}\\right)^2 = \\frac{289}{100}\n  \\]\n  \n  Does this match the sum under the square root?\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{25} + \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{289}{100}\n  \\]\n  \n  Yes, it checks out.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe Common Denominator method worked correctly. However, exploring different strategies helped reinforce the validity of the solution. It's always good to brainstorm multiple approaches to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought**\n\nBy starting with brainstorming different strategies and exploring the Common Denominator method, I was able to arrive at the correct answer. Reflecting frequently and checking each step ensured that the solution was accurate. Initially, considering simplifying each fraction first led me back to recognizing the Pythagorean theorem, which aligned with the Common Denominator approach.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}+\\frac{9}{4}} = \\frac{17}{10}\n\\]\n\nThis process highlights the importance of thinking through various strategies, reflecting on each step, and being open to adjusting the approach to arrive at a correct and efficient solution.",
