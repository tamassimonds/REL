    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, mimicking human thought processes with brainstorming, reflection, and frequent checks. I'll explore different strategies, reflect on their validity, and adjust as needed, just like a person would naturally tackle a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:  \n*Find \\(a + b + c\\) if the graph of the equation \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) is a parabola with vertex \\((5, 3)\\), vertical axis of symmetry, and contains the point \\((2, 0)\\).*\n\nHmm, this looks like a standard quadratic equation problem. I remember from previous problems that the vertex form of a parabola is particularly useful when dealing with vertex information. Also, since we're given a specific point on the parabola, we can set up equations to solve for the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\nBut then I think: *Wait, I need to find \\(a + b + c\\), not the individual coefficients necessarily. Maybe there's a more direct way to find that sum once I have the coefficients.*\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use Vertex Form of a Quadratic:** Since we're given the vertex, converting the standard form to vertex form might simplify things.\n  \n2. **Set Up System of Equations:** Given the vertex and a point on the parabola, I can create a system of equations to solve for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n3. **Check Symmetry:** The vertical axis of symmetry suggests the parabola opens either upwards or downwards, which might help in confirming the signs of coefficients once I have them.\n\nLet's start by exploring the **Vertex Form** approach, as having the vertex directly given is a strong clue to use this method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Convert to Vertex Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI know that the vertex form of a quadratic equation is:  \n\\[ y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\]  \nwhere \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex. Since we're given the vertex \\((5, 3)\\), I can plug these into the vertex form.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems straightforward. By substituting the vertex, I'll have a more personalized equation that should align with the given point \\((2, 0)\\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \nPlugging in the vertex:  \n\\[ y = a(x - 5)^2 + 3 \\]  \n\n**Check:**  \n*Does this make sense?*  \nYes, the vertex is correctly represented, and since we're given a point on the parabola, this form should help me find \\(a\\) by substituting \\(x = 2\\), \\(y = 0\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substitute the Given Point**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's use the point \\((2, 0)\\) that lies on the parabola to find \\(a\\). Substituting \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 0\\) into the vertex form should give me an equation to solve for \\(a\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis should work because if \\((2, 0)\\) is on the parabola, it must satisfy the equation.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nSubstituting into the vertex form:  \n\\[ 0 = a(2 - 5)^2 + 3 \\]  \n\\[ 0 = a(3)^2 + 3 \\]  \n\\[ 0 = 9a + 3 \\]  \n\n**Check:**  \n*Does this equation make sense?*  \nYes, it's a simple linear equation. Solving for \\(a\\) should give me its value.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solving:**  \n\\[ 9a + 3 = 0 \\]  \n\\[ 9a = -3 \\]  \n\\[ a = -\\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n*Does the value of \\(a\\) seem reasonable?*  \nYes, \\(a = -\\frac{1}{3}\\) indicates the parabola opens downwards, which aligns with the vertical axis of symmetry and the given vertex.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Expand the Vertex Form to Find \\(b\\) and \\(c\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have \\(a = -\\frac{1}{3}\\), I can expand the vertex form back to the standard form \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) to identify \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis should give me the quadratic in standard form, allowing me to directly compare coefficients to find \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \nStarting with the vertex form:  \n\\[ y = -\\frac{1}{3}(x - 5)^2 + 3 \\]  \nExpand \\((x - 5)^2\\):  \n\\[ = -\\frac{1}{3}(x^2 - 10x + 25) + 3 \\]  \nDistribute \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\):  \n\\[ = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{25}{3} + 3 \\]  \n\\[ = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{25}{3} + \\frac{9}{3} \\]  \n\\[ = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{16}{3} \\]\n\n**Check:**  \n*Is the expansion done correctly?*  \nLet me quickly verify by recalling the steps:  \n- Squaring \\((x - 5)\\) gives \\(x^2 - 10x + 25\\).  \n- Multiplying by \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\) should lead to \\(-\\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{25}{3}\\).  \n- Adding 3 (or \\(\\frac{9}{3}\\)) adjusts the constant term correctly.\n\n*Everything checks out. The expansion seems accurate.*\n\n**Resulting Equation:**  \n\\[ y = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{16}{3} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow I can directly see the coefficients \\(a = -\\frac{1}{3}\\), \\(b = \\frac{10}{3}\\), and \\(c = -\\frac{16}{3}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate \\(a + b + c\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWith all coefficients identified, summing them up should give me the required \\(a + b + c\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis is a straightforward addition. Just to be sure, I'll add them step by step to avoid any mistakes.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ a + b + c = -\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{16}{3} \\]  \n\n**Step-by-Step Addition:**  \n1. **Combine \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):**  \n   \\[ \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{16}{3} = -\\frac{6}{3} = -2 \\]  \n   \n2. **Now add \\(a\\):**  \n   \\[ -\\frac{1}{3} + (-2) = -\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{6}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\]\n\n**Check:**  \n*Does the sum make sense?*  \nLet me reflect:  \n- Adding a negative fraction and a negative whole number aligns with the expected direction of the sum.\n- The final result, \\(-\\frac{7}{3}\\), seems reasonable given the coefficients.\n\n*Everything checks out. The calculation is correct.*\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, let's double-check each step to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Vertex Form Conversion:** Correctly applied the vertex to the quadratic form.\n- **Point Substitution:** Successfully found \\(a\\) by using the given point.\n- **Expansion:** Accurate transformation from vertex to standard form, identifying all coefficients.\n- **Sum Calculation:** Correctly summed up \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[ a + b + c = -\\frac{7}{3} \\]\n\n**Final Check:**  \n*Does the answer make sense in the context of the problem?*  \nAbsolutely. The negative sum of coefficients aligns with the downward-opening parabola having its vertex at \\((5, 3)\\).\n\n*Everything seems to be in order. The approach was correct, and the answer is consistent with the given conditions of the parabola.*\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully analyzing the problem, selecting an appropriate strategy (using the vertex form), and meticulously checking each step, we arrived at the final answer:  \n\\[ a + b + c = -\\frac{7}{3} \\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach ensured that even minor details were attended to, leading to a reliable and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the axis of symmetry is vertical and the vertex is $(5,3)$, the parabola may also be written as  \\[y=a(x-5)^2+3\\]for some value of $a$.  Plugging the point $(2,0)$ into this equation gives  \\[0=a(2-5)^2+3=9a+3.\\]This tells us $a=-\\frac13$.\n\nOur equation is  \\[y=-\\frac13(x-5)^2+3.\\]Putting it $y=ax^2+bx+c$ form requires expanding the square, so we get  \\[y=-\\frac13(x^2-10x+25)+3={-\\frac13 x^2+\\frac{10}{3}x-\\frac{16}3}.\\]Therefore, $a+b+c = \\boxed{-\\frac73}$."
