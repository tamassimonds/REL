    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, thinking through it as naturally as possible \u2013 brainstorming, reflecting, and checking along the way, just like a human would.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first glance at the question, it mentions finding the area of a triangle formed by the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve \\(y = (x - 3)^2(x + 2)\\). \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Understanding Intercepts:** \n  - Okay, I know that the $x$-intercepts are points where \\(y = 0\\), and the $y$-intercepts are where \\(x = 0\\).\n  \n- **Identifying the Curve:**\n  - The given equation is a quadratic (specifically, a polynomial of degree 3 due to the expanded terms), so I expect a parabolic shape, but with potentially more complexity because it's cubed.\n  \n- **Shape of the Triangle:**\n  - The triangle\u2019s vertices will likely be at the intercepts. I remember that the area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Find the $x$ and $y$ intercepts directly.**\n  2. **Plot the curve to visualize (though not practical here).**\n  3. **Use the formula for the area of a triangle with known vertices.**\n  \n**Wait a moment...**\n\n- Before proceeding, I realize I need to confirm if finding intercepts directly will give me the correct vertices for the triangle. The intercepts should lie on the axes, but I must ensure that only those relevant to the triangle are considered.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the $x$-intercepts**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the $x$-intercepts, I need to set \\(y = 0\\) in the given equation.\n- This means solving \\( (x - 3)^2(x + 2) = 0 \\).\n  \n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Setting the equation to zero:**\n   \\[\n   (x - 3)^2(x + 2) = 0\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Solving for \\(x\\):**\n   - \\( (x - 3)^2 = 0 \\) \u2794 \\( x = 3 \\) (double root)\n   - \\( x + 2 = 0 \\) \u2794 \\( x = -2 \\)\n   \n3. **$x$-intercepts found:**\n   - \\( (3, 0) \\) and \\( (-2, 0) \\)\n   \n**Checking:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** \n  - Yes, setting \\(y = 0\\) should give me points on the $x$-axis, and I have two distinct points: one at \\(x = 3\\) and another at \\(x = -2\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the $y$-intercept**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, to find the $y$-intercept, I need to set \\(x = 0\\) in the given equation.\n- This will give me the point where the curve crosses the $y$-axis.\n  \n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Setting \\(x = 0\\):**\n   \\[\n   y = (0 - 3)^2(0 + 2) = 9 \\times 2 = 18\n   \\]\n   \n2. **$y$-intercept found:**\n   - \\( (0, 18) \\)\n   \n**Checking:**\n\n- **Is this correct?**\n  - Yes, by substituting \\(x = 0\\) into the equation, I get \\(y = 18\\), which is a point on the $y$-axis.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying the Triangle\u2019s Vertices**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Vertices of the Triangle:**\n  - The triangle is formed by the $x$-intercepts \\( (3, 0) \\) and \\( (-2, 0) \\), and the $y$-intercept \\( (0, 18) \\).\n  \n- **Does this align with my understanding?**\n  - Yes, it makes sense that the intercepts on the axes would form the vertices of the triangle.\n\n**Possible Insight:**\n\n- **Wait, could there be other intercepts?**\n  - I recall that for polynomials, typically only one $y$-intercept exists, but multiple $x$-intercepts can. Here, I have all necessary points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Area of the Triangle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- With the three vertices identified, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n  \\]\n  \n- **Vertices:**\n  - \\( (3, 0) \\) \u2794 \\( (x_1, y_1) \\)\n  - \\( (-2, 0) \\) \u2794 \\( (x_2, y_2) \\)\n  - \\( (0, 18) \\) \u2794 \\( (x_3, y_3) \\)\n  \n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Plugging in the values:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 3(0 - 18) + (-2)(18 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) \\right|\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Simplifying the expression:**\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 3 \\times -18 + (-2) \\times 18 + 0 \\right|\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| -54 -36 \\right|\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 90 = 45\n   \\]\n   \n**Checking:**\n\n- **Does the area make sense?**\n  - An area of 45 square units seems reasonable given the intercepts' coordinates.\n  \n- **Quick Verification:**\n  - The base of the triangle lies along the $x$-axis from \\(x = -2\\) to \\(x = 3\\), a length of 5 units.\n  - The height is the $y$-intercept at \\(y = 18\\).\n  - Area \\( = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 18 = 45\\), which matches.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this confirm my previous calculation?**\n  - Yes, both methods (general area formula and base-height approach) yield the same area.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Checking Approach: Base-Height Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Brainstorming Another Way:**\n  - Instead of using the vertex formula, I can think of the triangle's base and height directly.\n  - **Base:** Distance between \\(x = -2\\) and \\(x = 3\\) \u2794 Length = \\(3 - (-2) = 5\\) units.\n  - **Height:** Given by the $y$-intercept at \\(y = 18\\) units.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 18 = 45\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- **Does this align with my earlier result?**\n  - Yes, both methods confirm the area as 45 square units.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is there any discrepancy?**\n  - No, both approaches consistently lead to the same area, validating the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies Yielded the Same Result:**\n  - Whether using the vertex formula for the area of a triangle or the base-height method, the area calculates to be 45 square units.\n  \n- **Ensured Accuracy Through Verification:**\n  - By cross-checking with an alternative method, I confirmed the correctness of the initial calculation.\n  \n- **Was There Any Uncertainty?**\n  - Initially, I paused to ensure I correctly identified the vertices and considered all necessary intercepts, which reassured me of the approach's validity.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{45}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Does the final answer make sense?**\n  - An area of 45 square units aligns with the given intercepts' coordinates and the properties of triangles.\n  \n- **Is there anything more to explore?**\n  - At this point, I'm confident in the solution. Exploring beyond isn't necessary unless additional constraints or questions were provided.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step approach, full of brainstorming, checking, and reflecting, ensures a thorough and human-like problem-solving process, leading to a reliable and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5\\cdot 18=\\boxed{45}$."
