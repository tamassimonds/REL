I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let\u2019s see where this journey takes us!\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts: Exploring the Problem**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, it says:\n\n*The inhabitants of the island of Jumble use the standard Kobish alphabet ($20$ letters, A through T). Each word in their language is $4$ letters or less, and for some reason, they insist that all words contain the letter A at least once. How many words are possible?*\n\nInitial reactions:\n\n- **Understanding the Alphabet:** Okay, there are 20 letters in total, and each word can be up to 4 letters long.\n- **Requirement of Letter A:** Every word must include the letter A at least once. This is a key constraint.\n- **Word Lengths:** Words can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 letters long. \n\nThis reminds me of problems where we deal with combinations and permutations but with an added constraint (the presence of letter A).\n\n---\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Enumeration Approach:**\n   - Calculate the total number of possible words without any constraints.\n   - Subtract the number of words that **do not** contain the letter A.\n\n   This seems like a viable approach to ensure all words contain A by removing the unwanted cases.\n\n2. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n   - Use this principle to count the number of valid words by considering overlapping sets where A is present.\n\n   I recall that this method can be complex but might be necessary to avoid double-counting.\n\n3. **Recursion or Dynamic Programming:**\n   - Think about building words step by step, ensuring A is included.\n\n   This feels more advanced and might complicate things unnecessarily for a problem of this size.\n\n4. **Generating Functions:**\n   - Use generating functions to model the constraints.\n\n   This is often used in combinatorial problems but might be overkill here.\n\nAfter reflecting, the **Direct Enumeration Approach** seems the most straightforward. Let\u2019s go with that and see how it unfolds.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Possible Words Without Constraints**\n\nFirst, let\u2019s find out how many words can be formed with the given alphabet without worrying about the letter A.\n\n- **Word Length 1:** Each letter can be any of the 20 letters.\n  \\[\n  20^1 = 20\n  \\]\n\n- **Word Length 2:** Each position can be filled by any of the 20 letters.\n  \\[\n  20^2 = 400\n  \\]\n\n- **Word Length 3:** Similarly,\n  \\[\n  20^3 = 8,000\n  \\]\n\n- **Word Length 4:** \n  \\[\n  20^4 = 160,000\n  \\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n20 + 400 + 8,000 + 160,000 = 168,420\n\\]\n\nSo, **Total Possible Words Without Constraints = 168,420**.\n\n**Reflection: Does This Make Sense?**\n\nAt first glance, the number seems reasonable for a total count across all word lengths. But let\u2019s be cautious because this includes words that **don\u2019t** have the letter A, which we need to exclude.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Total Words That Do Not Contain A**\n\nNow, we need to find the number of words that **do not** include the letter A at all. This will help us subtract from the total and find the desired count.\n\n- **Total Letters Excluding A:** 19 letters (B through T).\n\n- **Word Length 1 Without A:**\n  \\[\n  19^1 = 19\n  \\]\n\n- **Word Length 2 Without A:**\n  \\[\n  19^2 = 361\n  \\]\n\n- **Word Length 3 Without A:**\n  \\[\n  19^3 = 6,859\n  \\]\n\n- **Word Length 4 Without A:**\n  \\[\n  19^4 = 130,321\n  \\]\n\nAdding these:\n\\[\n19 + 361 + 6,859 + 130,321 = 137,560\n\\]\n\n**Total Words Without A = 137,560**.\n\n**Reflection: Quick Check**\n\nWait, the number seems quite large. Is it possible that I miscalculated? Let\u2019s double-check the calculations for \\(19^n\\):\n\n- \\(19^1 = 19\\)\n- \\(19^2 = 361\\)\n- \\(19^3 = 6,859\\)\n- \\(19^4 = 130,321\\)\n\nYes, the calculations are correct. So, **Total Words Without A = 137,560**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Total Words That Contain A**\n\nTo find the number of words that contain the letter A, we subtract the total words without A from the total possible words:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Words with A} = \\text{Total Possible Words} - \\text{Total Words Without A}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total Words with A} = 168,420 - 137,560 = 30,860\n\\]\n\nSo, **Total Words Containing A = 30,860**.\n\n**Reflection: Does This Number Make Sense?**\n\n30,860 seems more reasonable compared to 168,420. It\u2019s a smaller subset, which aligns with our expectation since we\u2019re filtering out words that lack the letter A.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Approach Using Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let\u2019s briefly consider the **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**. This method counts the total by considering all possible cases and subtracting overlapping ones.\n\nHowever, since we\u2019ve already removed unwanted cases by subtracting the number of words without A from the total, and the calculations seem consistent, it appears that our **Direct Enumeration Approach** is valid here.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Total Words Calculated:** 168,420\n- **Words Without A:** 137,560\n- **Words With A:** 30,860\n\nSum verification:\n\\[\n137,560 + 30,860 = 168,420\n\\]\nEverything adds up correctly, confirming the accuracy of our approach.\n\n---\n\n**Brainstorming Again: Is There a More Efficient Way?**\n\nWhile the **Direct Enumeration Approach** worked well, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a more efficient method, especially if the alphabet size or word lengths were larger.\n\nOne possible alternative could be to calculate the probability of a word containing A and multiply it by the total number of words. However, given the simplicity of our current method and the checks confirming its correctness, it might be unnecessary to complicate things here.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully exploring different strategies and verifying each step, I\u2019m confident that the number of words containing the letter A at least once is **30,860**.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of the steps taken:\n\n1. **Calculated Total Possible Words Without Constraints:** 168,420\n2. **Calculated Total Words That Do Not Contain A:** 137,560\n3. **Determined Total Words That Contain A:** 30,860\n4. **Verified the Approach and Sum Check:** All numbers consistent and correct.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30{,}860} \\]\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure to reflect often, check my calculations, and adjust my approach whenever something felt off. This step-by-step exploration ensured that the final answer is accurate and reliable.",

  "ground_truth": "We consider the opposite; we try to find the number of words that do not contain A, and then subtract it from the total possible number of words. So we have a few cases to consider:\n\n$\\bullet$  One letter words: There is only $1$ one-letter word that contains A, that's A.\n\n$\\bullet$  Two letter words: There are $19\\times19=361$ words that do not contain A. There is a total of $20\\times20=400$ words, so we have $400-361=39$ words that satisfy the condition.\n\n$\\bullet$  Three letter words: There are $19\\times19\\times19=6859$ words without A, and there are $20^{3}=8000$ words available. So there are $8000-6859=1141$ words that satisfy the condition.\n\n$\\bullet$  Four letter words: Using the same idea as above, we have $20^{4}-19^{4}=29679$ words satisfying the requirement.\n\nSo this gives a total of $1+39+1141+29679=\\boxed{30860}$ words."
