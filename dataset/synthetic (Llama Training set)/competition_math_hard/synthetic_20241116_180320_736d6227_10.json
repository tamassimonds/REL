    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, thinking through them, checking if they make sense, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's treat this like a real human problem-solving session, complete with initial confusion, reflections, and those \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is:\n\n\\[ (\\log_{10} x)^2 - \\log_{10}(x^2) = 48, \\]\n\nwith the condition \\( x < 1 \\). We need to find:\n\n\\[ (\\log_{10} x)^3 - \\log_{10}(x^3). \\]\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Logarithm Properties:** Immediately, I think about properties of logarithms. Maybe I can use that to simplify the expressions.\n- **Quadratic Equation:** The given equation looks quadratic in terms of \\( \\log_{10} x \\). Perhaps setting \\( y = \\log_{10} x \\) could help.\n- **Connection Between Logs:** The expressions seem related to each other through logarithmic identities. Perhaps there's a pattern or relationship I can exploit.\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start, but these thoughts are swirling around. Let me explore each one to see which path looks promising.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Using Logarithm Properties**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nLogarithmic identities might simplify the expression. Recall:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(x^2) = 2 \\log_{10} x \\]\n\nSo, the given equation becomes:\n\n\\[ (\\log_{10} x)^2 - 2 \\log_{10} x = 48 \\]\n\nThis looks like a quadratic equation in terms of \\( \\log_{10} x \\). Maybe I can set it up in standard form and solve for \\( \\log_{10} x \\).\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet me set:\n\n\\[ y = \\log_{10} x \\]\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ y^2 - 2y - 48 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a standard quadratic equation. I can use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{-b \u00b1 \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nBut before I dive into calculations, **wait**\u2014I need to check if this makes sense given the condition \\( x < 1 \\). Recall that:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10} x < 0 \\]\n\nbecause logarithms of numbers less than 1 are negative. Let me reflect if this approach respects that.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUsing the quadratic formula should give me values for \\( y \\), and I can then check which one is less than zero. If both solutions are negative, that aligns with \\( x < 1 \\).\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\nAlright, let's compute \\( y \\) using the quadratic formula:\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -2 \\)\n- \\( c = -48 \\)\n\nPlugging into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{2 \u00b1 \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-48)}}{2 \\times 1} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{2 \u00b1 \\sqrt{4 + 192}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{2 \u00b1 \\sqrt{196}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{2 \u00b1 14}{2} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = \\frac{-12}{2} = -6 \\]\n\n**Checking Validity:**\n\n- \\( y = 8 \\): This is positive, which would imply \\( x = 10^8 = 100,000,000 \\). But wait, that's not less than 1\u2014this contradicts our condition \\( x < 1 \\).\n- \\( y = -6 \\): This is negative, implying \\( x = 10^{-6} = 0.000001 \\), which satisfies \\( x < 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly \\( y = -6 \\) is valid. So, \\( \\log_{10} x = -6 \\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense because \\( 10^{-6} < 1 \\). The positive solution is extraneous in this context, aligning with our condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking Work:**\n\nQuick check:\n\n- \\( \\log_{10} x = -6 \\) implies \\( x = 10^{-6} = 0.000001 \\), which is indeed less than 1.\n- Substituting \\( y = -6 \\) back into the original equation:\n\n\\[ (-6)^2 - 2(-6) = 36 + 12 = 48 \\]\n\nThis matches the given equation, so the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Moving to the Next Part: Calculating \\( (\\log_{10} x)^3 - \\log_{10}(x^3) \\)**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nNow that I know \\( \\log_{10} x = -6 \\), I can substitute this value into the expression:\n\n\\[ (\\log_{10} x)^3 - \\log_{10}(x^3) \\]\n\nBut before proceeding, let me recall another logarithmic identity:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(x^3) = 3 \\log_{10} x \\]\n\nThis might simplify things. Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[ (\\log_{10} x)^3 - 3 \\log_{10} x \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks cleaner. I just need to calculate \\( (\\log_{10} x)^3 \\) and subtract \\( 3 \\log_{10} x \\) from it. Let's plug in \\( \\log_{10} x = -6 \\).\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\nCalculating \\( (\\log_{10} x)^3 \\):\n\n\\[ (-6)^3 = -216 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 3 \\log_{10} x \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times (-6) = -18 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ (\\log_{10} x)^3 - 3 \\log_{10} x = -216 - (-18) \\]\n\n\\[ = -216 + 18 \\]\n\n\\[ = -198 \\]\n\n**Checking Validity:**\n\nDoes this seem reasonable? Let's think about it:\n\n- The expression involves subtracting a negative number from a larger negative number, which makes the result less negative.\n- Given \\( \\log_{10} x = -6 \\), the calculations align logically.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThe calculations check out. The negative signs are handled correctly, and the final answer makes sense in the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the step-by-step exploration and calculation:\n\n\\[ (\\log_{10} x)^3 - \\log_{10}(x^3) = \\boxed{-198} \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy starting with recognizing logarithmic properties and setting up the equation, I was able to solve for \\( \\log_{10} x \\) accurately. Checking each step ensured that the condition \\( x < 1 \\) was met. Finally, substituting the value into the desired expression and carefully handling the calculations led to the correct answer. Throughout the process, reflecting and verifying each step helped catch potential errors and confirm the solution's validity.",
