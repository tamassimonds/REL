    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and brainstorm a variety of strategies to tackle it. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different approaches, reflecting on their validity, and adjusting as needed, just like I would naturally think through it.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, it reminds me of problems involving **simple interest** and **equations of equality** that I've encountered before. The goal is to determine in how many days both Darren and Fergie will owe the same amount, given that they haven't made any repayments.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Simple Interest Familiarity:** I've dealt with simple interest calculations before, where interest accrues over time based on a fixed percentage. So, calculating the total amount owed over time seems straightforward.\n\n- **Equal Amounts Over Time:** Setting their debts equal to each other after a certain number of days is similar to solving for an unknown in an equation. This suggests that I might need to set up an equation relating the two amounts.\n\n- **Daily Interest Component:** Since the interest is calculated daily, I need to ensure that my time variable (let's call it \\(d\\)) is correctly integrated into the calculations.\n\nBut I\u2019m not entirely sure if this is the most efficient path. Maybe there\u2019s a more intuitive way to approach it. Let\u2019s brainstorm a bit.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Set Up Equations for Both Debts:**\n   - Calculate the total amount owed by Darren and Fergie after \\(d\\) days.\n   - Set the two amounts equal to each other and solve for \\(d\\).\n\n   **Pros:** Direct and straightforward since it's like solving a linear equation.\n   \n   **Cons:** Might be prone to arithmetic errors if not carefully executed.\n\n2. **Calculate when the Interest Amounts are Equal:**\n   - Since both have different principal amounts and interest rates, maybe the point where the interest accrued by both is the same could determine when their total debts are equal.\n\n   **Pros:** It could simplify the problem by focusing on the interest component first.\n\n   **Cons:** This might complicate things because the principal amounts are different, so it's not immediately clear if this would work.\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Visualize both debts as linear functions of time and find their intersection point.\n\n   **Pros:** Intuitive and can provide a visual understanding of the solution.\n\n   **Cons:** Not practical without graphing tools, especially for a simple text-based problem.\n\n4. **Use Proportionality:**\n   - Since both debts accrue interest daily, perhaps setting the ratio of their principal amounts equal to the ratio of their interest rates could lead to a solution.\n\n   **Pros:** This might simplify the relationship between the two debts.\n\n   **Cons:** This approach isn't immediately clear to me, so I might need to think it through more.\n\n**Conclusion of Brainstorming:**\n\nThe first strategy\u2014setting up equations for both debts and equating them\u2014seems the most straightforward and aligned with what I usually do for such problems. The graphical approach is appealing for visualization but impractical here. The proportionality method is intriguing but feels a bit abstract at this point. \n\n**Let\u2019s Go with the First Strategy** and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Variables**\n\nBefore proceeding, let's clearly define what's given:\n\n- **Darren's Loan:**\n  - Principal: \\( P_D = 100 \\) clams\n  - Interest Rate: \\( r_D = 10\\% \\) per day\n\n- **Fergie's Loan:**\n  - Principal: \\( P_F = 150 \\) clams\n  - Interest Rate: \\( r_F = 5\\% \\) per day\n\n- **Time:** \\( d \\) days (this is what we need to find)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHaving the variables clearly defined ensures that I won't mix things up later. It also helps in setting up the equations correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Write the Equations for Total Amounts Owed**\n\nNow, let\u2019s write the equations for the total amount owed by each borrower after \\(d\\) days.\n\n- **Total Amount Owed by Darren (\\(A_D\\)):**\n  \\[\n  A_D = P_D + (P_D \\times r_D \\times d)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  A_D = 100 + (100 \\times 0.10 \\times d) = 100 + 10d\n  \\]\n\n- **Total Amount Owed by Fergie (\\(A_F\\)):**\n  \\[\n  A_F = P_F + (P_F \\times r_F \\times d)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  A_F = 150 + (150 \\times 0.05 \\times d) = 150 + 7.5d\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nCalculating these step by step:\n- For Darren: \n  - Interest per day = \\(100 \\times 0.10 = 10\\) clams\n  - After \\(d\\) days, interest = \\(10 \\times d\\) clams\n  - Total \\(A_D = 100 + 10d\\) clams\n\n- For Fergie:\n  - Interest per day = \\(150 \\times 0.05 = 7.5\\) clams\n  - After \\(d\\) days, interest = \\(7.5 \\times d\\) clams\n  - Total \\(A_F = 150 + 7.5d\\) clams\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLooks good so far. The equations are set up correctly based on the simple interest formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Equate the Two Amounts**\n\nTo find out when Darren and Fergie owe the same amount, set \\(A_D = A_F\\):\n\\[\n100 + 10d = 150 + 7.5d\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThis is now a linear equation in terms of \\(d\\). Solving for \\(d\\) will give us the number of days after which their debts are equal.\n\n**Check:**\n\nBefore solving, let\u2019s see if it makes sense to proceed\u2014both sides are equal in structure (linear in \\(d\\)), so it should be solvable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solve the Equation for \\(d\\)**\n\nLet\u2019s solve the equation step by step:\n\n1. **Subtract \\(7.5d\\) from both sides:**\n   \\[\n   100 + 10d - 7.5d = 150 + 7.5d - 7.5d\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   100 + 2.5d = 150\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract 100 from both sides:**\n   \\[\n   2.5d = 150 - 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2.5d = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide both sides by 2.5:**\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{50}{2.5} = 20\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute\u201420 days? Let me double-check my calculations and ensure everything adds up correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s plug \\(d = 20\\) back into both equations to see if they indeed equal.\n\n- **For Darren:**\n  \\[\n  A_D = 100 + 10 \\times 20 = 100 + 200 = 300 \\text{ clams}\n  \\]\n\n- **For Fergie:**\n  \\[\n  A_F = 150 + 7.5 \\times 20 = 150 + 150 = 300 \\text{ clams}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nBoth amounts are equal at 300 clams after 20 days. So, the solution seems correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense\u2014my earlier calculations were correct, and the value of \\(d\\) aligns with both borrowers owing the same amount.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Approach Validation:** By setting up the equations for both debts and solving them, I arrived at a coherent solution. This method is reliable for simple interest problems where you're determining equality between two linear conditions.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** While exploring different strategies, the proportionality approach seemed less direct, and the graphical method was impractical without visual tools. Returning to the basics with linear equations worked best.\n\n- **Checking Work:** Regularly checking each step ensured accuracy and confidence in the final answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDarren and Fergie will owe the same amount in **20 days**.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough mimics a natural human thought process\u2014brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking work along the way, and adjusting approaches as needed.

  "ground_truth": "Let $t$ be the number of days that has passed. Darren's balance, in clams, is $100(1 + 0.10t) = 100 + 10t,$ whereas Fergie's balance, in clams, is $150(1 + 0.05t) = 150 + 7.5t$. Setting them equal to each other, we have $100 + 10t = 150 + 7.5t.$ Collecting like terms, we have $2.5t = 50,$ so $t = \\boxed{20\\text{ days}}.$"
