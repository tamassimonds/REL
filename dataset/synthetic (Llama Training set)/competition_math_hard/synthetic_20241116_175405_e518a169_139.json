    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process and explore different strategies, checking and reflecting along the way to ensure I'm on the right track. Here\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem involves Alexio having 100 cards numbered 1 to 100, and he needs to pick one card randomly. We need to find the probability that the number on the chosen card is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** This immediately reminds me of problems involving multiple sets where we need to account for overlaps. I recall using this method before to avoid double-counting multiples that belong to more than one set.\n  \n- **Counting Multiples:** I could simply count how many numbers are multiples of 2, 3, or 5 within 1 to 100. But I need to be careful not to double-count numbers like 6, which are multiples of both 2 and 3.\n\n- **Complementary Counting:** Another approach could be to count the numbers that are *not* multiples of 2, 3, or 5 and subtract from the total. This might be more straightforward to avoid over-counting.\n\nHmm, the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle seems like a solid start, but I\u2019ll keep the other strategies in mind if I get stuck. Let\u2019s proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n\n**Thinking:**\n\nI know that to find the probability of picking a card that's a multiple of 2, 3, or 5, I need to count all such multiples from 1 to 100. However, since some numbers are multiples of more than one of these, I can't simply add them up; I'll need to subtract the overlaps.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Count Multiples of Each:**\n\n   - **Multiples of 2:** These are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. There are \\( \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\) multiples.\n   \n   - **Multiples of 3:** These are 3, 6, 9, ..., 99. There are \\( \\frac{100}{3} \\) rounded down \\( = 33 \\).\n   \n   - **Multiples of 5:** These are 5, 10, 15, ..., 100. There are \\( \\frac{100}{5} = 20 \\).\n\n   So far:\n   - Multiples of 2: 50\n   - Multiples of 3: 33\n   - Multiples of 5: 20\n\n   **Total without considering overlaps:** \\( 50 + 33 + 20 = 103 \\)\n\n2. **Subtract Overlapping Multiples:**\n\n   - **Multiples of 6 (2 \u00d7 3):** These are 6, 12, 18, ..., 96. \\( \\frac{100}{6} = 16 \\).\n   \n   - **Multiples of 10 (2 \u00d7 5):** These are 10, 20, 30, ..., 100. \\( \\frac{100}{10} = 10 \\).\n   \n   - **Multiples of 15 (3 \u00d7 5):** These are 15, 30, 45, 60, ..., 90. \\( \\frac{100}{15} = 6 \\).\n   \n   - **Multiples of 30 (2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5):** These are 30, 60, 90. \\( \\frac{100}{30} = 3 \\).\n\n   **Total overlaps:** \\( 16 + 10 + 6 - 3 = 29 \\)\n\n   **Adjusted total:** \\( 103 - 29 = 74 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute. I subtracted the overlap \u201cMultiples of 30\u201d twice (once in the pair overlaps and once in the three-way overlap). Let me recheck this.\n\n**Correction:**\n\nThe correct adjustment should be adding back the multiples of 30 because they were subtracted three times (once for each pair) but only needed to be subtracted once.\n\nSo, the adjusted total should be:\n\n\\[\n103 - (16 + 10 + 6) + 3 = 103 - 32 + 3 = 74\n\\]\n\nAh, I see, adding back the 3 was necessary to correct the over-subtraction.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes it make sense that 74 out of 100 numbers are multiples of 2, 3, or 5? Given that multiples of 2 alone are 50, adding more from 3 and 5 seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thinking:**\n\nNow that I've determined there are 74 favorable outcomes (multiples of 2, 3, or 5), the probability is simply the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{74}{100}\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{74}{100} = \\frac{37}{50} \\quad (\\text{by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2})\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me double-check. Does simplifying 74/100 to 37/50 make sense? Yes, both numbers can be divided by 2 without leaving remainders.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Validating the Approach**\n\n**Thinking:**\n\nIs there another way to confirm this result? Maybe using complementary counting might help to verify the accuracy.\n\n**Sample Strategy:**\n\n- **Count Numbers Not Multiples of 2, 3, or 5:**\n  \n  - Total numbers: 100\n  - Numbers that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5: 74 (from Inclusion-Exclusion)\n\n  Therefore, numbers not multiples of 2, 3, or 5 are:\n\n  \\[\n  100 - 74 = 26\n  \\]\n\n- **Probability of Not Picking a Multiple:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{26}{100} = \\frac{13}{50}\n  \\]\n\n- **Probability of Picking a Multiple:**\n\n  \\[\n  1 - \\frac{13}{50} = \\frac{50}{50} - \\frac{13}{50} = \\frac{37}{50}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth methods converge to the same probability, \\(\\frac{37}{50}\\). This consistency adds confidence to the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thinking:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me ensure that all steps logically flow and that there are no miscalculations.\n\n- The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle was applied correctly after addressing the over-counting.\n- The probability calculations are straightforward and simplified appropriately.\n- Validating through complementary counting corroborates the result.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes \\(\\frac{37}{50}\\) seem reasonable? Converting to a decimal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{37}{50} = 0.74\n\\]\n\nSo, a 74% chance of picking a multiple of 2, 3, or 5 aligns with the high frequency of such multiples within the range.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies, applying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle meticulously, and validating the result through complementary counting, the probability that Alexio picks a card numbered as a multiple of 2, 3, or 5 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{37}{50}}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant reflection and checking, ensures a robust and correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "There are 50 numbers between 1-100 inclusive which are divisible by 2 --- all the even numbers. To avoid overcounting, we must find all the odd multiples of 3. Beginning with 3, the sequence of all such numbers is $3, 9, 15\\cdots99$, which gives $\\dfrac{99-3}{6}+1=17$ such numbers.\n\nFinally, we must find all odd multiples of 5 which are not divisible by 3. These are 5, 25, 35, 55, 65, 85, and 95. This gives a final count of $50+17+7=74$ numbers between 1-100 inclusive which are multiples of 2, 3, or 5.\n\nThe probability that Alexio selects one of these is therefore $\\boxed{\\dfrac{37}{50}}$."
