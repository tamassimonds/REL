    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, mimicking a human's thought process. We'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect frequently, and adjust our approach as needed. Here's how I would naturally think through it, including initial brainstorming, exploring various methods, checking work, and being open to changing directions.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nLooking at the question, I'm asked to find the **shortest distance between two circles** defined by their equations:\n\n1. \\( x^2 - 10x + y^2 - 4y - 7 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 + 14x + y^2 + 6y + 49 = 0 \\)\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Similar to Previous Problems:** This reminds me of problems where I had to find distances between geometric figures. Circles often involve their centers and radii.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Identify Centers and Radii:** Maybe I can find the centers and radii of these circles and use that information.\n  - **Graphical Approach:** Visualizing the circles could help understand their positions relative to each other.\n  - **Coordinate Transformation:** Completing the square might help rewrite the equations in standard form.\n  - **Distance Formula:** Once I have the centers, perhaps I can directly calculate the distance between them.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure if just finding the distance between centers is sufficient, especially if the circles overlap or touch.\n\n**Reflecting on the Approach:**  \nMaybe starting by rewriting the circle equations to find centers and radii would be a good first step. If that doesn't seem to lead me anywhere, I can explore other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Rewriting the Circle Equations to Standard Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI recall that the standard form of a circle's equation is \\( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \\), where \\( (h, k) \\) is the center and \\( r \\) is the radius. To identify the centers and radii of the given circles, I should rewrite their equations in this form.\n\n**Working on the First Circle:**\n\n\\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 - 4y - 7 = 0 \\]\n\n**Complete the Square for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):**\n\n- **For \\( x \\):**\n  - Take the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is -10, halve it to get -5, and square it to get 25.\n  - Add and subtract 25 inside the equation.\n\n- **For \\( y \\):**\n  - Take the coefficient of \\( y \\), which is -4, halve it to get -2, and square it to get 4.\n  - Add and subtract 4 inside the equation.\n\n**Rewriting the Equation:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 - 4y + 4 = 7 + 25 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that looks clean. The first circle is now in standard form with center \\( (5, 2) \\) and radius \\( 6 \\) (since \\( 6^2 = 36 \\)).\n\n**Working on the Second Circle:**\n\n\\[ x^2 + 14x + y^2 + 6y + 49 = 0 \\]\n\n**Complete the Square for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):**\n\n- **For \\( x \\):**\n  - Coefficient of \\( x \\) is 14; halve it to get 7, and square it to get 49.\n  - Add and subtract 49 inside the equation.\n\n- **For \\( y \\):**\n  - Coefficient of \\( y \\) is 6; halve it to get 3, and square it to get 9.\n  - Add and subtract 9 inside the equation.\n\n**Rewriting the Equation:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 14x + 49 + y^2 + 6y + 9 = -49 + 49 + 9\n\\]\n\\[\n(x + 7)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 9\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis also looks good. The second circle is in standard form with center \\( (-7, -3) \\) and radius \\( 3 \\) (since \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)).\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, I correctly completed the square for both circles and obtained their centers and radii.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Distance Between the Centers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the centers of both circles, I can use the distance formula to find the distance between these two points. This will help determine how far apart the circles are.\n\n**Distance Formula:**\n\nThe distance \\( d \\) between two points \\( (h_1, k_1) \\) and \\( (h_2, k_2) \\) is:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(h_2 - h_1)^2 + (k_2 - k_1)^2}\n\\]\n\n**Plugging in the Coordinates:**\n\n- Center of the first circle: \\( (5, 2) \\)\n- Center of the second circle: \\( (-7, -3) \\)\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{((-7) - 5)^2 + ((-3) - 2)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(-12)^2 + (-5)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{144 + 25}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{169}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = 13\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the distance between the centers is \\( 13 \\). But is this the shortest distance between the circles? Wait, I need to consider the radii. The shortest distance might be affected by the sizes of the circles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Accounting for the Radii of the Circles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the **shortest distance between the circles**, I need to consider their radii. The shortest distance is the distance between the centers minus the sum of the radii **only if the circles do not overlap**. If they do overlap, the shortest distance would be zero.\n\n**Checking for Overlap:**\n\n- **Radius of the First Circle (\\( r_1 \\)):** \\( 6 \\)\n- **Radius of the Second Circle (\\( r_2 \\)):** \\( 3 \\)\n\n**Calculating the Sum of Radii:**\n\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 = 6 + 3 = 9\n\\]\n\n**Comparison with the Distance Between Centers:**\n\n\\[\nd = 13 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r_1 + r_2 = 9\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 13 > 9 \\), the circles **do not overlap**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense. Since the distance between the centers (\\( 13 \\)) is greater than the sum of the radii (\\( 9 \\)), the circles are separate. Therefore, the shortest distance between them is the distance between the centers minus the sum of the radii.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Shortest Distance Between the Circles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we know the circles do not overlap, the shortest distance between them is the distance between their centers minus the sum of their radii.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Shortest Distance} = d - (r_1 + r_2) = 13 - 9 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the shortest distance between the two circles is \\( 4 \\). This seems logical because the circles are separate, and the distance between their edges would be the distance between their centers minus their combined radii.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Everything Makes Sense**\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- **Centers and Radii:** I correctly identified the centers and radii by completing the square.\n- **Distance Calculation:** The distance between centers was calculated accurately using the distance formula.\n- **Overlap Consideration:** The circles do not overlap since \\( 13 > 9 \\).\n- **Final Distance Calculation:** The shortest distance is logically derived by subtracting the sum of radii from the distance between centers.\n\n**Possible Concerns:**\n\n- **Is \\( 4 \\) Too Small?** Given the distances and radii involved, \\( 4 \\) seems reasonable.\n- **Did I Miss Overlap?** No, the sum of the radii is less than the distance between centers, confirming no overlap.\n\n**Natural Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The approach was correct, and the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, completing the square to find the centers and radii, calculating the distance between centers, and accounting for the radii, the **shortest distance between the circles is \\( 4 \\)**.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting as needed, led us to the correct solution. It\u2019s crucial to consider each aspect\u2014like whether the circles overlap or not\u2014to ensure the final answer is accurate.",

  "ground_truth": "We complete the square for the first equation by observing that the first equation is equivalent to \\[\n(x^2-10x +25) +(y^2-4y +4)=36,\n\\] which is also equivalent to \\[\n(x-5)^2 +(y-2)^2 =6^2.\n\\] Similarly, the equation for the second circle is \\[\n(x+7)^2 +(y+3)^2 =3^2.\n\\] Hence, the centers of the circles are $(5,2)$ and $(-7,-3)$, and the radii of the circles are equal to 6 and 3, respectively.  The distance between the points $(5,2)$ and $(-7,-3)$ by the distance formula is $\\sqrt{(5-(-7))^2+(2-(-3))^2}=\\sqrt{12^2+5^2}=\\sqrt{169}=13$.  Therefore, to find the shortest distance between the two circles, we must subtract from $13$ the sum of the radii of the two circles.  Thus, the shortest distance between the circles is $13-3-6 = \\boxed{4}$."
