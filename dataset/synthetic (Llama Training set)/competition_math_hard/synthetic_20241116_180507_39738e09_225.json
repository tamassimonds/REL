    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's dive into this problem, thinking step-by-step, exploring different strategies, and reflecting along the way to ensure we're on the right track. I'll approach this as I would naturally, brainstorming various methods, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, several key points stand out:\n\n1. **Point on the Parabola:** It passes through \\((1, 5)\\).\n2. **Focus's y-coordinate:** The y-coordinate of the focus is \\(3\\).\n3. **Axis of Symmetry:** Parallel to the x-axis.\n4. **Vertex on the y-axis:** The vertex lies on the y-axis.\n\nBefore jumping into solving, I recall that parabolas can be oriented differently (upward, downward, sideways) depending on their properties. Here, the axis of symmetry is parallel to the x-axis, which suggests the parabola opens either to the right or left.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- This reminds me of parabolas that open sideways. In such cases, the standard form involves \\(y\\) and \\(x^2\\) terms.\n- The focus and vertex information should help determine the specific form and coefficients of the parabola.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure where to start. Maybe I need to write down the general equation for a parabola opening sideways and see how the given points fit into it.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Standard Equation for Sideways Parabolas:**\n   - The general form is \\((y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex and \\(p\\) helps locate the focus.\n\n2. **Incorporate the Given Points:**\n   - Plugging in the given point \\((1, 5)\\) and the focus's y-coordinate into the equations might help solve for the vertex and \\(p\\).\n\n3. **Check the Axis of Symmetry:**\n   - Since the axis of symmetry is parallel to the x-axis, the vertex's x-coordinate should be \\(0\\) (since it lies on the y-axis).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, does setting the vertex's x-coordinate to \\(0\\) align with the vertex being on the y-axis? Yes, it does. So, this seems like a valid approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Set Up the Standard Equation**\n\nGiven that the parabola has its axis of symmetry parallel to the x-axis, the standard equation is:\n\n\\[\n(y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex.\n- \\(p\\) determines the distance between the vertex and the focus.\n\n**Given:**\n- Vertex lies on the y-axis: \\(h = 0\\).\n- Focus's y-coordinate is \\(3\\), so the focus is at \\((h + p, k) = (0 + p, k) = (p, k)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, the focus is at \\((p, k)\\). But we only know the y-coordinate is \\(3\\), which means \\(k = 3\\) and \\(p\\) is still unknown.\n\n**Equation Becomes:**\n\\[\n(y - 3)^2 = 4p(x - 0) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad (y - 3)^2 = 4px\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- This setup makes sense. The vertex is on the y-axis, and the focus's y-coordinate is \\(3\\). We're just missing the x-coordinate of the focus, which is \\(p\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Use the Given Point to Find p**\n\nWe know the parabola passes through \\((1, 5)\\). Let's substitute \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 5\\) into the equation to find \\(p\\).\n\n\\[\n(5 - 3)^2 = 4p(1 - 0)\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n2^2 = 4p(1)\n\\]\n\\[\n4 = 4p\n\\]\n\\[\np = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, \\(p = 1\\). This means the focus is at \\((1, 3)\\), and the vertex is at \\((0, 3)\\). That seems consistent.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does it make sense?** The distance between the vertex and the focus is \\(1\\), which aligns with \\(p = 1\\). Plus, the parabola opens to the right since \\(p\\) is positive.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Write the Specific Equation of the Parabola**\n\nNow that we have \\(p = 1\\), let's substitute back into the standard equation:\n\n\\[\n(y - 3)^2 = 4(1)(x - 0) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad (y - 3)^2 = 4x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This looks like a standard equation for a rightward-opening parabola. It should be straightforward to convert this into the desired general form.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Is this correct?** I plugged in the known values and derived a specific parabola equation. It aligns with the properties given.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Convert to the General Form \\(ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0\\)**\n\nTo express the parabola in the required general form, let's rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\n(y - 3)^2 - 4x = 0\n\\]\n\n**Expand \\((y - 3)^2\\):**\n\\[\ny^2 - 6y + 9 - 4x = 0\n\\]\n\\[\ny^2 - 6y + 9 - 4x = 0\n\\]\n\n**Rearrange:**\n\\[\n4x - y^2 + 6y - 9 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n4x - y^2 + 6y - 9 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I need to ensure that the coefficients meet the given conditions: \\(c\\) is positive, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the absolute values of coefficients is \\(1\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does \\(c\\) need to be positive?** Yes, but in this equation, the \\(y^2\\) term has a negative coefficient. To make \\(c\\) positive, let's multiply the entire equation by \\(-1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Multiply by -1 to Make \\(c\\) Positive**\n\n\\[\n-4x + y^2 - 6y + 9 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Now, the \\(y^2\\) coefficient (\\(c\\)) is positive, which is good. Let's check the gcd condition.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Coefficients:** \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 0\\), \\(c = 1\\), \\(d = -4\\), \\(e = -6\\), \\(f = 9\\).\n- **Gcd of absolute values:** \\(\\gcd(1, 0, 1, 4, 6, 9) = 1\\).\n- **Condition Met?** Yes.\n\n**Final Equation:**\n\\[\ny^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This equation satisfies all the given conditions: \\(c\\) is positive, and the gcd of the coefficients is \\(1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore concluding, let's ensure that this equation aligns with all the properties given in the problem:\n\n1. **Passes Through \\((1, 5)\\):**\n   \\[\n   5^2 - 4(1) - 6(5) + 9 = 25 - 4 - 30 + 9 = 0 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Focus's y-coordinate is \\(3\\):**\n   - **Calculated Earlier:** The focus is at \\((1, 3)\\), which aligns with the given condition.\n\n3. **Axis of Symmetry is Parallel to the x-axis:**\n   - **Satisfied by the Equation:** The general form supports this orientation.\n\n4. **Vertex Lies on the y-axis:**\n   - **Vertex Calculated Earlier:** The vertex is at \\((0, 3)\\), matching the condition.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Everything Checks Out:** All properties align with the final equation, confirming its correctness.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- By starting with the standard equation for a sideways parabola and incorporating the given properties step-by-step, I successfully derived the equation \\(y^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0\\).\n- Throughout the process, I regularly checked and reflected on each step, ensuring that the approach was correct and making adjustments as needed. This methodical approach helped in achieving the correct solution confidently.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0\n\\]",
