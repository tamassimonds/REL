    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming how to approach it, reflecting frequently, and being open to changing strategies if something doesn't seem right. Think of it like a human tackling a puzzle\u2014exploring different paths, checking for correctness along the way, and adjusting as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, it reminds me of probability questions involving combinations and roles (or types) being assigned randomly. Here's what stands out to me:\n\n1. **Setup:** There are three guests, each should receive a breakfast with one nut roll, one cheese roll, and one fruit roll. So, each breakfast consists of three rolls of different types.\n\n2. **Packing Process:** Nine rolls in total are wrapped (three of each type), and after wrapping, they become indistinguishable.\n\n3. **Distribution:** Each guest randomly receives three rolls.\n\n4. **Probability Goal:** We need to find the probability that each guest gets one roll of each type.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Thought:** This seems like a probability distribution problem where we need to determine the likelihood of a specific combination being assigned to each guest.\n\n- **Strategy Ideas:** \n  - **Combinatorial Approach:** Calculate the total number of ways to distribute the rolls and the number of favorable distributions where each guest gets one of each type.\n  - **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Consider overlaps where at least one guest doesn't get all three types and adjust accordingly.\n\n- **Reflection:** The combinatorial approach feels straightforward, but I need to make sure all rolls are allocated correctly without duplication. The inclusion-exclusion principle might complicate things, so I'll start with combinatorial methods and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Total Number of Ways to Distribute Rolls**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's first determine the total number of ways to distribute the nine rolls among the three guests. Since the rolls are indistinguishable by type but not by recipient, this is a combinatorial distribution problem.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Total Rolls:** 9 (3 nut, 3 cheese, 3 fruit)\n- **Distribution Per Guest:** Each guest receives 3 rolls.\n\nThe total number of ways to distribute 9 indistinguishable rolls into three groups of 3 is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\frac{9!}{3! \\times 3! \\times 3!}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that step by step:\n\n- **Factorial Calculations:**\n  \\[\n  9! = 362880\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3! = 6  \\quad \\text{(since there are three types)}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3! \\times 3! \\times 3! = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\n  \\]\n  \n- **Total Ways:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{362880}{216} = 1680\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that number seems a bit off at first glance. But after checking the calculations, it aligns. So, the total number of ways to distribute the rolls is **1680**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Favorable Outcomes Where Each Guest Gets One of Each Type**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to figure out how many of these distributions are favorable\u2014that is, each guest receives one nut roll, one cheese roll, and one fruit roll.\n\nTo simplify, let's consider assigning one roll of each type to a guest and see how many ways we can do that.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Assign Nut Rolls:**\n   - There are 3 nut rolls.\n   - Choose 1 nut roll for Guest 1, 1 for Guest 2, and the remaining 1 for Guest 3.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of ways} = \\frac{3!}{1! \\times 1! \\times 1!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Assign Cheese Rolls:**\n   - Similarly, choose 1 cheese roll for each guest.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of ways} = \\frac{3!}{1! \\times 1! \\times 1!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Assign Fruit Rolls:**\n   - Again, choose 1 fruit roll per guest.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of ways} = \\frac{3!}{1! \\times 1! \\times 1!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Favorable Assignments:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total favorable} = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo there are **216** favorable outcomes where each guest gets one roll of each type. This seems reasonable because each type's distribution is independent.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible distributions.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{216}{1680}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, let me simplify that fraction to see if it can be reduced.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{216}{1680} = \\frac{27}{210} \\quad \\text{(divide both numerator and denominator by 8)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{27}{210} = \\frac{9}{70} \\quad \\text{(divide both numerator and denominator by 3)}\n\\]\n\nSo, the simplified probability is **\\(\\frac{9}{70}\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe probability that each guest receives one roll of each type is \\(\\frac{9}{70}\\), which is already in its simplest form. The problem asks for \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\), so \\(m = 9\\) and \\(n = 70\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(m + n = 9 + 70 = 79\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me double-check everything to ensure it's correct. The steps logically lead from calculating the total number of distributions to determining favorable outcomes and then finding the probability. The simplification of the fraction checks out, and the final answer makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy methodically breaking down the problem into manageable steps and continuously reflecting on each stage, we've determined that the probability each guest receives one roll of each type is \\(\\frac{9}{70}\\). Thus, \\(m + n = 79\\).\n\n---\n\nFeel free to ask if you need further clarification or if another approach would be helpful!",
