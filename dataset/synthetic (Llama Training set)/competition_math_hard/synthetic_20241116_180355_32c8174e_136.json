    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure to check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see that Chewbacca has two types of gum: cherry and grape. The issue revolves around losing a pack of cherry gum or finding packs of grape gum, and how these situations affect the ratios of the gum pieces.\n\nInitially, I'm thinking this problem involves setting up ratios and possibly using algebra to find the unknown \\( x \\), which represents the number of pieces in each complete pack. It reminds me of problems where you deal with proportions and variable relationships.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how to start. Maybe I should brainstorm different ways to model the situation\u2014perhaps using equations for the different scenarios provided.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Set Up Equations Based on Ratios:** Use the information about losing a pack versus gaining packs to create equations involving \\( x \\).\n  \n2. **Create a Table or List:** List out the total pieces before and after each scenario to see patterns or relationships.\n\n3. **Use Proportions Directly:** Since the problem deals with ratios being equal, perhaps directly setting up proportion equations could work.\n\n4. **Logically Analyze the Changes:** Think about how losing one pack affects the total versus gaining multiple packs and see if that leads to any insights.\n\nI'm leaning towards starting with **setting up equations based on ratios**, as that seems the most straightforward way to relate the different scenarios quantitatively.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Scenarios**\n\nThe problem presents two key scenarios:\n\n1. **Losing One Pack of Cherry Gum:**\n   - Chewbacca has 20 pieces of cherry gum and 30 pieces of grape gum.\n   - Losing one pack of cherry gum changes the ratio of cherry to grape gum.\n\n2. **Finding Five Packs of Grape Gum:**\n   - Finding five packs of grape gum alters the ratio of cherry to grape gum.\n\nBoth scenarios result in the **same ratio** of cherry to grape gum.\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nSo, the crux of the problem is that despite the different actions (losing vs. finding packs), the ratio remains unchanged. This seems like a unique condition that might help in setting up a relationship between the two scenarios.\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up Variables**\n\nLet\u2019s define our variables:\n\n- Let \\( n \\) be the number of complete packs Chewbacca has for each type of gum.\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of pieces in each complete pack.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Total cherry gum pieces: \\( 20 \\)\n- Total grape gum pieces: \\( 30 \\)\n\n### **Check**\n\nWait, do we know how many packs Chewbacca has? The problem mentions \"some are in complete packs,\" but doesn't specify the number of packs. This might be a problem because without knowing \\( n \\), I'm not sure how to relate it to \\( x \\).\n\nHmm, perhaps there\u2019s another way to set up the problem without needing the exact number of packs.\n\n### **Step 3: Re-approaching the Problem**\n\nMaybe instead of focusing on the number of packs, I should relate the total number of gum pieces directly to the packs involved in each scenario. Let\u2019s think about the ratios before and after each scenario.\n\nThe total number of cherry gum pieces after losing one pack would be \\( 20 - x \\), and the total grape pieces after finding five packs would be \\( 30 + 5x \\).\n\nBut wait, since the ratio remains unchanged, maybe I can set up an equation where the ratio before and after in both scenarios are equal.\n\n### **Step 4: Setting Up the Ratios**\n\nLet's define the ratios:\n\n1. **After Losing One Pack of Cherry Gum:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20 - x}{30} \n   \\]\n\n2. **After Finding Five Packs of Grape Gum:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{30 + 5x} \n   \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, these two ratios are equal:\n\\[\n\\frac{20 - x}{30} = \\frac{20}{30 + 5x}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nThis looks like a solid equation to work with because it directly relates the two scenarios' outcomes. Now, I can solve for \\( x \\).\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Equation**\n\nLet's cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:\n\\[\n(20 - x)(30 + 5x) = 20 \\times 30\n\\]\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\\[\n(20 - x)(30 + 5x) = 600\n\\]\n\\[\n600 + 100x - 30x - 5x^2 = 600\n\\]\n\\[\n600 + 70x - 5x^2 = 600\n\\]\n\nSubtract 600 from both sides:\n\\[\n70x - 5x^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Check**\n\nHmm, I have a quadratic equation here. Let me see if I can factor it to make solving easier.\n\n### **Step 6: Factoring the Quadratic Equation**\n\nLet's factor out the common terms:\n\\[\n5x(14 - x) = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n5x(14 - x) = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nSo, the possible solutions for \\( x \\) are:\n\\[\n5x = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 14 - x = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 14\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, \\( x = 0 \\) doesn't make sense in this context. If each pack has 0 pieces, that would imply no gum in the packs, which is unrealistic. Therefore, the only viable solution is \\( x = 14 \\).\n\n### **Step 7: Validating the Solution**\n\nLet me double-check if \\( x = 14 \\) makes sense within the problem's context.\n\n- **Losing One Pack of Cherry Gum:**\n  - New cherry gum pieces: \\( 20 - 14 = 6 \\)\n  - Grape gum pieces remain: \\( 30 \\)\n  - Ratio: \\( \\frac{6}{30} = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n\n- **Finding Five Packs of Grape Gum:**\n  - New grape gum pieces: \\( 30 + 5 \\times 14 = 30 + 70 = 100 \\)\n  - Cherry gum pieces remain: \\( 20 \\)\n  - Ratio: \\( \\frac{20}{100} = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n\nBoth scenarios yield the same ratio of \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\), which confirms that \\( x = 14 \\) is correct.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nEverything checks out:\n\n- The quadratic equation derived from the ratio condition is correct.\n- Factoring the equation provided a realistic solution.\n- Both scenarios align with the same ratio when \\( x = 14 \\).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming different approaches, setting up and solving the equation based on the given ratios, and thoroughly checking each step, I've determined that the number of pieces in each complete pack is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step process ensured that I explored various strategies, reflected regularly, and validated the solution to arrive at the correct answer confidently.",

  "ground_truth": "If Chewbacca loses one pack of cherry gum, the ratio of the number of pieces of cherry gum he has to the number of pieces of grape gum is $(20-x)/30$. If he instead finds 5 packs of grape gum, this ratio will be $20/(30+5x)$. These ratios must be equal, so we must have  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{20-x}{30} &= \\frac{20}{30+5x} \\quad\\implies\\\\\n(20-x)(30+5x)& = (30)(20) \\quad\\implies\\\\\n(20-x)(5)(6+x) &= (30)(20).\\end{align*}Dividing both sides by 5 gives $$(20-x)(6+x) = (30)(4)$$and expanding the left side of this gives $$120+14x -x^2 = 120.$$Therefore, $x^2-14x=0$, so $x(x-14)=0$.  We can't have $x=0$, so we must have $x=\\boxed{14}$."
