    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting frequently, and checking my work along the way to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nOkay, the problem states:\n\n*Anthony made \\(5\\) of his first \\(12\\) free throw attempts. If he makes \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of his next \\(24\\) attempts, by how many percentage points will he increase his overall success rate percentage? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.*\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Success Rate:** I remember that success rate is the number of successful attempts divided by the total number of attempts, multiplied by \\(100\\%\\). So, I\u2019ll need to calculate the success rate before and after the additional attempts.\n  \n- **Calculating \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):** Making \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of \\(24\\) is straightforward\u2014it's \\(16\\). Wait, that seems too round; maybe I should double-check.\n\n- **Finding the Increase:** After calculating both success rates, I\u2019ll subtract the initial from the final to find the percentage point increase.\n\n**Potential Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation Approach:** Calculate the success rates before and after directly using the numbers given.\n  \n2. **Fraction Simplification:** Simplify fractions to see if there's a pattern or easier way to calculate the percentages.\n  \n3. **Percentage Point Concept:** Focus specifically on how many percentage points increase, rather than absolute percentages.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n- **Misinterpreting \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):** I initially thought about making \\(16\\) out of \\(24\\), but let me double-check that \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) is correct.\n  \n- **Overcomplicating Steps:** Maybe there's a simpler way to see the overall success rate without getting bogged down in fractions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Initial Success Rate**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Calculate the success rate after the first \\(12\\) attempts.\n  \n- Use the formula:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Success Rate} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Number of Successful Attempts}}{\\text{Total Attempts}}\\right) \\times 100\\%\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Number of successful attempts: \\(5\\)\n- Total attempts: \\(12\\)\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial Success Rate} = \\left(\\frac{5}{12}\\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 41.67\\%\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** \\(5\\) out of \\(12\\) is approximately \\(41.67\\%\\). That seems correct because \\(5\\) is a bit less than half of \\(12\\).\n  \n- **Is This Right?** Yes, \\(5/12\\) is roughly \\(41.67\\%\\). No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Number of Successful Attempts in the Next \\(24\\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Calculate \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of \\(24\\) to find the number of successful attempts.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Successful Attempts} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 24 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, \\(16\\) is exactly \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of \\(24\\). No mistakes here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the New Overall Success Rate**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Add the successful attempts from both phases.\n- Add the total attempts from both phases.\n- Calculate the new success rate.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Total successful attempts: \\(5 + 16 = 21\\)\n- Total attempts: \\(12 + 24 = 36\\)\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Success Rate} = \\left(\\frac{21}{36}\\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 58.33\\%\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** \\(21\\) out of \\(36\\) simplifies to \\(7/12\\), which is approximately \\(58.33\\%\\). That seems right.\n  \n- **Is This Correct?** Upon simplifying, \\(7/12\\) is indeed around \\(58.33\\%\\). No errors here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Increase in Success Rate**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Subtract the initial success rate from the new success rate.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Increase} = 58.33\\% - 41.67\\% = 16.66\\%\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does This Add Up?** \\(58.33\\% - 41.67\\%\\) indeed equals \\(16.66\\%\\).\n  \n- **Final Adjustment:** Rounding \\(16.66\\%\\) to the nearest whole number gives \\(17\\%\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Rounding Check:** Since we're asked to round to the nearest whole number, \\(16.66\\%\\) rounds up to \\(17\\%\\).\n  \n- **Final Answer:** The increase in the overall success rate is **17 percentage points**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Process Verification:** Throughout the steps, I continually checked each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n  \n- **Strategy Confirmation:** The direct calculation approach worked well here, providing clear and straightforward results.\n  \n- **Alternative Strategies:** While I considered fraction simplification, the direct method was simple enough to avoid unnecessary complexity.\n\n- **Final Check:** Everything checks out\u2014the initial success rate, the successful attempts in the next phase, the new success rate, and the increase all align correctly.\n\n**Ahh, moment:** At first, I overthought whether making \\(2/3\\) of \\(24\\) was correct, but a quick calculation confirmed it was straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:** By methodically calculating each phase and verifying each step, we've determined that Anthony's overall success rate increases by **17 percentage points**.",

  "ground_truth": "If Anthony makes $2/3$ of his next $24$ attempts, he will make another $16$ free throws. Then he will have $5 + 16 = 21$ successful throws in $12 + 24 = 36$ attempts. That's a success rate of $21/36 = 7/12$, which is $58.3\\%$. His success rate before was $5/12$, which is $41.6\\%$. The increase is $58.3 - 41.6 = 16.7$, or $\\boxed{17\\%}$ to the nearest whole number."
