    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, a few things stand out:\n\n1. **Triangle in the Cartesian Plane:** We're dealing with a triangle whose vertices have specific coordinates.\n  \n2. **Area Given:** The area of the triangle is specified, which is \\(70\\). That sounds key because we often use the area formula to relate the vertices.\n\n3. **Coordinates Known:** Points \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are provided, but point \\(A\\) has coordinates \\((p,q)\\) that we need to find.\n\n4. **Median Slope:** The median to side \\(BC\\) has a slope of \\(-5\\). Median properties are intriguing here.\n\n5. **Objective:** Find the largest possible value of \\(p + q\\).\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of problems where you need to use both the area formula and properties of medians to find unknown coordinates. Let me brainstorm different strategies to approach this.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Using the Area Formula:**\n   - We could use the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its vertices' coordinates to set up an equation involving \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\n2. **Exploit the Median's Slope:**\n   - Since the median's slope is given, we could find the coordinates of the midpoint \\(M\\) of side \\(BC\\) and set up equations based on the slope of the median line.\n\n3. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:**\n   - We could utilize the distance formula to relate the sides and medians, potentially setting up a system of equations.\n\n4. **Vector Method:**\n   - Using vectors to express the median and the area might provide a different perspective.\n\n5. **Check for Linear Relationships:**\n   - With the coordinates and given slope, perhaps there's a linear relationship that can simplify the problem.\n\nI'll start with **using the area formula**, as it's a straightforward way to relate the vertices. If that doesn't lead anywhere, I'll pivot to leveraging the median's slope.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Using the Area Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of triangle \\(ABC\\) can be calculated using the determinant method:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(A = 70\\)\n- \\(B = (12, 19)\\)\n- \\(C = (23, 20)\\)\n- \\(A = (p, q)\\)\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n\n\\[\n70 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 12(20 - q) + 23(q - 19) + p(19 - 20) \\right|\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n70 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 12(20 - q) + 23(q - 19) - p \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n140 = \\left| 240 - 12q + 23q - 437 - p \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n140 = \\left| 11q - 197 - p \\right|\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis gives us an equation involving \\(p\\) and \\(q\\):\n\n\\[\n|11q - p - 197| = 140\n\\]\n\nWhich can be split into two cases:\n\n1. \\(11q - p - 197 = 140\\)\n2. \\(11q - p - 197 = -140\\)\n\nLet\u2019s denote these as **Equation (1)** and **Equation (2)** for ease.\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, does this make sense? The area formula should give us a direct relationship between the variables. Since both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are involved linearly, having two equations is reasonable to solve for them. Let's proceed to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploiting the Median's Slope**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe median to side \\(BC\\) is the line segment from \\(A\\) to the midpoint \\(M\\) of \\(BC\\). Knowing the slope of this median is \\(-5\\) allows us to set up another equation.\n\nFirst, find the midpoint \\(M\\):\n\n\\[\nM = \\left( \\frac{x_B + x_C}{2}, \\frac{y_B + y_C}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12 + 23}{2}, \\frac{19 + 20}{2} \\right) = \\left( 17.5, 19.5 \\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, the slope \\(m\\) of line \\(AM\\) is:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_M - y_A}{x_M - x_A} = -5\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(M = (17.5, 19.5)\\) and \\(A = (p, q)\\), we can set up the slope equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{19.5 - q}{17.5 - p} = -5\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nCross-multiplying to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n19.5 - q = -5(17.5 - p)\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n19.5 - q = -87.5 + 5p\n\\]\n\\[\n5p + q = 107\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is a nice linear equation relating \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Let's call this **Equation (3)**. Now, we have:\n\n- **Equation (1):** \\(11q - p = -57\\)\n- **Equation (2):** \\(11q - p = 337\\)\n- **Equation (3):** \\(5p + q = 107\\)\n\nThe goal is to find the largest possible value of \\(p + q\\), so we need to solve these equations.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes using the median's slope make sense? Yes, because the median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side, and knowing its slope directly ties \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) together.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWe can solve the system of equations to find the values of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Given that we have three equations but only two variables, it's possible that one of the equations is redundant or that multiple solutions exist depending on which case from Equation (1) and (2) we choose.\n\nLet's proceed by considering both cases separately.\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 1: \\(11q - p = -57\\)**\n\n**Substituting into Equation (3):**\n\nFrom **Equation (3):**\n\n\\[\n5p + q = 107\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{107 - q}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Substitute into Equation (1):**\n\n\\[\n11q - \\left(\\frac{107 - q}{5}\\right) = -57\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 5 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n55q - (107 - q) = -285\n\\]\n\\[\n55q - 107 + q = -285\n\\]\n\\[\n56q = -285 + 107\n\\]\n\\[\n56q = -178\n\\]\n\\[\nq = -\\frac{178}{56} = -\\frac{89}{28}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(p\\):**\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{107 - (-\\frac{89}{28})}{5} = \\frac{107 + \\frac{89}{28}}{5}\n\\]\n\nConvert \\(107\\) to a fraction with denominator \\(28\\):\n\n\\[\n107 = \\frac{2996}{28}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{\\frac{2996}{28} + \\frac{89}{28}}{5} = \\frac{\\frac{3085}{28}}{5} = \\frac{3085}{140} = \\frac{617}{28}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, so for Case 1, we have:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{617}{28}, \\quad q = -\\frac{89}{28}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(p + q\\):\n\n\\[\np + q = \\frac{617}{28} - \\frac{89}{28} = \\frac{528}{28} = \\frac{264}{14} = \\frac{132}{7}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs this value reasonable? Let me quickly check:\n\n\\[\np + q = \\frac{132}{7} \\approx 18.857\n\\]\n\nDoes this seem plausible given the coordinates provided? Let me think... A value around 19 seems reasonable, considering the coordinates of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are both in the low 20s. So, this value could be possible.\n\nBut wait, to ensure this is indeed the maximum, let's check Case 2 as well.\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 2: \\(11q - p = 337\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's see what values we get in this scenario and compare.\n\n**Substituting into Equation (3):**\n\n\\[\n5p + q = 107\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{107 - q}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Substitute into Equation (2):**\n\n\\[\n11q - \\left(\\frac{107 - q}{5}\\right) = 337\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 5:\n\n\\[\n55q - (107 - q) = 1685\n\\]\n\\[\n55q - 107 + q = 1685\n\\]\n\\[\n56q = 1685 + 107\n\\]\n\\[\n56q = 1792\n\\]\n\\[\nq = \\frac{1792}{56} = \\frac{448}{14} = \\frac{224}{7}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(p\\):**\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{107 - \\frac{224}{7}}{5} = \\frac{\\frac{749}{7} - \\frac{224}{7}}{5} = \\frac{\\frac{525}{7}}{5} = \\frac{525}{35} = 15\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFor Case 2, we have:\n\n\\[\np = 15, \\quad q = \\frac{224}{7} = 32\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(p + q\\):\n\n\\[\np + q = 15 + 32 = 47\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nSo, in Case 2, \\(p + q = 47\\). \n\nComparing both cases:\n\n- **Case 1:** \\(p + q = \\frac{132}{7} \\approx 18.857\\)\n- **Case 2:** \\(p + q = 47\\)\n\nClearly, **Case 2** gives a larger value. \n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nWait a second, \\(p + q = 47\\) seems quite large compared to the coordinates of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). Let's double-check the calculations to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying Case 2**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's carefully verify the steps taken in Case 2 to ensure the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Re-examining Equations:**\n\nWe had:\n\n- **Equation (2):** \\(11q - p = 337\\)\n- **Equation (3):** \\(5p + q = 107\\)\n\nSolving these:\n\n**From Equation (3):**\n\n\\[\n5p + q = 107 \\implies p = \\frac{107 - q}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Substituting into Equation (2):**\n\n\\[\n11q - \\left( \\frac{107 - q}{5} \\right) = 337\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 5 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n55q - (107 - q) = 1685\n\\]\n\\[\n55q - 107 + q = 1685\n\\]\n\\[\n56q = 1685 + 107\n\\]\n\\[\n56q = 1792\n\\]\n\\[\nq = \\frac{1792}{56} = \\frac{448}{14} = \\frac{224}{7}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(p\\) Again:**\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{107 - \\frac{224}{7}}{5} = \\frac{\\frac{749}{7} - \\frac{224}{7}}{5} = \\frac{\\frac{525}{7}}{5} = \\frac{525}{35} = 15\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(p + q\\):**\n\n\\[\np + q = 15 + 32 = 47\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis checks out. The calculations are correct, and \\(p + q = 47\\). \n\n#### **Does This Make Sense?**\n\n\\(p + q = 47\\) implies that the point \\(A\\) is at \\((15, 32)\\), which is considerably larger than the coordinates of points \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). \n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBut is it logical for \\(A\\) to be so far away from \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) while still maintaining an area of \\(70\\) and a median with slope \\(-5\\)?\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me consider the geometry. If the area is \\(70\\) and \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are relatively close, point \\(A\\) must indeed be at a considerable distance to maintain such an area, especially with the given median slope.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDespite the seemingly large value, the calculations are consistent, and the constraints of the problem are satisfied. Therefore, **Case 2** is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nAfter exploring both cases and verifying the calculations, the largest possible value of \\(p + q\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{47}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nInitially, I approached the problem by leveraging the area formula to set up equations relating \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Then, by incorporating the slope of the median, I established a second equation. \n\nSolving these equations revealed two possible cases. Although **Case 1** yielded a smaller value for \\(p + q\\), **Case 2** provided the largest value, \\(47\\). \n\nThroughout, checking the plausibility of the results ensured that, despite the seemingly large final answer, the calculations aligned with the problem's constraints.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough captures the essence of human problem-solving, complete with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the correctness of the approach.",

  "ground_truth": "The midpoint $M$ of line segment $\\overline{BC}$ is $\\left(\\frac{35}{2}, \\frac{39}{2}\\right)$. The equation of the median can be found by $-5 = \\frac{q - \\frac{39}{2}}{p - \\frac{35}{2}}$. Cross multiply and simplify to yield that $-5p + \\frac{35 \\cdot 5}{2} = q - \\frac{39}{2}$, so $q = -5p + 107$.\nUse determinants to find that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{vmatrix}p & 12 & 23 \\\\  q & 19 & 20 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1\\end{vmatrix} = 70$ (note that there is a missing absolute value; we will assume that the other solution for the triangle will give a smaller value of $p+q$, which is provable by following these steps over again). We can calculate this determinant to become $140 = \\begin{vmatrix} 12 & 23 \\\\ 19 & 20 \\end{vmatrix} - \\begin{vmatrix} p & q \\\\ 23 & 20 \\end{vmatrix} + \\begin{vmatrix} p & q \\\\ 12 & 19 \\end{vmatrix}$ $\\Longrightarrow 140 = 240 - 437 - 20p + 23q + 19p - 12q$ $= -197 - p + 11q$. Thus, $q = \\frac{1}{11}p - \\frac{337}{11}$.\nSetting this equation equal to the equation of the median, we get that $\\frac{1}{11}p - \\frac{337}{11} = -5p + 107$, so $\\frac{56}{11}p = \\frac{107 \\cdot 11 + 337}{11}$. Solving produces that $p = 15$. Substituting backwards yields that $q = 32$; the solution is $p + q = \\boxed{47}$."
