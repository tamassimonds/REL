I\u2019ll walk through my thought process, checking and reflecting at each step, just like I naturally would when tackling a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the question, **\u201cTwenty switches in an office computer network are to be connected so that each switch has a direct connection to exactly three other switches. How many connections will be necessary?\u201d**, a few initial reactions come to mind:\n\n1. **Graph Theory Connection:** This reminds me of problems related to graph theory, particularly those involving vertices (switches) and edges (connections).\n   \n2. **Total Degrees Insight:** Each switch is connected to three others, which makes me think about the total number of connections required.\n\n3. **Possible Overcounting:** I recall that if I just multiply the number of switches by the number of connections per switch, I might be overcounting because each connection involves two switches.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n- **Graph Theory Approach:** Model the switches as vertices and connections as edges.\n  \n- **Total Degrees Method:** Calculate the total number of degrees (connections) and then see how that relates to the number of edges.\n\n- **Combinatorial Approach:** Consider how many unique pairs of switches need to be connected.\n\nI\u2019ll start with the **Total Degrees Method** because it seems straightforward, but I'll be ready to shift if it doesn't work out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Total Degrees**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEach of the 20 switches is connected to exactly 3 others. So, to find the total number of connections (or degrees), I multiply the number of switches by the number of connections per switch.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Degrees} = \\text{Number of switches} \\times \\text{Connections per switch} = 20 \\times 3 = 60\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a second\u201460 total degrees doesn\u2019t directly tell me the number of unique connections because each connection involves two switches. So, I'm likely **overcounting** here. Each connection is counted twice (once for each switch it connects).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this number make sense? Since each connection involves two switches, counting all degrees gives me double the actual number of connections needed. So, I need to divide by 2 to find the **actual number of connections**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Adjust for Overcounting**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the actual number of unique connections, I should divide the total degrees by 2 since each connection is counted twice.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Connections} = \\frac{\\text{Total Degrees}}{2} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n30 seems like a reasonable number of connections. Each switch connects to three others, and by adjusting for overcounting, 30 total connections make sense.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify:\n\n- If each switch connects to 3 others, and there are 20 switches, without adjusting, it looks like 60 connections.\n- Dividing by 2 accounts for each connection being counted twice.\n- So, 30 unique connections is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verify with an Alternative Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEven though the Total Degrees Method worked, I want to ensure the solution is robust by trying another strategy. Maybe the **Graph Theory Approach** would help confirm the answer.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Vertices and Edges:** Model the switches as vertices and connections as edges.\n  \n- **Regular Graph Concept:** Since each switch has the same number of connections (degree), this is a **3-regular graph**.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nIn a **k-regular graph** with \\( n \\) vertices, the number of edges \\( E \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{n \\times k}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) = number of vertices (switches) = 20\n- \\( k \\) = degree of each vertex (connections per switch) = 3\n- The division by 2 accounts for each edge being counted twice.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{20 \\times 3}{2} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis alternative method also yields 30 connections, which confirms the result from the Total Degrees Method.\n\n**Check:**\n\nBoth methods agree on the number of connections\u201430. This consistency adds confidence to the solution's correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the result using multiple approaches, I\u2019m confident that the number of connections necessary is **30**.\n\nThroughout the process, I:\n\n- **Brainstormed** and initially attempted the Total Degrees Method.\n- **Reflected** and recognized the need to adjust for overcounting.\n- **Checked** my work to ensure the calculations made sense.\n- **Verified** the result using an alternative approach (Graph Theory).\n\nThis step-by-step exploration, with constant reflection and verification, led to a robust and accurate solution.",
