The fourth side is against a barn that's 400 feet long. So, it's not a complete rectangle being fenced.\n  \n- **Given Costs:** The fence costs $5 per foot, and the total budget for the fence is $1,200. This gives me a constraint on the total length of the fence used.\n\n- **Objective:** I need to find the length of the side parallel to the barn that maximizes the area of the pasture.\n\n- **Reminds Me Of:** This seems similar to optimization problems involving rectangles where one side is fixed, and I'm trying to maximize the area using given constraints.\n\n- **Initial Confusion:** At first, I'm not entirely sure how the cost and the lengths are interrelated. How does the budget affect the lengths of the sides?\n\nOkay, let's brainstorm various strategies to tackle this.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Straightforward Algebraic Approach:** Use algebra to set up equations based on the given costs and constraints.\n\n2. **Use of Quadratic Functions:** Since we're maximizing an area, perhaps setting up an area function and finding its maximum using calculus.\n\n3. **Graphical Method:** Visualizing the problem to see how the lengths relate and to find the maximum area visually.\n\n4. **Trial and Error with Reasoning:** Trying out different lengths to see which one maximizes the area while staying within the budget.\n\n**Reflection:** The algebraic approach seems like a solid starting point. If it gets too complicated, I can switch to using quadratic functions or even graphical methods.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Problem Mathematically**\n\nLet\u2019s start by defining the variables:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the length of the side parallel to the barn.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the length of the other two sides.\n\n**Given:**\n\n1. **Total Length of Fence Used:**\n   Since the pasture is rectangular and only three sides need fencing:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total fenced length} = x + 2y\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost Constraint:**\n   The fence costs $5 per foot, and the total budget is $1,200, so:\n   \\[\n   5(x + 2y) = 1,200\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this:\n   \\[\n   x + 2y = \\frac{1,200}{5} = 240\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:** This equation relates \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) based on the budget. It's essential for ensuring the cost constraint is met.\n\n3. **Objective Function:**\n   We want to maximize the area \\( A \\) of the rectangle:\n   \\[\n   A = x \\times y\n   \\]\n   \n   **Realization:** To maximize \\( A \\), I'll need to express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) using the budget constraint.\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing \\( y \\) in Terms of \\( x \\)**\n\nFrom the cost constraint equation:\n\\[\nx + 2y = 240\n\\]\nSolving for \\( y \\):\n\\[\n2y = 240 - x\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{240 - x}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Now, I have \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), which is useful for substituting into the area equation.\n\n### **Step 3: Substituting \\( y \\) into the Area Equation**\n\nNow, substitute \\( y \\) into the area equation:\n\\[\nA = x \\times y = x \\times \\frac{240 - x}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nA = \\frac{x(240 - x)}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nA = 120x - \\frac{x^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This looks like a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x \\), which is good because quadratic functions can be maximized by finding their vertex.\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying the Quadratic Function**\n\nThe area function is:\n\\[\nA(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 120x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** The coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is negative, indicating that this parabola opens downwards. Therefore, there is a maximum point (vertex) which I can calculate to find the value of \\( x \\) that maximizes the area.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Vertex of the Quadratic Function**\n\nThe vertex of a quadratic function \\( Ax^2 + Bx + C \\) is given by:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{B}{2A}\n\\]\nFor our function:\n\\[\nA = -\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad B = 120\n\\]\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{120}{2 \\times -\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{120}{1} = 120\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, the length of the side parallel to the barn that maximizes the area is 120 feet. This makes sense since it balances the cost and area.\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's check if this solution makes sense:\n\n1. **Total Fenced Length Check:**\n   Using \\( x = 120 \\):\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{240 - 120}{2} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60\n   \\]\n   Total fenced length:\n   \\[\n   x + 2y = 120 + 2 \\times 60 = 120 + 120 = 240 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:** This matches the budget constraint, so the solution is consistent.\n\n2. **Area Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   A = x \\times y = 120 \\times 60 = 7,200 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:** The area seems reasonable and is maximized under the given constraints.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Using Calculus to Confirm**\n\nSince the quadratic function method worked well, but to be thorough, let's use calculus to confirm that \\( x = 120 \\) is indeed the maximum point.\n\n1. **Differentiate the Area Function:**\n   \\[\n   A(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 120x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A'(x) = -x + 120\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the Derivative to Zero to Find Critical Points:**\n   \\[\n   -x + 120 = 0 \\implies x = 120\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Second Derivative Test:**\n   \\[\n   A''(x) = -1\n   \\]\n   Since the second derivative is negative, it confirms that \\( x = 120 \\) is a maximum point.\n\n**Reflection:** This calculus approach reaffirms that \\( x = 120 \\) feet is the correct solution.\n\n### **Final Check: Budget Verification**\n\nLet's ensure that using \\( x = 120 \\) and \\( y = 60 \\) stays within the budget:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total fenced length} = x + 2y = 120 + 120 = 240 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 240 \\times 5 = \\$1,200\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Budget} = \\$1,200\n\\]\n   \n**Reflection:** The cost matches the budget exactly, confirming that our solution is not only correct but also practical within the given constraints.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nTo the nearest foot, the length of the side parallel to the barn that will maximize the area of the pasture is **120 feet**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThroughout this problem:\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Explored different strategies and chose the algebraic approach as the starting point.\n- **Thought Process:** Set up equations based on given constraints, expressed \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), and derived the area function.\n- **Calculations:** Found the vertex of the quadratic function to determine the optimal \\( x \\) value.\n- **Verification:** Checked the solution against budget constraints and confirmed using calculus that \\( x = 120 \\) feet maximizes the area.\n- **Reflection:** Regularly reflected on each step to ensure correctness and made adjustments when necessary.\n\nBy aligning our strategies with careful checking and reflection, we ensured a robust and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the sides perpendicular to the barn be of length $x$. Notice that there are a total of $1200/5=240$ feet of fencing. Therefore, the side parallel to the barn has length $240-2x$, so the area to be maximized is $240x-2x^2$. Completing the square results in $-2(x-60)^2+7200$, which is maximized when $x=60$. Therefore, the side parallel to the barn has length $240-2(60)=\\boxed{120}$ feet."
