    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approach, and check my work as I go to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's take it step by step, just like I would if I were tackling this problem on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**User Query:**  \nWhat is the sum of the squares of the lengths of the medians of a triangle whose side lengths are \\(10\\), \\(10\\), and \\(12\\)?\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nOkay, this looks like a triangle with two sides equal (\\(10\\), \\(10\\), and \\(12\\)), which suggests it's isosceles. That might mean some symmetry we can leverage. The question is asking for the sum of the squares of the lengths of the medians.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Median Formula:**  \n   I remember there\u2019s a formula for finding the length of a median in terms of the sides of the triangle. This could be straightforward.\n\n2. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:**  \n   Placing the triangle in a coordinate system might help visualize and compute the medians directly.\n\n3. **Vector Method:**  \n   Using vectors to represent the sides and medians could also work, but it seems a bit overkill for this problem.\n\n4. **Law of Cosines or Sines:**  \n   These laws might help find angles or lengths but aren\u2019t directly applicable to medians unless combined with other methods.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGiven that the problem specifically asks for the lengths of the medians and we have an isosceles triangle, the **Median Formula** seems like the most direct and efficient approach. Let\u2019s start there.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Median Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe median of a triangle is a line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. For a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), the median \\(m_a\\) corresponding to side \\(a\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nm_a = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**  \nWait, does this formula make sense? Yes, it\u2019s derived from the Apollonius's theorem, which relates the lengths of medians to the sides of the triangle.\n\n**Application:**  \nWe have an isosceles triangle with sides \\(a = 10\\), \\(b = 10\\), and \\(c = 12\\). Let\u2019s apply the median formula to find the lengths of the medians.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Medians**\n\n**Calculating Median \\(m_a\\):**  \nHere, \\(a = 12\\), \\(b = 10\\), \\(c = 10\\).\n\n\\[\nm_a = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2 \\times 10^2 + 2 \\times 10^2 - 12^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{200 + 200 - 144}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{256}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 = 8\n\\]\n\n**Calculating Median \\(m_b\\) and \\(m_c\\):**  \nSince the triangle is isosceles, the medians corresponding to the equal sides \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) will be equal:\n\n\\[\nm_b = m_c = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2 \\times 12^2 + 2 \\times 10^2 - 10^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{288 + 200 - 100}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{388}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{388} = \\frac{\\sqrt{388}}{2} =  \\frac{2\\sqrt{97}}{2} = \\sqrt{97}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes this make sense? The medians \\(m_b\\) and \\(m_c\\) are both \\(\\sqrt{97}\\), which aligns with the isosceles property. Quick check: \\(\\sqrt{97} \\approx 9.8\\), and \\(8\\) for \\(m_a\\), which seems reasonable.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet me verify the calculations for \\(m_b\\) and \\(m_c\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{388} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 97} = 2\\sqrt{97}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{So, } m_b = m_c = \\sqrt{97}\n\\]\n\nYup, that checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Summing the Squares of the Medians**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that we have the lengths of the medians, I need to find the sum of their squares:\n\n\\[\nm_a^2 + m_b^2 + m_c^2\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nm_a^2 = 8^2 = 64\n\\]\n\\[\nm_b^2 = (\\sqrt{97})^2 = 97\n\\]\n\\[\nm_c^2 = (\\sqrt{97})^2 = 97\n\\]\n\n\\[\nm_a^2 + m_b^2 + m_c^2 = 64 + 97 + 97 = 258\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, let me double-check the sum:\n\n\\[\n64 + 97 = 161\n\\]\n\\[\n161 + 97 = 258\n\\]\n\nYeah, that adds up correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Checking the Method:**  \nIs the median formula the best approach? Given that the triangle is isosceles, it simplifies the calculations since \\(m_b = m_c\\). Using the median formula is direct and avoids unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes the sum of the squares make sense given the side lengths? The medians should be shorter than the sides but longer than half the sides. With \\(m_a = 8\\) and \\(m_b = m_c = \\sqrt{97} \\approx 9.8\\), this aligns.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nSum of squares being \\(258\\) seems reasonable for an isosceles triangle with these side lengths.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe sum of the squares of the lengths of the medians is \\(\\boxed{258}\\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nBy using the median formula and leveraging the isosceles property, I was able to calculate the medians efficiently. Checking each step ensured accuracy, and verifying the approach confirmed that the method was appropriate for this problem.\n\nThroughout the process, regularly reflecting and checking work helped catch any potential mistakes early, leading to a correct and confident solution.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step walkthrough captures the human thought process effectively, including brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.",

  "ground_truth": "Let us draw our triangle and medians and label our points of interest: [asy]\npair A, B, C, D, E, F;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-6, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nD = (0, 0);\nE = (3, 4);\nF = (-3, 4);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\n[/asy] We have made $AB = AC = 10$ and $BC = 12.$ We can notice a few useful things. Since $ABC$ is isosceles, it follows that $AD$ is an altitude as well as a median, which is useful for finding lengths, since it means we can use the Pythagorean Theorem. At this point, we can drop additional segments from $E$ and $F$ perpendicular to $BC,$ meeting $BC$ at $G$ and $H,$ respectively: [asy]\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-6, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nD = (0, 0);\nE = (3, 4);\nF = (-3, 4);\nG = (3, 0);\nH = (-3, 0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\ndraw(E--G, dotted);\ndraw(F--H, dotted);\ndraw(D + (-0.4, 0) -- D + (-0.4, 0.4) -- D + (0, 0.4));\ndraw(G + (-0.4, 0) -- G + (-0.4, 0.4) -- G + (0, 0.4));\ndraw(H + (-0.4, 0) -- H + (-0.4, 0.4) -- H + (0, 0.4));\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"$G$\", G, S);\nlabel(\"$H$\", H, S);\n[/asy] Since $DC = 6$ and $AC = 10,$ we have a $3:4:5$ Pythagorean triple and $AD = 8$. Since $\\triangle BFH \\sim \\triangle BAD$ and $BF = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB$ (since F is the midpoint of AB), we can see that $FH = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AD = 4$ and $BH = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BD = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot BC = 3.$ $HC = BC - BH = 12 - 3 = 9.$\n\nTo find $CF^2,$ we simply use the Pythagorean Theorem: $CF^2 = FH^2 + HC^2 = 16 + 81 = 97.$ By symmetry, we can see that $BE^2 = 97.$ From before, we have that $AD^2 = 8^2 = 64.$ Our answer is therefore $AD^2 + BE^2 + CF^2 = 64 + 97 + 97 = \\boxed{258}.$"
