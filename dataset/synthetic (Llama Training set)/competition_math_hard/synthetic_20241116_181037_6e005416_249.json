The coordinates of points \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) are given as \\( (12, 19) \\) and \\( (23, 20) \\), respectively. The point \\( A \\) has coordinates \\( (p, q) \\) that we need to find. Additionally, the line containing the median to side \\( BC \\) has a slope of \\(-5\\). Our goal is to find the largest possible value of \\( p + q \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Area Given:** We know the area of the triangle, which is helpful since we can use the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its vertices.\n  \n- **Median Slope:** The slope of the median to side \\( BC \\) is provided. This gives us a crucial condition to work with.\n\n- **Coordinates of \\( A \\):** The coordinates of \\( A \\) are unknown, but since \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are involved, it indicates that \\( A \\) can be anywhere, and we might need to explore different positions.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Area Formula:** I could calculate the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) using the determinants method or the shoelace formula to relate \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n2. **Incorporate the Median's Slope:** Utilize the given slope of the median line to set up an equation involving \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n3. **Combine Both Approaches:** Perhaps use both the area calculation and the median slope condition to create a system of equations to solve for \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\nBefore jumping in, let me reflect. Combining both the area formula and the median slope condition seems like a solid approach. It should provide a system of equations that can help solve for \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculating the Midpoint \\( M \\) of \\( BC \\)**\n\nTo utilize the slope of the median, I'll start by calculating the midpoint \\( M \\) of side \\( BC \\).\n\n**Think About It:**\n\nThe median connects vertex \\( A \\) to the midpoint \\( M \\) of side \\( BC \\). Knowing \\( M \\) will help in determining the slope of the median line.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nM = \\left( \\frac{x_B + x_C}{2}, \\frac{y_B + y_C}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12 + 23}{2}, \\frac{19 + 20}{2} \\right) = \\left( 17.5, 19.5 \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat seems straightforward. Midpoint calculations are generally reliable. Now, I have the coordinates of \\( M(17.5, 19.5) \\).\n\n**Step 3: Setting Up the Slope Equation for the Median**\n\nNext, I'll use the given slope of the median, \\(-5\\), to set up an equation involving \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\nThe slope of a line is given by the change in \\( y \\) over the change in \\( x \\). For the median \\( AM \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{y_M - y_A}{x_M - x_A} = \\frac{19.5 - q}{17.5 - p}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the slope is \\(-5\\), I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{19.5 - q}{17.5 - p} = -5\n\\]\n\n**Checking for Consistency:**\n\nThis equation seems logical. Connecting \\( A \\) to \\( M \\) with the given slope should lead to a relationship between \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n**Step 4: Solving the Slope Equation for \\( q \\) in Terms of \\( p \\)**\n\nNow, I'll solve the equation from Step 3 to express \\( q \\) in terms of \\( p \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{19.5 - q}{17.5 - p} = -5\n\\]\n\nCross-multiply:\n\n\\[\n19.5 - q = -5(17.5 - p)\n\\]\n\nDistribute:\n\n\\[\n19.5 - q = -87.5 + 5p\n\\]\n\nRearrange to solve for \\( q \\):\n\n\\[\nq = 19.5 + 87.5 - 5p = 107 - 5p\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me check this. Adding 19.5 and 87.5 gives 107, which seems correct. So, \\( q = 107 - 5p \\). This linear relationship makes sense and will be useful later.\n\n**Step 5: Applying the Area Formula for Triangle \\( ABC \\)**\n\nNow, I'll use the area formula for a triangle given its vertices to establish another equation involving \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\) can be calculated using the determinant:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B) \\right|\n\\]\n\nGiven that the area is 70, I can set up the equation accordingly.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n\\[\n70 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| p(19 - 20) + 12(20 - q) + 23(q - 19) \\right|\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n70 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| -p + 12(20 - q) + 23(q - 19) \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n70 = \\left| -p + 240 - 12q + 23q - 437 \\right| \\div 2\n\\]\n\\[\n70 = \\left| -p + 11q - 197 \\right|\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n140 = \\left| -p + 11q - 197 \\right|\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\nThis absolute value equation seems correct. I need to keep in mind that it can lead to two separate equations: \\( -p + 11q - 197 = 140 \\) and \\( -p + 11q - 197 = -140 \\). I'll tackle both cases later.\n\n**Step 6: Substituting \\( q \\) into the Area Equation**\n\nSince I have \\( q \\) expressed in terms of \\( p \\) from Step 4, I can substitute that into the area equation to eliminate \\( q \\) and solve for \\( p \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubstitute \\( q = 107 - 5p \\) into \\( 140 = | -p + 11q - 197 | \\):\n\n\\[\n140 = | -p + 11(107 - 5p) - 197 |\n\\]\n\\[\n140 = | -p + 1177 - 55p - 197 |\n\\]\n\\[\n140 = | -56p + 980 |\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, so now I have \\( | -56p + 980 | = 140 \\). This absolute value equation can be split into two linear equations.\n\n**Step 7: Solving the Absolute Value Equation**\n\nI'll solve the equation \\( | -56p + 980 | = 140 \\) by considering both cases.\n\n**Case 1:**\n\n\\[\n-56p + 980 = 140\n\\]\n\\[\n-56p = 140 - 980\n\\]\n\\[\n-56p = -840\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-840}{-56} = 15\n\\]\n\n**Case 2:**\n\n\\[\n-56p + 980 = -140\n\\]\n\\[\n-56p = -140 - 980\n\\]\n\\[\n-56p = -1120\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-1120}{-56} = 20\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, I've found two possible values for \\( p \\): 15 and 20. Now, let's see which of these gives the largest \\( p + q \\ \\).\n\n**Step 8: Calculating Corresponding \\( q \\) Values**\n\nTo find \\( p + q \\), I need to calculate \\( q \\) for each \\( p \\) value using the equation \\( q = 107 - 5p \\).\n\n**For \\( p = 15 \\):**\n\n\\[\nq = 107 - 5(15) = 107 - 75 = 32\n\\]\n\\[\np + q = 15 + 32 = 47\n\\]\n\n**For \\( p = 20 \\):**\n\n\\[\nq = 107 - 5(20) = 107 - 100 = 7\n\\]\n\\[\np + q = 20 + 7 = 27\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me check these. For \\( p = 15 \\), \\( q = 32 \\); adding them gives 47. For \\( p = 20 \\), \\( q = 7 \\); adding them gives 27. Clearly, \\( p = 15 \\) gives the larger sum.\n\n**Step 9: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, it's essential to double-check if both \\( (p, q) = (15, 32) \\) and \\( (p, q) = (20, 7) \\) satisfy all the given conditions, especially the slope of the median.\n\n**Checking \\( (p, q) = (15, 32) \\):**\n\n- **Midpoint \\( M \\) of \\( BC \\):** \\( (17.5, 19.5) \\)\n- **Slope of Median \\( AM \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{19.5 - 32}{17.5 - 15} = \\frac{-12.5}{2.5} = -5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nPerfect! The slope matches the given condition. So, \\( (p, q) = (15, 32) \\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n**Checking \\( (p, q) = (20, 7) \\):**\n\n- **Slope of Median \\( AM \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{19.5 - 7}{17.5 - 20} = \\frac{12.5}{-2.5} = -5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAgain, the slope matches. So, both solutions are valid, but \\( (15, 32) \\) gives the largest \\( p + q \\).\n\n**Step 10: Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying each step, and ensuring all conditions are satisfied, the largest possible value of \\( p + q \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{47}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining the area formula and the slope condition of the median, I was able to set up a system of equations that led to the possible values of \\( p \\). Reflecting throughout the process ensured that both solutions were valid, and checking the slopes confirmed the correctness. Ultimately, the largest sum was found to be 47.",

  "ground_truth": "The midpoint $M$ of line segment $\\overline{BC}$ is $\\left(\\frac{35}{2}, \\frac{39}{2}\\right)$. The equation of the median can be found by $-5 = \\frac{q - \\frac{39}{2}}{p - \\frac{35}{2}}$. Cross multiply and simplify to yield that $-5p + \\frac{35 \\cdot 5}{2} = q - \\frac{39}{2}$, so $q = -5p + 107$.\nUse determinants to find that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{vmatrix}p & 12 & 23 \\\\  q & 19 & 20 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1\\end{vmatrix} = 70$ (note that there is a missing absolute value; we will assume that the other solution for the triangle will give a smaller value of $p+q$, which is provable by following these steps over again). We can calculate this determinant to become $140 = \\begin{vmatrix} 12 & 23 \\\\ 19 & 20 \\end{vmatrix} - \\begin{vmatrix} p & q \\\\ 23 & 20 \\end{vmatrix} + \\begin{vmatrix} p & q \\\\ 12 & 19 \\end{vmatrix}$ $\\Longrightarrow 140 = 240 - 437 - 20p + 23q + 19p - 12q$ $= -197 - p + 11q$. Thus, $q = \\frac{1}{11}p - \\frac{337}{11}$.\nSetting this equation equal to the equation of the median, we get that $\\frac{1}{11}p - \\frac{337}{11} = -5p + 107$, so $\\frac{56}{11}p = \\frac{107 \\cdot 11 + 337}{11}$. Solving produces that $p = 15$. Substituting backwards yields that $q = 32$; the solution is $p + q = \\boxed{47}$."
