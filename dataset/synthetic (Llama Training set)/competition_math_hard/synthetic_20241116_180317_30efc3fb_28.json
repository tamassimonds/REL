    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem like I would if I were working through it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether an approach is correct, check my work along the way, and make corrections as needed. Here's how I would naturally think through it.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's see what we're dealing with:\n\n- **Scenario:** A women's doubles tennis tournament with three teams, each consisting of two women. \n- **Key Detail:** After the tournament, each woman shook hands once with each of the other players **except her partner**.\n- **Question:** What is the total number of handshakes that occurred?\n\nHmm, at first glance, this reminds me of handshake problems I\u2019ve encountered before, where you consider total participants and interactions. But the twist here is that each woman doesn\u2019t shake hands with her partner. This adds a layer I need to think through.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Total Handshakes Without Exclusions:**\n   - Calculate the total number of handshakes if there were no exclusions (i.e., each woman shook hands with everyone else).\n   \n2. **Exclusion of Partner Handshakes:**\n   - Subtract the handshakes that didn\u2019t occur because each woman didn\u2019t shake hands with her partner.\n   \n3. **Direct Approach Considering Exclusions from the Start:**\n   - Only count handshakes that actually happened, taking into account the partner exclusion from the beginning.\n\nWait, I think the **Direct Approach Considering Exclusions from the Start** might be simpler because it directly accounts for the uniqueness of this problem. But let's explore the first two strategies too to be thorough.\n\n### **Strategy 1: Total Handshakes Without Exclusions**\n\nLet\u2019s begin by calculating the total possible handshakes if there were no exclusions.\n\n1. **Total Number of Players:**\n   - There are 3 teams with 2 women each, so total players = \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\n2. **Calculating Total Possible Handshakes:**\n   - If each woman shook hands with every other player except her partner, normally, each player would shake hands with \\(6 - 1 = 5\\) others.\n   - But since handshakes are mutual (if A shakes hands with B, B shakes hands with A), counting handshakes this way would double the actual number needed.\n\n3. **Adjusting for Double Counting:**\n   - To avoid double counting, we can consider handshakes from one side only.\n   \n   **Total handshakes (without exclusions) = \\(\\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15\\).**\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, this seems reasonable if there were no exclusions. But we know each woman doesn\u2019t shake hands with her partner, so I can't stop here.\n\n### **Strategy 2: Accounting for Partner Exclusions**\n\nNow, let's adjust this total by subtracting the handshakes that didn\u2019t occur because each woman didn\u2019t shake hands with her partner.\n\n1. **Handshakes Not Made:**\n   - Each team has 1 handshake that didn\u2019t occur (the handshake between partners).\n   - There are 3 teams, so total handshakes not made = \\(3\\).\n\n2. **Adjusting Total Handshakes:**\n   - **Total handshakes considering exclusions = \\(15 - 3 = 12\\).**\n\n**Reflection:** This seems to make sense. By subtracting the unmade handshakes, we're getting closer to the correct total. But is there a more straightforward way?\n\n### **Considering a Different Approach: Direct Calculation**\n\nMaybe there's a more intuitive way to calculate the total handshakes by directly considering the exclusions from the start.\n\n1. **Calculating Handshakes for Each Player:**\n   - Each woman shakes hands with all other players except her partner.\n   - So each woman shakes hands with \\(6 - 2 = 4\\) others (total players minus herself and her partner).\n\n2. **Total Handshakes Calculated Individually:**\n   - But again, handshakes are mutual, so counting this way would double the actual number needed.\n\n3. **Total Handshakes = \\(\\frac{6 \\times 4}{2} = 12\\).**\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, this matches our earlier result after adjusting for the exclusions. Maybe this direct approach is more straightforward. It skips the initial total and directly considers the exclusions, leading to the same correct answer.\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying the Correctness**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's briefly verify if this approach makes sense:\n\n- **Total Players:** 6\n- **Each Woman Shakes Hands With:** 4 others (excluding her partner)\n- **Total Handshakes Accounting for Mutuality:** \\(\\frac{6 \\times 4}{2} = 12\\)\n\nThis seems logical because we've accounted for each handshake only once by considering mutuality from the beginning.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies:\n\n- **Initial Total Without Exclusions:** 15\n- **Adjustment for Partner Exclusions:** Subtracting 3 (one per team)\n- **Direct Calculation Considering Exclusions:** 12\n\nBoth approaches lead us to the same correct total.\n\n**Final Answer:** **12 handshakes**\n\n---\n\n**Takeaways:**\n\n- **Brainstorming Different Strategies:** Initially considering multiple approaches helped in identifying the most straightforward method.\n- **Reflection and Adaptation:** Re-evaluating the strategies ensured that the solution was correct and efficient.\n- **Final Verification:** A quick check confirmed that the direct calculation aligned with the adjusted total, reinforcing the correctness of the answer.\n\nBy thinking through it step-by-step, checking each part, and being open to changing approaches, I've arrived at the correct solution in a human-like, reflective manner.",
