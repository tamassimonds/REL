They often involve breaking down the equation into different cases based on the definition of absolute value. Since \\(x < 2\\), that might limit how I set up those cases.\n\n2. **Solving for \\(x\\):**  \n   Maybe I can isolate \\(x\\) somehow. But with an absolute value, it's not straightforward because \\(x\\) could be positive or negative relative to 2.\n\n3. **Relating \\(x\\) and \\(p\\):**  \n   Since I need to express \\(x - p\\) in terms of \\(p\\), finding a direct relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(p\\) seems essential. Maybe after solving for \\(x\\), I can easily find \\(x - p\\).\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:**  \n   I should be careful with the solutions, especially considering the condition \\(x < 2\\). This might affect which solution (if there are two) is valid.\n\n### Brainstorming Different Strategies\n\nLet\u2019s brainstorm how to approach this:\n\n1. **Break Down the Absolute Value:**  \n   Use the definition of absolute value to set up two possible equations. Since \\(x < 2\\), only one of these should apply.\n\n2. **Isolate \\(x\\):**  \n   Attempt to solve for \\(x\\) directly by manipulating the equation after applying the absolute value definition.\n\n3. **Substitute into \\(x - p\\):**  \n   Once I have \\(x\\) in terms of \\(p\\), plug that into \\(x - p\\) to express it in terms of \\(p\\).\n\n4. **Verify the Solution:**  \n   Double-check if the solution satisfies both the original equation and the condition \\(x < 2\\).\n\nHmm, let me think... Is there another way besides breaking down the absolute value? Maybe considering a geometric interpretation of absolute value could help, but that might complicate things. I think starting with the algebraic approach is more straightforward.\n\n### Step 1: Breaking Down the Absolute Value Equation\n\nLet\u2019s begin by applying the definition of absolute value:\n\n\\[\n|x - 2| = p \\implies \n\\begin{cases} \nx - 2 = p & \\text{if } x - 2 \\geq 0 \\\\ \n-(x - 2) = p & \\text{if } x - 2 < 0 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(x < 2\\), the condition \\(x - 2 < 0\\) applies. Therefore, only the second case is relevant:\n\n\\[\n-(x - 2) = p \n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nWait a second... does that make sense? Yes, because since \\(x < 2\\), the expression \\(x - 2\\) is negative, so the absolute value would be its negation.\n\n### Step 2: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nNow, let\u2019s solve the equation:\n\n\\[\n-(x - 2) = p \\implies -x + 2 = p \\implies -x = p - 2 \\implies x = 2 - p\n\\]\n\n### Quick Check\n\nLet me quickly check:  \n- If \\(x = 2 - p\\) and \\(x < 2\\), does this hold?  \n  - Yes, because \\(p > 0\\) (since absolute value is always non-negative), so \\(2 - p < 2\\).\n\n### Step 3: Finding \\(x - p\\)\n\nNow that we have \\(x = 2 - p\\), let\u2019s find \\(x - p\\):\n\n\\[\nx - p = (2 - p) - p = 2 - 2p\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nDoes this make sense?  \n- The expression \\(2 - 2p\\) seems valid.  \n- Also, since \\(p\\) is positive, subtracting \\(2p\\) from 2 will give a negative or positive value depending on \\(p\\).\n\n### Step 4: Expressing \\(x - p\\) in Terms of \\(p\\)\n\nSo, \\(x - p = 2 - 2p\\). That\u2019s the expression in terms of \\(p\\).\n\n### Final Check\n\nLet me double-check everything:  \n- **Absolute Value Application:** Correctly applied since \\(x < 2\\).\n- **Solving for \\(x\\):** Correct steps leading to \\(x = 2 - p\\).\n- **Finding \\(x - p\\):** Correct substitution gives \\(x - p = 2 - 2p\\).\n- **Conditions Satisfied:** \\(x = 2 - p < 2\\) holds as long as \\(p > 0\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies and reflecting on each step, the final expression is:\n\n\\[\nx - p = 2 - 2p\n\\]\n\nThis method worked smoothly by directly applying the absolute value definition and solving step by step while constantly checking the validity of each part.",
