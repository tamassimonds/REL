    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it as I would if I were solving it on paper, thinking through different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting my methods along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question:\n\n**_\u201cWhat is the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the point on the \\(x\\)-axis that is equidistant from points \\(A(-2, 0)\\) and \\(B(0, 4)\\)?\u201d_**\n\nMy initial reactions are:\n\n1. **Understanding the Concept**: This reminds me of finding a point that is equally distant from two given points. It sounds like something related to the perpendicular bisector or distances between points.\n   \n2. **Exploring Strategies**:\n   - **Calculate Distances Directly**: Perhaps I can set up an equation where the distances from the point on the \\(x\\)-axis to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are equal.\n   - **Use the Midpoint Formula**: Maybe finding the midpoint between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) could help, but the point needs to be on the \\(x\\)-axis, so I might need to adjust my approach.\n   - **Graphical Approach**: Visualizing the problem might clarify, but I can't rely solely on that\u2014math needs precision.\n\n3. **Possible Challenges**: I\u2019m not entirely sure if the midpoint method will directly apply since the point needs to be on the \\(x\\)-axis. Also, setting up the distance equation correctly is crucial to avoid mistakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\nLet's list out possible methods:\n\n1. **Setting Up Distance Equations**: Let\u2019s denote the point on the \\(x\\)-axis as \\(P(x, 0)\\). Then, the distances \\(PA\\) and \\(PB\\) should be equal.\n\n2. **Geometric Approach**: Maybe considering the perpendicular bisector of the line segment \\(AB\\). The point where this bisector intersects the \\(x\\)-axis could be the solution.\n\n3. **Using Slopes and Intercepts**: If I can find the equation of the line representing the bisector, the intersection with the \\(x\\)-axis might give the desired point.\n\nWait, before I proceed, let me think about which method seems more straightforward. Calculating distances directly seems clear, but perhaps combining it with a geometric approach might make it easier.\n\n---\n\n### **Choosing the First Strategy: Setting Up Distance Equations**\n\n**Step 1: Define the Variables**\n\nLet\u2019s define the point on the \\(x\\)-axis as \\(P(x, 0)\\).\n\n**Thought Process**: By expressing the point in terms of \\(x\\), I can set up equations for the distances to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). If I can find \\(x\\) where these distances are equal, I\u2019ll have my answer.\n\n**Step 2: Write Out the Distance Equations**\n\nThe distance from \\(P\\) to \\(A\\) is:\n\\[\nPA = \\sqrt{(x - (-2))^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(x + 2)^2}\n\\]\nSo, \\(PA = |x + 2|\\).\n\nSimilarly, the distance from \\(P\\) to \\(B\\) is:\n\\[\nPB = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + 16}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**: Using absolute value simplifies the equation since \\(x + 2\\) can be negative. This is important to ensure the distances are always non-negative.\n\n**Step 3: Set Up the Equation for Equidistant Points**\n\nSince \\(PA = PB\\):\n\\[\n|x + 2| = \\sqrt{x^2 + 16}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: This equation looks good. It directly sets the two distances equal, which is what the problem asks for.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Equation**\n\nTo eliminate the square root, square both sides:\n\\[\n(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 16\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**: Squaring both sides should make it easier to solve for \\(x\\). Let\u2019s see if it works.\n\n**Step 5: Expand and Simplify**\n\nExpand the left side:\n\\[\nx^2 + 4x + 4 = x^2 + 16\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Wait, let me double-check this step. Squaring \\((x + 2)^2\\) gives \\(x^2 + 4x + 4\\), and the right side is \\(x^2 + 16\\). Seems correct so far.\n\n**Step 6: Subtract \\(x^2\\) from Both Sides**\n\nLet\u2019s simplify:\n\\[\n4x + 4 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Step 7: Isolate \\(x\\)**\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\\[\n4x = 12\n\\]\n\nDivide by 4:\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**: Alright, \\(x = 3\\). This is supposed to be the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the point on the \\(x\\)-axis equidistant from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). But let me check if this makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Solution**\n\n**Step 8: Verify the Distances**\n\nLet\u2019s plug \\(x = 3\\) back into the original distance equations:\n\nFor \\(A(-2, 0)\\):\n\\[\nPA = |3 + 2| = |5| = 5\n\\]\n\nFor \\(B(0, 4)\\):\n\\[\nPB = \\sqrt{3^2 + 16} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Both distances are equal (\\(PA = PB = 5\\)). This confirms that the solution \\(x = 3\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Geometric Approach**\n\n**Thought Process**: Even though the distance equation method worked, let\u2019s briefly explore another strategy to ensure robustness.\n\n**Step 9: Consider the Perpendicular Bisector**\n\nIn geometry, the perpendicular bisector of a segment is the locus of points equidistant from the endpoints.\n\n**Idea**: Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of \\(AB\\) and see where it intersects the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\n**Step 10: Find the Midpoint of \\(AB\\)**\n\nMidpoint \\(M\\) is:\n\\[\nM = \\left(\\frac{-2 + 0}{2}, \\frac{0 + 4}{2}\\right) = (-1, 2)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: The midpoint is \\((-1, 2)\\). Now, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the slope of \\(AB\\).\n\n**Step 11: Find the Slope of \\(AB\\)**\n\nSlope \\(m\\) is:\n\\[\nm = \\frac{4 - 0}{0 - (-2)} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Step 12: Determine the Slope of the Perpendicular Bisector**\n\nThe slope of the perpendicular bisector is:\n\\[\nm_{\\text{bisector}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Step 13: Write the Equation of the Perpendicular Bisector**\n\nUsing point-slope form:\n\\[\ny - 2 = -\\frac{1}{2}(x + 1)\n\\]\n\n**Step 14: Simplify the Equation**\n\nDistribute:\n\\[\ny - 2 = -\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**: Now, find where this line intersects the \\(x\\)-axis (\\(y = 0\\)).\n\n**Step 15: Set \\(y = 0\\) to Find the \\(x\\)-Coordinate**\n\n\\[\n0 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}x = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Using the perpendicular bisector method also gives \\(x = 3\\). This confirms our earlier solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process**: Since both methods\u2014direct distance equation and geometric perpendicular bisector\u2014yield the same result, I\u2019m confident that \\(x = 3\\) is indeed correct.\n\n--- \n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe \\(x\\)-coordinate of the point on the \\(x\\)-axis that is equidistant from points \\(A(-2, 0)\\) and \\(B(0, 4)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection**: By exploring different strategies and verifying the solution through multiple approaches, I've ensured the answer is accurate. It\u2019s always beneficial to double-check by using alternative methods, especially in geometry and distance problems, to confirm the validity of the result.",

The distance from A is  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(-2-x)^2+(0-0)^2} &= \\sqrt{x^2+4x+4}\n\\end{align*} The distance from B is  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(0-x)^2 + (4-0)^2} &= \\sqrt{x^2+16}\n\\end{align*} Because the point is equidistant from A and B, we set the two distances equal: $x^2+4x+4 = x^2 + 16$. Simplifying gives us $4x = 12$, or $x = \\boxed{3}$."
