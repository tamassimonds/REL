    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were working on it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach is correct, and adjust my methods as needed. I'll try to write naturally, including all my thoughts, doubts, and realizations along the way.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, the problem asks for the integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq n < 31 \\) and \\( 3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\). Then, we need to calculate \\( \\left(2^n\\right)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\).\n\nInitially, I'm thinking:\n\n- This looks like a modular arithmetic problem, where I need to find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 31.\n- After determining \\( n \\), I have to evaluate an expression involving powers of 2 modulo 31.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Find the Inverse:** Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \\( n \\) such that \\( 3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\).\n   \n2. **Calculate the Expression:** Once \\( n \\) is known, compute \\( (2^n)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\).\n\n3. **Alternative Methods:** Perhaps there are quicker ways using Fermat's Little Theorem or properties of exponents in modular arithmetic.\n\n**Reflection:**\nStill, I'm not entirely sure if there are shortcuts here. It might be helpful to start with the inverse calculation and see where that leads.\n\n### **Step 2: Finding \\( n \\) such that \\( 3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\)**\n\n**Approach:**  \nI\u2019ll use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is a reliable method for finding multiplicative inverses in modular arithmetic.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Write the Equation:** I need to solve \\( 3n - 31k = 1 \\) for integers \\( n \\) and \\( k \\).\n\n- **Set Up the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**\n  \n  ```\n  31 = 3 \u00d7 10 + 1\n  3 = 1 \u00d7 3 + 0\n  ```\n\n  From this, I see:\n  \n  ```\n  1 = 31 - 3 \u00d7 10\n  ```\n\n- **Back Substitute to Find \\( n \\):**\n  \n  So, \\( n = -10 \\) and \\( k = 1 \\).\n\n**Checking the Result:**\n\n- **Modulo 31 Adjustment:**\n  \n  Since \\( n \\) must be between 0 and 30, I add 31 to \\(-10\\):\n  \n  \\[\n  n = -10 + 31 = 21\n  \\]\n  \n- **Verification:**\n  \n  Let's confirm:\n  \n  \\[\n  3 \\times 21 = 63\n  \\]\n  \n  And checking modulo 31:\n  \n  \\[\n  63 \\div 31 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\ 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\ 63 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}\n  \\]\n  \n  So, \\( 3 \\times 21 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\) as required.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis matches the requirement \\( 3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\). The inverse seems correct.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\( (2^n)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\)**\n\n**Approach:**\nNow that we know \\( n = 21 \\), we need to compute \\( (2^{21})^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\). This simplifies to \\( 2^{63} - 2 \\pmod{31} \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Simplify the Exponent Using Fermat's Little Theorem:**\n  \n  Fermat's Little Theorem states that if \\( p \\) is a prime and \\( a \\) is not divisible by \\( p \\), then:\n  \n  \\[\n  a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\n  \\]\n  \n  Here, \\( p = 31 \\) and \\( a = 2 \\), so:\n  \n  \\[\n  2^{30} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reducing the Exponent \\( 63 \\) Modulo \\( 30 \\):**\n  \n  Since \\( 2^{30} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\), we can reduce \\( 63 \\) modulo \\( 30 \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  63 \\div 30 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\ 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\ 63 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{30}\n  \\]\n  \n  Therefore:\n  \n  \\[\n  2^{63} \\equiv 2^3 \\pmod{31}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculating \\( 2^3 \\pmod{31} \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  2^3 = 8\n  \\]\n  \n- **Final Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  2^{63} - 2 \\equiv 8 - 2 = 6 \\pmod{31}\n  \\]\n  \n**Checking the Result:**\n\n- **Verification:**\n  \n  Let's double-check:\n  \n  \\[\n  2^{63} \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{31}\n  \\]\n  \n  So,\n  \n  \\[\n  2^{63} - 2 \\equiv 8 - 2 = 6 \\pmod{31}\n  \\]\n  \n  This seems correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\nUsing Fermat's Little Theorem made the exponent reduction straightforward, and the calculations align with the modulo conditions. The answer appears correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Verification of Each Step:**\n  \n  - Finding \\( n = 21 \\) was confirmed by checking the inverse modulo condition.\n  - Reducing the exponent \\( 63 \\) using Fermat's Theorem was correctly applied.\n  - The calculation \\( 2^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\) yielded the correct result.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:**\n  \n  Initially, I considered different methods for finding the inverse and calculating the power but settled on the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and Fermat's Theorem, which proved effective.\n\n- **Mistakes and Adjustments:**\n  \n  There were no major dead ends, but reflecting on the need to reduce exponents helped streamline the process.\n\nOverall, the approach worked well, and checking along the way ensured the correctness of each step, leading to the final answer of \\( 6 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since $21 \\cdot 3 = 63 = 2 \\cdot 31 + 1$, it follows that $21$ is the modular inverse of $3$, modulo $31$. Thus, $2^n \\equiv 2^{21} \\pmod{31}$. After computing some powers of $2$, we notice that $2^5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$, so $2^{21} \\equiv 2 \\cdot \\left(2^{5}\\right)^{4} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{31}$. Thus, $\\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{31}$, and $$\\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 - 2 \\equiv 8 - 2 \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{31}$$Notice that this problem implies that $\\left(a^{3^{-1}}\\right)^3 \\not\\equiv a \\pmod{p}$ in general, so that certain properties of modular inverses do not extend to exponentiation (for that, one needs to turn to Fermat's Little Theorem or other related theorems)."
