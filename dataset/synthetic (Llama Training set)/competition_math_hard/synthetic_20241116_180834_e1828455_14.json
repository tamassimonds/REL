    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, thinking through it just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies, exploring each one, reflecting, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed. I\u2019ll try to capture my thought process, including any uncertainties or \u201caha\u201d moments along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we have a right triangle with integer leg lengths, and it\u2019s called \u201ccool\u201d if the area is equal to twice the sum of the lengths of its legs. The goal is to find the sum of all different possible areas of these cool right triangles.\n\nHmm, right triangles with integer legs... This reminds me of Pythagorean triples, but I don't think that's directly relevant here since the focus is on the area and the sum of the legs.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Use the Area Formula:** Since it's a right triangle, the area \\( A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the legs.\n   \n2. **Set Up the Condition:** The area should equal twice the sum of the legs: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b = 2 \\times (a + b) \\).\n\n3. **Simplify the Equation:** Maybe I can simplify this equation to find a relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n4. **Check for Integer Solutions:** Since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers, look for integer solutions that satisfy the equation.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the condition correctly. The area being twice the sum of the legs seems a bit unusual, but the math should lead me there.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s translate the problem statement into a mathematical equation. The condition given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b = 2 \\times (a + b)\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\na \\times b = 4 \\times (a + b)\n\\]\n\nNow, distribute the 4 on the right:\n\n\\[\na \\times b = 4a + 4b\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging the Equation:**\n\nLet\u2019s bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\na \\times b - 4a - 4b = 0\n\\]\n\n**Factoring the Equation:**\n\nHmm, I wonder if this can be factored. Let\u2019s see:\n\n\\[\nab - 4a - 4b = 0\n\\]\n\nThis looks similar to a factoring pattern. Let me try factoring it:\n\n\\[\nab - 4a - 4b = a(b - 4) - 4(b - 4) = (a - 4)(b - 4) = 16\n\\]\n\nWait a second. Is that correct? Let me verify.\n\n\\[\n(a - 4)(b - 4) = ab - 4a - 4b + 16\n\\]\n\nOh no, I made a mistake in the initial factoring. Let me try again.\n\n**Correct Factoring:**\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to rearrange differently:\n\n\\[\nab - 4a - 4b = 0\n\\]\n\nAdd 16 to both sides:\n\n\\[\nab - 4a - 4b + 16 = 16\n\\]\n\nNow, factor the left side:\n\n\\[\n(a - 4)(b - 4) = 16\n\\]\n\nAh, that\u2019s better. So the equation is:\n\n\\[\n(a - 4)(b - 4) = 16\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, now I have factored the equation. This tells me that the product of \\( (a - 4) \\) and \\( (b - 4) \\) is 16. This seems like a good starting point because I can now think about the factors of 16 to find integer solutions for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding Integer Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince \\( (a - 4)(b - 4) = 16 \\), I can list the pairs of integers whose product is 16. These pairs will give me possible values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Possible Factor Pairs of 16:**\n\n1. \\( 1 \\times 16 \\)\n2. \\( 2 \\times 8 \\)\n3. \\( 4 \\times 4 \\)\n4. Negative pairs, but since lengths can't be negative, we'll ignore those.\n\n**Calculating \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):**\n\nLet\u2019s use each positive factor pair to find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n\n1. **Factor Pair \\( (1, 16) \\):**\n   - \\( a - 4 = 1 \\) \u21d2 \\( a = 5 \\)\n   - \\( b - 4 = 16 \\) \u21d2 \\( b = 20 \\)\n   \n   **Check:**  \n   \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 20 = 50\\)  \n   \\(2 \\times (5 + 20) = 50\\)  \n   **Okay, this works.**\n\n2. **Factor Pair \\( (2, 8) \\):**\n   - \\( a - 4 = 2 \\) \u21d2 \\( a = 6 \\)\n   - \\( b - 4 = 8 \\) \u21d2 \\( b = 12 \\)\n\n   **Check:**  \n   \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 12 = 36\\)  \n   \\(2 \\times (6 + 12) = 36\\)  \n   **Okay, this works too.**\n\n3. **Factor Pair \\( (4, 4) \\):**\n   - \\( a - 4 = 4 \\) \u21d2 \\( a = 8 \\)\n   - \\( b - 4 = 4 \\) \u21d2 \\( b = 8 \\)\n\n   **Check:**  \n   \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 8 = 32\\)  \n   \\(2 \\times (8 + 8) = 32\\)  \n   **This works as well.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAll three pairs yield valid integer solutions for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). I\u2019ll sum the areas corresponding to these triangles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Areas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the integer leg lengths \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) for each cool triangle, I can calculate the areas.\n\n**Calculating Each Area:**\n\n1. **Triangle with \\( a = 5 \\), \\( b = 20 \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 20 = 50\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Triangle with \\( a = 6 \\), \\( b = 12 \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 12 = 36\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Triangle with \\( a = 8 \\), \\( b = 8 \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 8 = 32\n   \\]\n\n**Checking Areas:**\n\nLet me quickly verify if these areas satisfy the original condition:\n\n- For all three triangles, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b \\) equals \\( 2 \\times (a + b) \\). \n- This confirms that all three areas are correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, before proceeding, I should check if I\u2019ve considered all possible factor pairs and whether additional solutions might exist.\n\n**Reconsidering Factor Pairs:**\n\nI only considered positive integers because leg lengths must be positive. Negative pairs would lead to negative leg lengths, which aren\u2019t valid.\n\nAdditionally, since \\( (a - 4)(b - 4) = 16 \\), and 16 only has a limited number of positive factor pairs, I\u2019ve exhausted all possible integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Summing the Different Possible Areas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of all the different possible areas of these cool right triangles.\n\n**Listing the Unique Areas:**\n\nFrom the calculations:\n\n- Area = 50\n- Area = 36\n- Area = 32\n\nWait, are there any other areas I need to consider? Let me double-check.\n\n**Checking for Duplicate Areas:**\n\nI believe each factor pair yields a unique area since the multiplication is commutative, and I\u2019ve listed each distinct pair.\n\n**Calculating the Sum:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of Areas} = 50 + 36 + 32 = 118\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI\u2019ve considered all possible integer leg lengths that satisfy the cool condition and calculated their corresponding areas. The sum seems correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nAdding up:  \n\\( 50 + 36 = 86 \\)  \n\\( 86 + 32 = 118 \\)  \n**That checks out.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let me ensure that all steps are correct and that no solutions were overlooked.\n\n**Verifying the Equation:**\n\nThe original equation was:\n\n\\[\n(a - 4)(b - 4) = 16\n\\]\n\nI factored it correctly, and the integer solutions I found satisfy this equation.\n\n**Confirming Integer Solutions:**\n\nEach pair of \\( (a, b) \\) derived from the factor pairs of 16 satisfies the condition for cool right triangles.\n\n**Rechecking Areas:**\n\nAll calculated areas are correct and satisfy the original condition.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nI\u2019m confident that the sum of all different possible areas of cool right triangles is **118**. The step-by-step approach ensured that all solutions were considered, and multiple checks validated the correctness of each stage.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n**118**\n\n---\n\nAlright, that\u2019s how I would approach and solve this problem step by step, reflecting and checking my work along the way to ensure accuracy.",
