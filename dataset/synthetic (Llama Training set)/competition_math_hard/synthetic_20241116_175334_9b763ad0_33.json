    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a human thought process with brainstorming, exploring various strategies, reflecting, and checking along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n\"A number is chosen at random from the set of consecutive natural numbers {1, 2, 3, ..., 24}. What is the probability that the number chosen is a factor of 4!? Express your answer as a common fraction.\"\n\nMy initial reactions are:\n\n1. **Understanding the Components**: \n   - There's a set of consecutive natural numbers from 1 to 24.\n   - I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen number from this set is a factor of \\(4!\\).\n\n2. **Familiar Concepts**: \n   - Probability typically involves favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes.\n   - \\(4!\\) (factorial) is a concept I'm familiar with, but I need to recall its value and identify its factors.\n\n3. **Possible Strategies**:\n   - **Calculate \\(4!\\)**: Determine what \\(4!\\) is to know which numbers are its factors.\n   - **List Factors**: Once \\(4!\\) is known, list all its factors within the range of 1 to 24.\n   - **Determine Probability**: Use the number of favorable outcomes (factors of \\(4!\\) that are \u2264 24) over the total outcomes (24).\n\n4. **Brainstorming**:\n   - Maybe there's a quick way to find factors or perhaps a pattern I can recognize.\n   - I'm uncertain if listing all factors manually is the best approach or if there's a more efficient method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate \\(4!\\)**\n\nOkay, let me start by calculating \\(4!\\) to know what I'm working with.\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4! = 24\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Alright, so \\(4!\\) equals 24. That makes sense since the factorial function multiplies all positive integers up to the given number. This is helpful because now I know I'm looking for factors of 24 within the set {1, 2, ..., 24}.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify Factors of 24**\n\nNext, I need to identify which numbers in the range 1 to 24 are factors of 24.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Factors of } 24 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- I remember that factors are numbers that divide 24 without leaving a remainder.\n- Listing them out: 1, 2, and 3 multiply with other numbers to reach 24. I can continue this until I've found all unique multipliers.\n- Alternatively, I could think about prime factorization: \\(24 = 2^3 \\times 3^1\\). This helps in identifying all combinations of primes that multiply to 24.\n\n**Check**: Let me quickly verify:\n- \\(1 \\times 24 = 24\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\)\n- \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\)\n\nAll pairs multiply to 24, so the factors listed are correct.\n\n**Reflection**: It seems straightforward to list the factors, and prime factorization confirms it. No apparent mistakes here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Count the Total Number of Favorable Outcomes**\n\nNow that I have the factors of 24, I need to count how many of these are in the set {1, 2, ..., 24}.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable outcomes} = 8 \\text{ (factors: } 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\\text{)}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- Each factor is a possible favorable outcome.\n- Since all factors are within 1 to 24, I don't need to exclude any.\n\n**Check**: Did I miss any factors? Nope, I can see all factors listed are \u2264 24. The prime factorization method also aligns with this.\n\n**Reflection**: Counting the factors directly seems accurate. No need for alternative counting methods here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Total Number of Possible Outcomes**\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is simply the size of the original set.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = 24\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- The set is {1, 2, ..., 24}, so there are 24 natural numbers in total.\n- No complications here.\n\n**Check**: Just to be sure, counting the elements in the set gives 24. Verified.\n\n**Reflection**: This part is straightforward. Confirming the total is essential for calculating probability.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Probability**\n\nNow, I'll calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{8}{24}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- Simplifying the fraction makes it easier to understand.\n- Divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 8.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{24} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Simplifying to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) seems correct. I've double-checked that both 8 and 24 can be divided by 8.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verify the Approach**\n\nLet's reflect on the entire process to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n1. **Calculating \\(4!\\)**: Correctly calculated as 24.\n2. **Identifying Factors of 24**: Factors listed correctly and checked.\n3. **Counting Favorable Outcomes**: All factors are within the range; count is accurate.\n4. **Determining Total Outcomes**: Set size confirmed as 24.\n5. **Calculating Probability**: Fraction simplified correctly to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n**Final Check**: Everything aligns. The approach is logical, and the calculations are correct.\n\n**Reflection**: Initially, I considered whether there might be a quicker method, like recognizing patterns in prime factorization. However, step-by-step factor listing and verification ensured accuracy. It's always good to double-check each part, especially when dealing with probability questions.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe probability that a number chosen at random from the set {1, 2, ..., 24} is a factor of \\(4!\\) (i.e., 24) is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n**Final Thoughts**: Taking it step by step, reflecting frequently, and verifying each part of the process helped ensure the solution was accurate. It's important to be thorough, especially when working with probabilities, to avoid simple mistakes that can lead to incorrect answers.",

  "ground_truth": "The number $4!=24$ has prime factorization $2^33^1$. A factor of 24 must have between zero and three 2's in its prime factorization, and between zero and one 3's in its prime factorization. Therefore, 24 has $(3+1)(1+1)=8$ factors, and the probability that a number randomly chosen from the given set is a factor of 24 is $\\frac{8}{24}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
