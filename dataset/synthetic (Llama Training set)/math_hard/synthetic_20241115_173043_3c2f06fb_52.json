I remember there are certain techniques\u2014like using algebraic equations or geometric series\u2014that can convert these infinite decimals into fractions. But honestly, I'm a bit fuzzy on which method works best here, especially since there are two different repeating decimals involved. \n\nWhat comes to mind is that this reminds me of problems where you have to sum up infinite series or convert repeating decimals individually before adding them together. But I'm not sure if adding them in their fractional forms separately is the most straightforward approach.\n\nI also think about whether adding them as decimals directly would be simpler, but then I remember that might lead to inaccuracies due to the infinite nature of the decimals. So, probably best to stick with converting each repeating decimal to a fraction first.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Convert Each Decimal Individually:**\n   - Attempt to convert \\(0.\\overline{1}\\) to a fraction.\n   - Then convert \\(0.\\overline{01}\\) to a fraction.\n   - Finally, add those two fractions together.\n\n2. **Use Geometric Series:**\n   - Recall that repeating decimals can be viewed as infinite geometric series.\n\n3. **Direct Addition if Possible:**\n   - See if there's a way to add them together directly as fractions without converting each one individually.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Convert Each Decimal Individually**\n\n#### **Step 1: Convert \\(0.\\overline{1}\\) to a Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI remember that to convert a repeating decimal to a fraction, you typically set up an equation, multiply to shift the decimal point, and then solve for the fraction. Let\u2019s see if that works here.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet\u2019s denote the repeating decimal:\n\n\\[ \nx = 0.\\overline{1} \n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 10 to shift the decimal point:\n\n\\[ \n10x = 1.\\overline{1} \n\\]\n\nSubtract the original equation from this new equation:\n\n\\[ \n10x - x = 1.\\overline{1} - 0.\\overline{1} \n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \n9x = 1 \n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{1}{9} \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\\(\\frac{1}{9} = 0.111111...\\), which matches \\(0.\\overline{1}\\). This seems correct.\n\n#### **Step 2: Convert \\(0.\\overline{01}\\) to a Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThis one\u2019s a bit trickier because the repeating part is two digits long. I recall that the process is similar but involves multiplying by 100 instead of 10.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet\u2019s denote this repeating decimal:\n\n\\[ \ny = 0.\\overline{01} \n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 100 to shift the decimal point two places:\n\n\\[ \n100y = 1.\\overline{01} \n\\]\n\nSubtract the original equation from this new equation:\n\n\\[ \n100y - y = 1.\\overline{01} - 0.\\overline{01} \n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \n99y = 1 \n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \ny = \\frac{1}{99} \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\\(\\frac{1}{99} = 0.010101...\\), which matches \\(0.\\overline{01}\\). This also seems correct.\n\n#### **Step 3: Add the Two Fractions Together**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have both repeating decimals converted to fractions, I need to add them to find the sum.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{99} \n\\]\n\nTo add these, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 99 is 99.\n\nConvert \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\) to have a denominator of 99:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{11}{99} \n\\]\n\nNow, add:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{11}{99} + \\frac{1}{99} = \\frac{12}{99} \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\\(\\frac{12}{99}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{4}{33}\\) when you divide both numerator and denominator by 3. Let me double-check:\n\n\\[ \n12 \u00f7 3 = 4 \n\\] \n\\[ \n99 \u00f7 3 = 33 \n\\] \n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{12}{99} = \\frac{4}{33} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, let me make sure both repeating decimals were correctly converted and added. I think they were, but it's always good to double-check.\n\n### **Exploring Alternate Strategy: Use Geometric Series**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nMaybe there\u2019s an easier way to handle this by viewing the repeating decimals as infinite geometric series. But since I already have a clear path with the first strategy, and it worked out, I might stick with it. Nonetheless, it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s another method available if needed.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nFor \\(0.\\overline{1}\\):\n\n\\[ \n0.\\overline{1} = 0.111111... = \\frac{0.1}{1 - 0.1} = \\frac{1}{9} \n\\]\n\nFor \\(0.\\overline{01}\\):\n\n\\[ \n0.\\overline{01} = 0.010101... = \\frac{0.01}{1 - 0.01} = \\frac{1}{99} \n\\]\n\nThen add:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{99} = \\frac{12}{99} = \\frac{4}{33} \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\nThis method confirms the same result. It\u2019s reassuring that both strategies lead to the same answer.\n\n### **Final Check: Is the Answer Correct?**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI should ensure that \\(\\frac{4}{33}\\) is indeed the correct sum of the two repeating decimals. Let\u2019s briefly revisit each step:\n\n1. **Conversion of \\(0.\\overline{1}\\):** \n   - \\(\\frac{1}{9} = 0.11111...\\), which matches.\n\n2. **Conversion of \\(0.\\overline{01}\\):** \n   - \\(\\frac{1}{99} = 0.010101...\\), which matches.\n\n3. **Addition of Fractions:**\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{99} = \\frac{4}{33}\\), confirmed by both methods.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The answer \\(\\frac{4}{33}\\) feels right given the conversions and the addition process. It\u2019s always good to verify each step to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with infinite decimals.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nExpressing \\(0.\\overline{1} + 0.\\overline{01}\\) as a fraction in lowest terms yields:\n\n\\[ \n0.\\overline{1} + 0.\\overline{01} = \\frac{4}{33} \n\\]\n\n**Final Thought:**\nBy converting each repeating decimal individually and ensuring the fractions were added correctly, I arrived at the correct sum. Exploring different strategies reinforced the accuracy of the result, and checking each step helped catch any potential mistakes early on. Always reflecting and verifying makes for a more reliable solution process.",

(Note that this can be done because there is no carrying involved.)\n\nTo express the number $0.\\overline{12}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $100x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&100x &=& 12&.121212\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.121212\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&99x &=& 12 &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{12} = \\frac{12}{99}$.\n\nBut that isn't in lowest terms, since $12$ and $99$ share a common factor of $3$. We can reduce $\\frac{12}{99}$ to $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{33}}$, which is in lowest terms."
