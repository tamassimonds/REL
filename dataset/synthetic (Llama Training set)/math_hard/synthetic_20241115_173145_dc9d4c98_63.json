    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: simplifying \\(\\frac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\). \n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this, I recognize it's a complex fraction\u2014reminds me of similar problems I've tackled before. My immediate thought is that I need to eliminate the imaginary unit \\(i\\) from the denominator to make the expression easier to handle. This approach feels familiar because I've done similar steps with rationalizing denominators in regular fractions.\n\nBut then, a tiny doubt creeps in: \u201cWait, is simply multiplying by the conjugate always the best way? Maybe there's another method I haven't considered yet.\u201d Let me brainstorm different strategies before settling on one.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Multiply by the Conjugate of the Denominator:**\n   - This is the standard method I remember. It should work because it would eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator.\n\n2. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Attempt to handle the real and imaginary components separately. But reflecting on this, I think it might get messy and can lead to mistakes.\n\n3. **Use Polar Coordinates:**\n   - Convert both the numerator and denominator to polar form and simplify. This sounds more advanced and perhaps unnecessary for this straightforward problem.\n\n4. **Long Division for Complex Numbers:**\n   - It\u2019s like polynomial long division but for complex numbers. Seems overcomplicated for what's at hand.\n\nAfter considering these, the **first strategy**\u2014multiplying by the conjugate\u2014still stands out as the most straightforward. However, I\u2019ll keep the other methods in mind in case I run into trouble.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Conjugate Method**\n\nOkay, let's go with the conjugate method:\n\n- **Multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate**:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} \\times \\frac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \\frac{(3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)}{(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection: That seems right. By multiplying by the conjugate, I should eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator.** Let's compute each part.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Denominator**\n\nFirst, tackle the denominator:\n\n\\[\n(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - (4 \\cdot (-1)) = 1 + 4 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check: \\(1 - (2i)^2\\) gives \\(1 - (-4) = 1 + 4\\), so the denominator is indeed \\(5\\).**\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Numerator**\n\nNow, the numerator:\n\n\\[\n(3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) = 3 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot (-2i) + 4i \\cdot 1 + 4i \\cdot (-2i) = 3 - 6i + 4i - 8i^2\n\\]\n\nWait a second\u2014let me reflect here. I remember \\(i^2 = -1\\), so \\(-8i^2\\) becomes \\(8\\). Let's correct that:\n\n\\[\n3 - 6i + 4i + 8\n\\]\n\nCombine real and imaginary parts:\n\n\\[\n(3 + 8) + (-6i + 4i) = 11 - 2i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection: That looks correct. Combining real and imaginary parts seems to have worked smoothly.**\n\n### **Step 4: Forming the Simplified Expression**\n\nNow, put the simplified numerator and denominator together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11 - 2i}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check: Dividing both real and imaginary parts by \\(5\\) makes sense. Let's simplify it.**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\n\\]\n\n**Wait, just to be sure, the division looks clean. \\(11\\) divided by \\(5\\) is \\( \\frac{11}{5} \\), and \\(-2i\\) divided by \\(5\\) is \\(-\\frac{2}{5}i\\).**\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Result**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's quickly verify if this makes sense:\n\n- **Original expression:** \\(\\frac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\)\n- **Simplified result:** \\(\\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\\)\n\nCheck if multiplying back gives the original:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i \\right) \\times (1 + 2i) = \\frac{11}{5} \\times 1 + \\frac{11}{5} \\times 2i - \\frac{2}{5}i \\times 1 - \\frac{2}{5}i \\times 2i\n\\]\n\nCalculations:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{5} + \\frac{22}{5}i - \\frac{2}{5}i - \\frac{4}{5}i^2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{5} + \\left( \\frac{22}{5} - \\frac{2}{5} \\right)i - \\left( -\\frac{4}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{5} + \\frac{20}{5}i + \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{11}{5} + \\frac{4}{5} \\right) + \\frac{20}{5}i = \\frac{15}{5} + 4i = 3 + 4i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection: The multiplication returns the original expression, confirming the simplification is correct.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, I concluded that multiplying by the conjugate of the denominator was the most straightforward approach. I proceeded step by step, carefully calculating both the numerator and denominator, and verified the result by multiplying back to the original expression. \n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\frac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} = \\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\\)",
