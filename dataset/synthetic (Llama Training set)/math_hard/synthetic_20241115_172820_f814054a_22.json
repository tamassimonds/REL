    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect if they\u2019re working, and adjust my approach as needed. Let\u2019s start by really understanding the question.\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, so the problem asks for the product of the numerator and the denominator when the repeating decimal \\(0.\\overline{009}\\) is expressed as a fraction in its lowest terms. \n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Familiarity:** This looks similar to converting other repeating decimals into fractions, which I\u2019ve done before.\n- **Uncertainty:** I\u2019m not entirely sure how a three-digit repeat like '009' works compared to simpler repeats like '0.3\u0305'.\n- **Brainstorming:** Maybe I can use the method where I set the decimal equal to a variable and multiply by a power of 10 to eliminate the repeat?\n\n### **Step 1: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Exploring Different Approaches:**\n1. **Method 1:** Set the decimal equal to a variable and use powers of 10 to eliminate the repeating part.\n2. **Method 2:** Use a geometric series to sum the repeating decimals.\n3. **Method 3:** Convert the repeating decimal to a fraction using known formulas for repeating decimals.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n- **Wait a Minute:** The first method feels straightforward, but I wonder if the three-digit repeat complicates things.\n- **Checking Familiarity:** I've successfully used the first method for two-digit repeats, and the geometric series method might be overkill here.\n- **Decision Time:** Let\u2019s start with Method 1, as it seems the most direct. If it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll try Method 2.\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting Method 1 \u2013 Setting the Decimal as a Variable**\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\nLet\u2019s denote the repeating decimal:\n\\[\nx = 0.\\overline{009}\n\\]\n\n**Want to Eliminate the Repeat:**\nSince '009' repeats every three digits, I\u2019ll multiply both sides by \\(10^3 = 1000\\):\n\\[\n1000x = 9.\\overline{009}\n\\]\n\n**Subtraction to Eliminate the Repeat:**\nNow, subtract the original \\(x\\) from this equation:\n\\[\n1000x - x = 9.\\overline{009} - 0.\\overline{009}\n\\]\n\\[\n999x = 9\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\):**\n\\[\nx = \\frac{9}{999}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Hmm, That\u2019s Interesting:** At first glance, this fraction looks like it needs simplification.\n- **Checking Simplification:** Let\u2019s simplify \\(\\frac{9}{999}\\) by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Fraction**\n\n**Finding the GCD:**\n- **Calculating GCD of 9 and 999:**\n  - \\(9 \\times 111 = 999\\)\n  - So, the GCD is 9.\n\n**Dividing Both Terms by GCD:**\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{999} = \\frac{9 \\div 9}{999 \\div 9} = \\frac{1}{111}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Wait, Is This Correct?** Yes, dividing both numerator and denominator by 9 simplifies the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Simplified Fraction**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Does \\(\\frac{1}{111}\\) Make Sense?** Let\u2019s see if converting \\(\\frac{1}{111}\\) back to a decimal gives us \\(0.\\overline{009}\\).\n\n**Converting \\(\\frac{1}{111}\\) to Decimal:**\n- **Long Division Approach:** Divide 1 by 111.\n- **Calculation:**\n  - 1 divided by 111 goes 0 times (add decimal point): 0.009009009...\n  - **Repeats:** The decimal repeats every three digits as '009'.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Oh! This Confirms It:** The conversion back aligns perfectly with the original repeating decimal, confirming that \\(\\frac{1}{111}\\) is correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Product of Numerator and Denominator**\n\n**Given Fraction:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{111}\n\\]\n\n**Product:**\n\\[\n1 \\times 111 = 111\n\\]\n\n**Final Thought:**\n- **That Was Straightforward:** Once the fraction was simplified correctly, finding the product was a simple multiplication.\n  \n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{111}\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Reflecting on the Process:**\n- **Initial Strategy Worked:** The method of setting the decimal as a variable and using powers of 10 to eliminate repeats was effective.\n- **Simplification Was Key:** Ensuring the fraction was in its lowest terms was crucial for finding the correct product.\n- **Verification Confirmed Correctness:** Converting back to the decimal helped verify that the fraction was correctly simplified.\n\n**Alternate Strategies:**\n- **Thinking Back:** While Method 2 (geometric series) could have worked, it seemed more complicated for this problem compared to the straightforward approach we took.\n- **Lesson Learned:** Sometimes, sticking to more basic methods is more efficient, especially when familiar with the process.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **Everything Adds Up:** The steps logically follow each other, and the verification confirms the correctness of the simplified fraction.\n\nOverall, by brainstorming different strategies, selecting the most straightforward method, and verifying each step, I've arrived at the correct answer: the product of the numerator and denominator is **111**.",
