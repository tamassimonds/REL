    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. When I first read it, I see that it's about a biased coin being flipped five times, and there's an interesting condition regarding the probabilities of getting heads exactly once and twice. I'm trying to make sense of it and brainstorm a few strategies to tackle it.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n- **Coin Flips and Probabilities:** We're dealing with a biased coin, so the probability of heads (\\( p \\)) is not \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). This reminds me of problems involving binomial probabilities.\n  \n- **Given Condition:** The probability of getting heads exactly once is the same as getting heads exactly twice. This seems like a crucial relationship that we can use to set up an equation.\n\n- **Objective:** We need to find the probability of getting heads exactly three times in five flips and express it as \\( \\frac{i}{j} \\) in lowest terms. Finally, we must find \\( i + j \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Binomial Probability Formula:** Use this to express the probabilities of getting heads exactly once and twice in terms of \\( p \\).\n\n2. **Set Up an Equation:** Since these two probabilities are equal, set up an equation to solve for \\( p \\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\( p \\):** Once \\( p \\) is known, use it to find the probability of getting heads exactly three times.\n\n4. **Check Work:** ensure that the probabilities make sense and that the values are correct.\n\nOkay, let's start with the **Binomial Probability Formula**. I remember that for a binomial distribution, the probability of getting exactly \\( k \\) successes (heads, in this case) in \\( n \\) trials is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This formula should help me express the probabilities in terms of \\( p \\). Let me see how that works for getting heads exactly once and twice.\n\n### **Step 1: Probability of Getting Heads Exactly Once**\n\n- **Given:** \\( n = 5 \\), \\( k = 1 \\)\n  \n- **Formula:** \n  \\[\n  P(1) = \\binom{5}{1} p^1 (1-p)^{5-1} = 5p(1-p)^4\n  \\]\n\n**Check:** This makes sense. The binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{5}{1} = 5 \\) accounts for the five different positions where the single head can occur.\n\n### **Step 2: Probability of Getting Heads Exactly Twice**\n\n- **Given:** \\( n = 5 \\), \\( k = 2 \\)\n\n- **Formula:** \n  \\[\n  P(2) = \\binom{5}{2} p^2 (1-p)^{5-2} = 10p^2(1-p)^3\n  \\]\n\n**Check:** Again, the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{5}{2} = 10 \\) is correct for the number of ways to get two heads.\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n- **Given Condition:** The probabilities are equal:\n  \\[\n  P(1) = P(2)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substitute Formulas:**\n  \\[\n  5p(1-p)^4 = 10p^2(1-p)^3\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** This equation looks correct. By setting the two probabilities equal, I can solve for \\( p \\).\n\n### **Step 4: Simplifying the Equation**\n\n- **Divide Both Sides by \\( p \\):**\n  \\[\n  5(1-p)^4 = 10p(1-p)^3\n  \\]\n  \n  **Wait, that can't be right here because** dividing both sides by \\( p \\) assumes \\( p \\neq 0 \\). But since the problem states that the probability is not zero, this should be fine.\n\n- **Cancel \\( (1-p)^3 \\) from Both Sides:**\n  \\[\n  5(1-p) = 10p\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:** This simplifies the equation nicely. I hope I didn't make any mistakes by cancelling.\n\n### **Step 5: Solving for \\( p \\)**\n\n- **Rearrange the Equation:**\n  \\[\n  5(1-p) = 10p\n  \\]\n  \n- **Distribute the 5:**\n  \\[\n  5 - 5p = 10p\n  \\]\n  \n- **Bring All Terms Involving \\( p \\) to One Side:**\n  \\[\n  5 = 15p\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solve for \\( p \\):**\n  \\[\n  p = \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** \\( p = \\frac{1}{3} \\) seems reasonable for a biased coin. The calculations look correct up to this point.\n\n### **Step 6: Probability of Getting Heads Exactly Three Times**\n\n- **Now that \\( p = \\frac{1}{3} \\), use the Binomial Formula for \\( k = 3 \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  P(3) = \\binom{5}{3} p^3 (1-p)^{5-3} = 10 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculate Each Component:**\n  \n  - \\( \\binom{5}{3} = 10 \\)\n  - \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27} \\)\n  - \\( \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{9} \\)\n  \n- **Multiply Them Together:**\n  \n  \\[\n  P(3) = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{27} \\times \\frac{4}{9} = 10 \\times \\frac{4}{243} = \\frac{40}{243}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:** Let's verify the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times \\frac{1}{27} = \\frac{10}{27}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{27} \\times \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{40}{243}\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### **Step 7: Expressing the Probability in Lowest Terms**\n\n- **Given Probability:** \\( P(3) = \\frac{40}{243} \\)\n  \n- **In Lowest Terms:** The fraction is already in its lowest terms since 40 and 243 have no common factors other than 1.\n\n### **Step 8: Finding \\( i + j \\)**\n\n- **Probability in Lowest Terms:** \\( \\frac{40}{243} \\)\n  \n- **Assign \\( i = 40 \\) and \\( j = 243 \\)**\n  \n- **Calculate \\( i + j \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  i + j = 40 + 243 = 283\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** The final answer makes sense. The steps leading up to it align, and the calculations are correct throughout.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming Different Strategies:** Initially, I considered using the binomial probability formula directly, which worked well. Reflecting on whether to simplify by dividing both sides helped streamline the solution.\n\n- **Checking at Each Step:** After finding \\( p \\), I verified by calculating \\( P(3) \\) step by step, ensuring each multiplication was correct.\n\n- **Handling Uncertainty:** At times, I double-checked if cancelling terms was valid, confirming that \\( p \\neq 0 \\) allowed it.\n\n- **Final Check:** Before concluding, I ensured the probability was in its lowest terms and correctly computed \\( i + j \\).\n\nOverall, the process flowed naturally, with constant checks and adjustments, leading to a correct and verified final answer.",

After canceling out terms, we get $1 - h = 2h$, so $h = \\frac{1}{3}$.
