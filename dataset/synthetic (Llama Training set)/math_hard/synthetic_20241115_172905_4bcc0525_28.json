It turns out that this is also exactly enough paint to paint the surface of a sphere. If the volume of this sphere is \\(\\frac{K \\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\), then what is \\(K\\)?\"**\n\nInitial Thoughts:\n\n- **Surface Area vs. Volume:** Wait, the question is about surface area and volume. I'm reminded that the surface areas of the cube and sphere are involved here, but their volumes are also discussed. That\u2019s a hint we might need to connect these concepts.\n  \n- **Equal Surface Areas:** The paint covers both the cube and the sphere, meaning their surface areas are equal. This connects surface area directly to the volumes we\u2019ll later need to calculate for the sphere.\n  \n- **Formula Familiarity:** I recall the formulas for the surface area and volume of cubes and spheres. This could be helpful to set up equations.\n\n- **Given Volume Expression:** The sphere's volume is expressed in terms of \\(K\\) and involves \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{\\pi}\\). It seems a bit specific, which makes me think there might be a geometric relationship at play.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculate Surface Areas:**\n   - Find the surface areas of both the cube and the sphere.\n   \n2. **Set Up an Equation:**\n   - Since the surface areas are equal, set up an equation to find the sphere's radius.\n   \n3. **Find the Volume of the Sphere:**\n   - Use the radius found to calculate the volume of the sphere.\n   \n4. **Express in Given Form:**\n   - Ensure the volume matches the given form \\(\\frac{K \\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\) to identify \\(K\\).\n\nI'm leaning towards starting with **calculating the surface areas** since they are directly equal. But let's reflect if this makes sense.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does Calculating Surface Areas First Make Sense?** Yes, because the amount of paint Joe has covers both surfaces equally. So, finding where these surface areas equal each other is a logical starting point.\n\n- **Potential Pitfalls:** Ensure that when calculating, the units are consistent and that \\(\\pi\\) factors correctly align to match the volume expression.\n\n**Checking Approach:** I think this should work, but I'll keep an eye out for any mismatches in units or constants.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Calculate the Surface Area of the Cube**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start with the cube. I know its surface area is related to the square of its side length. If the side length is 2, I can calculate the surface area straightforwardly.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Surface Area of Cube} = 6 \\times (\\text{side length})^2 = 6 \\times 2^2 = 6 \\times 4 = 24\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\) sounds right for a cube with side 2. This step seems correct.\n\n- **Does this Help?** Knowing the cube's surface area is 24 helps establish the equivalence with the sphere's surface area.\n\n**Status:** Step 1 completed successfully. Surface area of the cube is 24.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Set the Surface Areas Equal**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince the paint covers both the cube and the sphere equally, their surface areas must be equal. Therefore, I can set up an equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Surface Area of Sphere} = \\text{Surface Area of Cube} = 24\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is This Correct?** Yes, according to the problem, both surfaces use the same amount of paint, so their areas must be equal.\n\n- **Next Step:** I need to find the sphere's radius using its surface area formula.\n\n**Checking Approach:** This makes sense because if the surface areas are equal, I can directly solve for the sphere's radius.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Calculate the Surface Area of the Sphere**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI know the surface area formula for a sphere is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Surface Area of Sphere} = 4\\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(r\\) is the radius. Since the surface area is 24, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n4\\pi r^2 = 24\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr^2 = \\frac{24}{4\\pi} = \\frac{6}{\\pi}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{\\pi}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Dividing 24 by 4\u03c0 gives \\(\\frac{6}{\\pi}\\), and taking the square root is straightforward. This seems correct.\n\n- **Does This Help?** Now I have the sphere's radius expressed in a form that resembles the given volume expression. That\u2019s a good sign.\n\n**Status:** Step 3 completed. Radius of the sphere is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Sphere**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the radius, I can find the volume of the sphere using its volume formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume of Sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\n\\]\n\nBut I need to express \\(r^3\\) in terms that match the given volume expression. Let\u2019s compute \\(r^3\\) first.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr^2 = \\frac{6}{\\pi}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr^3 = r \\times r^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\times \\frac{6}{\\pi} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{6}}{\\pi^{3/2}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Multiplying \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\) by \\(\\frac{6}{\\pi}\\) simplifies correctly to \\(\\frac{6\\sqrt{6}}{\\pi^{3/2}}\\). This step seems accurate.\n\n- **Does This Help?** Now I can plug \\(r^3\\) into the volume formula to find the sphere's volume.\n\n**Status:** Step 4 completed. \\(r^3 = \\frac{6\\sqrt{6}}{\\pi^{3/2}}\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Plug \\(r^3\\) into the Volume Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s insert \\(r^3\\) into the volume formula to find the volume of the sphere:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume of Sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\times \\frac{6\\sqrt{6}}{\\pi^{3/2}} = \\frac{4 \\times 6 \\times \\sqrt{6}}{3 \\times \\pi^{1/2}} = \\frac{24\\sqrt{6}}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Simplifying step by step:\n  - \\(\\frac{4 \\times 6}{3} = 8\\)\n  - \\(\\frac{8\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\) matches the given form \\(\\frac{K \\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\).\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, the volume matches the given expression with \\(K = 8\\).\n\n**Status:** Step 5 completed. Volume of the sphere is \\(\\frac{8\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\), so \\(K = 8\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Final Check: Does This Make Sense?**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Reflection on Steps:** Each step logically flows from one to the next. The surface areas were correctly set equal, leading to the correct radius and then the correct volume.\n\n- **Quick Check of Final Answer:** The volume expression now matches exactly with the given form, confirming that \\(K = 8\\).\n\n- **Does This Match the Given Volume Expression?** Yes, \\(\\frac{8\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\frac{K \\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\), so \\(K\\) indeed is 8.\n\n**Checking Approach:** Everything aligns with the problem's requirements and the calculations are consistent.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully walking through each step\u2014calculating surface areas, solving for the sphere's radius, and then finding its volume\u2014I confidently conclude that \\(K = 8\\). Throughout the process, I reflected and checked each calculation to ensure accuracy, adapting the approach as needed to maintain consistency with the given volume expression.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nK = 8\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "Since the cube has six sides, each of area $2^2 = 4$, the surface area of the cube is 24.  Since Joe's paint will exactly cover the cube and it will also exactly cover the sphere, the sphere also must have surface area 24.\n\nIf $r$ is the radius of the sphere, this tells us that \\[ 4 \\pi r^2 = 24 , \\]or $r^2 = 6/\\pi$, so \\[ r = \\sqrt{6/\\pi} = \\sqrt{6}/\\sqrt{\\pi}. \\]Therefore the volume of the sphere is \\[ \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 =\\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\Bigl( \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\Bigr)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot \\frac{6 \\sqrt{6}}{\\pi \\sqrt{\\pi}}\n= \\frac{8 \\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} . \\]Thus $\\boxed{K=8}$."
