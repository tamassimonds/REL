    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process step by step, brainstorming different strategies, checking along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed. It\u2019s important to think out loud, reflect often, and not be afraid to backtrack if something doesn\u2019t seem right.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question:\n\n> Two arithmetic sequences \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) both begin with 30 and have common differences of absolute value 10, with sequence \\( A \\) increasing and sequence \\( B \\) decreasing. What is the absolute value of the difference between the 51st term of sequence \\( A \\) and the 51st term of sequence \\( B \\)?\n\nMy initial reaction is that this involves **arithmetic sequences** (or arithmetic progressions), which I\u2019ve encountered before. It reminds me that the **nth term formula** is crucial here. \n\nI think, \u201cOkay, I need to find the 51st term of both sequences and then find the absolute difference between them.\u201d But then, I wonder, \"Wait, are there any nuances with the common difference or how the sequences progress?\"\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the nth Term Formula:** Recall that the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is generated by adding the common difference repeatedly starting from the first term. This seems straightforward.\n\n2. **Write Out the First Few Terms:** Maybe listing out the initial terms could help visualize the sequences and ensure my understanding is correct.\n\n3. **Check Absolute Value Early:** Since the question asks for the absolute difference, perhaps I can incorporate that to simplify calculations or avoid negative signs.\n\n4. **Alternative Approaches:** If using the nth term formula feels cumbersome, perhaps exploring patterns or using properties of arithmetic sequences might work.\n\nI think the **nth term formula** is the most direct method, but I\u2019ll remain open to adjusting if I run into issues.\n\n### **Exploring the nth Term Formula**\n\nLet\u2019s recall the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\times d\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a_n \\) is the nth term\n- \\( a_1 \\) is the first term\n- \\( n \\) is the term number\n- \\( d \\) is the common difference\n\n#### **Applying to Sequence \\( A \\):**\n\n- **First Term (\\( a_1 \\)):** 30\n- **Common Difference (\\( d \\)):** +10 (since \\( A \\) is increasing)\n\nSo, the 51st term (\\( a_{51} \\)) of sequence \\( A \\) would be:\n\n\\[\na_{51} = 30 + (51-1) \\times 10 = 30 + 50 \\times 10 = 30 + 500 = 530\n\\]\n\n#### **Applying to Sequence \\( B \\):**\n\n- **First Term (\\( b_1 \\)):** 30\n- **Common Difference (\\( d \\)):** -10 (since \\( B \\) is decreasing)\n\nSo, the 51st term (\\( b_{51} \\)) of sequence \\( B \\) would be:\n\n\\[\nb_{51} = 30 + (51-1) \\times (-10) = 30 - 500 = -470\n\\]\n\n### **Checking the Calculations**\n\nLet's quickly check these calculations:\n\n- For **Sequence \\( A \\):**\n  \\[\n  30 + 50 \\times 10 = 30 + 500 = 530\n  \\]\n  This seems correct.\n\n- For **Sequence \\( B \\):**\n  \\[\n  30 - 500 = -470\n  \\]\n  This also looks correct.\n\n### **Calculating the Absolute Difference**\n\nNow, to find the absolute value of the difference between the 51st terms of both sequences:\n\n\\[\n|a_{51} - b_{51}| = |530 - (-470)| = |530 + 470| = |1000| = 1000\n\\]\n\n### **Reflecting on the Approach**\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cDoes this make sense?\u201d The absolute difference being 1000 feels reasonable considering the common differences are both 10 and we're looking at the 51st term. \n\nI briefly consider whether I\u2019ve mishandled the signs, especially since \\( B \\) is decreasing, but checking the calculations reassures me that it's correct.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Verifying by Writing Out Terms**\n\nJust to be extra sure, I decide to write out the first few terms of both sequences:\n\n#### **Sequence \\( A \\):**\n\n- \\( 30 \\) (first term)\n- \\( 30 + 10 = 40 \\)\n- \\( 40 + 10 = 50 \\)\n- \\( 50 + 10 = 60 \\)\n- ...\n- Continuing this pattern up to the 51st term.\n\n#### **Sequence \\( B \\):**\n\n- \\( 30 \\) (first term)\n- \\( 30 - 10 = 20 \\)\n- \\( 20 - 10 = 10 \\)\n- \\( 10 - 10 = 0 \\)\n- ...\n- Continuing this pattern up to the 51st term.\n\nLooking at the patterns, I notice that sequence \\( B \\) likely dips into the negatives, which aligns with our earlier calculation of \\( b_{51} = -470 \\).\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, I check:\n\n- **Consistency:** Both sequences start with 30 and have common differences of \u00b110, so the calculations should align with that structure.\n- **Absolute Value:** The question asks for the absolute value of the difference, so the negative sign in \\( b_{51} \\) is correctly handled by taking the absolute value in the final step.\n\nEverything seems to check out.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying calculations, and reflecting on the approach, the absolute value of the difference between the 51st term of sequence \\( A \\) and the 51st term of sequence \\( B \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step process, including brainstorming, checking, and reflecting, ensures the solution is both correct and well-understood.",

  "ground_truth": "The $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence whose first term is $a_1$ and whose common difference is $d$ is $a_n=a_1+d(n-1)$.  Therefore, the $n$th term of $A$ is $30+10(n-1)$, and the $n$th term of $B$ is $30-10(n-1)$.  Therefore, the positive difference between the $n$th term of $A$ and the $n$th term of $B$ is $30+10(n-1)-[30-10(n-1)]=20(n-1)$.  Substituting $n=51$, we find that the positive difference between the 51st terms of $A$ and $B$ is $\\boxed{1000}$."
