    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem **step by step**, thinking through it just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work, and be open to adjusting my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's treat this like a real human problem-solving process, complete with initial thoughts, confusion, and \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Ideas**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I notice it's about converting rectangular coordinates \\((x, y, z)\\) to cylindrical coordinates \\((r, \\theta, z)\\). This reminds me of 3D geometry problems I've encountered before. Cylindrical coordinates typically involve a radial component in the \\(xy\\)-plane, an angular component (\\(\\theta\\)), and the vertical component \\(z\\) remaining the same as in rectangular coordinates.\n\nBut honestly, I'm a bit hazy on the exact formulas. I remember that \\(r\\) relates to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and \\(\\theta\\) involves arctangent, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I need to look it up or recall from memory.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Standard Conversion Formulas:**\n   - Recall that \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\) and \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{y}{x})\\).\n   \n2. **Visualizing the Problem:**\n   - Imagine the point in 3D space and how cylindrical coordinates represent it differently.\n   \n3. **Checking Bounds for \\(\\theta\\):**\n   - Ensure that \\(\\theta\\) falls within the range \\(0 \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI think starting with the standard conversion formulas makes the most sense. If I get stuck or something seems off, I can always adjust my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating \\(r\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find \\(r\\), I need to consider only the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components of the rectangular coordinates. The formula is:\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n\\]\n\n**Given:**\n\n\\(x = -2\\)  \n\\(y = -2\\sqrt{3}\\)  \n\\(z = -1\\) (Note: \\(z\\) remains the same in cylindrical coordinates)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2\\sqrt{3})^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{4 + 4 \\times 3}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{4 + 12}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{16}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat seems right. The \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components yield an \\(r\\) of 4. Since \\(r > 0\\), this checks out.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nWait, does \\(r = 4\\) make sense given the coordinates? Yes, because the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) values are large enough to produce that magnitude.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating \\(\\theta\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find \\(\\theta\\). The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\n\\]\n\nBut there's a catch: the arctangent function alone can only give angles in certain quadrants. Since our point lies in the **third quadrant** (both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are negative), I need to adjust \\(\\theta\\) to ensure it falls within \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-2\\sqrt{3}}{-2}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\tan^{-1}(\\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nInitially, this gives me \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), which corresponds to an angle in the **first quadrant**. But since our point is in the **third quadrant**, I need to add \\(\\pi\\) to this angle to get the correct position.\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\pi = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet me verify:\n\n- Adding \\(\\pi\\) shifts the angle from the first to the third quadrant.\n- \\(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\) is within \\(0 < \\theta < 2\\pi\\), so it's valid.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis adjustment seems correct. It's important to consider the quadrant when determining \\(\\theta\\), so adding \\(\\pi\\) aligns the angle with the actual position of the point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Writing the Cylindrical Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\), I can write the cylindrical coordinates. The vertical component \\(z\\) remains unchanged.\n\n\\[\n(r, \\theta, z) = (4, \\frac{4\\pi}{3}, -1)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks good. All components are correctly calculated, and the ranges for \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\) are satisfied.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- \\(r = 4\\) is positive.\n- \\(\\theta = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\) is within \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\).\n- \\(z = -1\\) is unchanged.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(4, \\frac{4\\pi}{3}, -1)}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nOverall, the process involved:\n\n1. **Calculating \\(r\\):** Straightforward application of the formula using \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n   \n2. **Determining \\(\\theta\\):** Required careful consideration of the point's quadrant to adjust the angle correctly.\n\n3. **Verifying Each Step:** Ensuring that each component was calculated correctly and made sense within the context of cylindrical coordinates.\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically and checking each part along the way, I arrived at the correct cylindrical coordinates. If anything had seemed off, I was ready to reassess and adjust my approach, which is key to problem-solving effectively.\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding how to convert rectangular coordinates to cylindrical coordinates!",
