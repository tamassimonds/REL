That makes me think about fractions. I remember from math that a fraction in its simplest form has a terminating decimal if its denominator only has the prime factors 2 and 5. But \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) has 1400 in the denominator, so I need to consider that.\n\nI'm recalling a similar problem where the prime factors of the denominator played a crucial role in determining whether the decimal terminates. This feels like a similar approach might work here.\n\n**Alternative Approaches:**  \n1. **Prime Factorization Method:**  \n   - Factor 1400 into its prime components and see which factors need to be in the numerator \\( n \\) to cancel out any primes other than 2 and 5.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Fraction:**  \n   - Simplify \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) to its lowest terms and analyze the remaining denominator.\n\n3. **Using Multiples of 1400:**  \n   - Consider that if \\( n \\) is a multiple of 1400, the fraction simplifies to an integer, which definitely has a terminating decimal.\n\n4. **Decimal Conversion Insight:**  \n   - Converting \\( n \\) to decimal form and observing patterns or using a calculator for specific examples between 1 and 1000.\n\nI'm thinking that the **Prime Factorization Method** would be the most systematic approach. Let's start there.\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization of 1400**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo understand what makes \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) a terminating decimal, I need to break down 1400 into its prime factors. This will help identify which primes should be canceled out by \\( n \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \nLet's factor 1400:\n\n\\[\n1400 = 14 \\times 100\n\\]\n\nBreaking it down further:\n\n\\[\n14 = 2 \\times 7 \\\\\n100 = 10 \\times 10 = (2 \\times 5) \\times (2 \\times 5) = 2^2 \\times 5^2\n\\]\n\nSo, combining these:\n\n\\[\n1400 = 2 \\times 7 \\times 2^2 \\times 5^2 = 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so the prime factors of 1400 are 2, 5, and 7. For a fraction \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) to have a terminating decimal, any prime factor other than 2 and 5 must be removed from the denominator. In this case, the extra prime is 7.\n\n### **Step 2: Understanding the Requirement for Termination**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFor \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) to terminate, the prime factor 7 must be eliminated from the denominator. This means \\( n \\) must include 7 as a factor, ensuring that the 7 in the denominator cancels out.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nWait a minute, does this mean \\( n \\) must be a multiple of 7? Let me explore this idea.\n\n**Checking This Approach:**  \nIf \\( n \\) is a multiple of 7, say \\( n = 7k \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7k}{1400} = \\frac{k}{200}\n\\]\n\nNow, 200 is \\( 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\). Since there are no primes other than 2 and 5 left in the denominator, \\( \\frac{k}{200} \\) will definitely terminate. This seems like a valid approach.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, to have a terminating decimal, \\( n \\) must be a multiple of 7. Let's proceed with this strategy.\n\n### **Step 3: Counting Multiples of 7 Between 1 and 1000**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that we've established that \\( n \\) needs to be a multiple of 7, I need to find all multiples of 7 within the range from 1 to 1000.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nThe smallest multiple of 7 greater than or equal to 1 is \\( 7 \\times 1 = 7 \\).\n\nThe largest multiple of 7 less than or equal to 1000 is:\n\n\\[\n7 \\times \\text{floor}(1000 / 7) = 7 \\times 142 = 994\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nLet's verify:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\div 7 = 142.857 \\implies \\text{floor} = 142 \\\\\n7 \\times 142 = 994\n\\]\n\nSo, the multiples of 7 from 7 to 994 are:\n\n\\[\n7, 14, 21, \\ldots, 994\n\\]\n\n**Finding the Number of Terms:**  \nThis is an arithmetic sequence where:\n\n- First term \\( a = 7 \\)\n- Common difference \\( d = 7 \\)\n- Last term \\( l = 994 \\)\n\nThe number of terms \\( n \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{l - a}{d} + 1 = \\frac{994 - 7}{7} + 1 = 142\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, does this include all multiples of 7 up to 1000? Multiples of 7 beyond 994 would exceed 1000, so we're good.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, I should double-check whether considering only multiples of 7 covers all cases needed for a terminating decimal.\n\n**Checking:**  \nIf \\( n \\) is a multiple of 7, the fraction \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) simplifies to \\( \\frac{k}{200} \\), where \\( k = \\frac{n}{7} \\). Since 200 only has prime factors 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate.\n\nBut what if \\( n \\) includes other primes besides 7? Hmm, let's think this through. If \\( n \\) has factors other than 2, 5, or 7, those would remain in the denominator after simplification, potentially making the decimal non-terminating. \n\n**Reflection:**  \nYes, any additional primes in \\( n \\) would persist in the denominator after canceling out the 7s. Therefore, limiting \\( n \\) to multiples of 7 ensures the only non-terminating potential (the prime 7) is removed.\n\n**Alternative Thought:**  \nCould there be another way to approach this? Perhaps by examining the condition for termination directly?\n\n**However:**  \nThat might complicate things. The straightforward path is to stick with the multiples of 7 since we've confirmed it aligns with the termination condition.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Confirmation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet me wrap this up by ensuring that all steps logically lead to the correct answer and that there are no oversights.\n\n**Final Check:**  \n- **Prime Factorization:** Confirmed 1400 is \\( 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\).\n- **Termination Condition:** For \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) to terminate, \\( n \\) must cancel out the 7 in the denominator.\n- **Counting Multiples of 7:** Found 142 multiples of 7 between 1 and 1000.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything seems consistent. By requiring \\( n \\) to be a multiple of 7, we've ensured that \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) has a terminating decimal.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Number of integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 1000 for which \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) terminates:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{142}\n\\]\n\nBy following this step-by-step approach, starting from understanding the problem and exploring different strategies to verifying each step, we've arrived at the correct solution. This method ensures clarity and correctness, reflecting a natural human thought process, including brainstorming, reflection, and periodic checks.",
