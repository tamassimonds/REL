    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, checking my work often, and reflecting on whether each step makes sense. Let's keep it natural, including any mistakes or insights along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, I see the function \\( f(x) \\) is defined in pieces:\n\n\\[\nf(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n2x^2 - 3 & \\text{if } x \\le 2, \\\\\nax + 4 & \\text{if } x > 2.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThe problem asks for the value of \\( a \\) that makes the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) continuous. \n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- **Continuity at \\( x = 2 \\):** Since the function is piecewise, continuity at \\( x = 2 \\) means the two pieces must meet at this point. So, \\( f(2) \\) from the left side should equal \\( f(2) \\) from the right side.\n- **Finding \\( a \\):** I need to determine \\( a \\) such that this condition is satisfied.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Set the Two Expressions Equal at \\( x = 2 \\):** This seems straightforward. If the function is continuous, the values from both pieces at \\( x = 2 \\) should be equal.\n2. **Check for Consistency in Slopes:** Maybe look at derivatives to see if the slopes match, ensuring not just continuity but also differentiability. But since the problem only asks for continuity, this might be overkill.\n3. **Graphical Approach:** Visualizing the graph might help, but it's not practical without plotting tools here.\n4. **Test Different Values of \\( a \\):** This could be time-consuming and imprecise, so I'll stick with setting the expressions equal.\n\n**Deciding on an Approach:**\nThe first strategy\u2014setting the two expressions equal at \\( x = 2 \\)\u2014seems the most direct and appropriate for ensuring continuity. Let's go with that.\n\n### **Step 1: Set the Two Expressions Equal at \\( x = 2 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Continuity at \\( x = 2 \\) requires that \\( f(2) \\) from both sides are equal.\n- This means: \n  \\[\n  2(2)^2 - 3 = a(2) + 4\n  \\]\n- I'll solve this equation for \\( a \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. Compute \\( f(2) \\) from the left side:\n   \\[\n   2(2)^2 - 3 = 2 \\times 4 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5\n   \\]\n   \n2. Set up the equation for the right side:\n   \\[\n   a(2) + 4 = 2a + 4\n   \\]\n   \n3. Equate both sides:\n   \\[\n   5 = 2a + 4\n   \\]\n   \n4. Solve for \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   2a = 5 - 4 = 1 \\\\\n   a = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n   \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Does it make sense?** \n  - If \\( a = 0.5 \\), then both pieces equal \\( 5 \\) at \\( x = 2 \\), ensuring continuity.\n  - This aligns with the condition that the graph can be drawn without lifting the pencil.\n\n### **Step 2: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I should double-check the calculations to ensure no arithmetic errors occurred.\n- Also, consider whether the approach is complete or if any additional checks are needed.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. Recompute \\( f(2) \\) from the left:\n   \\[\n   2(2)^2 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5\n   \\]\n   - **Correct.**\n\n2. Recheck the equation setup for the right side:\n   \\[\n   2a + 4 = 5 \\\\\n   2a = 1 \\\\\n   a = 0.5\n   \\]\n   - **Correct.**\n\n3. **Reflecting on the Approach:**\n   - **Is setting the two expressions equal sufficient?** Yes, because continuity only requires equal function values at the joining point.\n   - **Should I consider differentiability?** The problem only asks for continuity, so checking derivatives isn't necessary here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The value \\( a = 0.5 \\) seems correct, and the approach is appropriate for ensuring continuity.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Statement**\n\nAfter carefully setting the two pieces of the function equal at \\( x = 2 \\) and solving for \\( a \\), I find that:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.5}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- **Think-Aloud Moment:** Initially, I considered checking for differentiability, but since the problem only required continuity, I realized that was unnecessary.\n- **Mistake and Correction:** There were no arithmetic errors, but reflecting on the need for additional checks (like differentiability) clarified that only continuity was needed.\n- **Checking the Answer:** The solution satisfies the condition for continuity, making \\( a = 0.5 \\) the correct value.\n\nThroughout this process, brainstorming different strategies, consistently checking my work, and reflecting on each step ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",
