    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, simulating a human-like thought process with brainstorming, reflection, mistakes, and those \"aha moments\" that naturally come up when tackling a math problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Given Equations:**  \n  \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = 3\\)  \n  \\(\\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{y} = -7\\)  \n  \n- **Objective:**  \n  Find the value of \\(x + y\\).\n\nInstantly, this reminds me of systems of linear equations, but with fractions involved. I think I've dealt with similar problems before, perhaps by substituting variables or adding equations together. However, it's been a while, so I'm not entirely sure if that's the best approach here.\n\nBut wait\u2014maybe there's a simpler method using substitution or elimination. I'll start by brainstorming the different strategies I can apply:\n\n1. **Substitute and Solve:**  \n   Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and then substitute it into the second equation.\n\n2. **Add the Equations:**  \n   Perhaps adding both equations will eliminate one variable and make things easier.\n\n3. **Multiply to Clear Fractions:**  \n   Multiplying both sides by a common denominator might simplify the equations.\n\n4. **Change of Variables:**  \n   Introducing new variables to simplify the fractions could be another approach.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m leaning towards adding the equations together to see if that leads anywhere. But let me jot down a few quick reflections:\n\n- **Adding Equations:** Adding might work because it could eliminate one of the \\(\\frac{1}{y}\\) terms directly.\n- **Clearing Fractions:** On the other hand, clearing the fractions early could simplify calculations, making addition straightforward.\n\nHmm... Maybe it's worth trying to add the equations first. If that gets messy, I can always switch to clearing fractions. Let's see what happens.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Add the Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI\u2019ll start by adding both given equations to see if one variable cancels out.\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{y}\\right) = 3 + (-7)\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{y} = -4 \n\\]  \n\\[\n2\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + 0 = -4\n\\]  \n\\[\n\\frac{2}{x} = -4\n\\]  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} = -2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a second\u2014this worked out nicely! I found \\(\\frac{1}{x} = -2\\). This feels correct because adding the equations eliminated \\(\\frac{1}{y}\\), leaving a straightforward equation for \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\).\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\n- Adding the equations:  \n  - \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{2}{x}\\)\n  - \\(\\frac{1}{y} - \\frac{1}{y} = 0\\)\n  \n- Result:  \n  - \\(\\frac{2}{x} = -4\\) \u2794 \\(\\frac{1}{x} = -2\\) \u2794 \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nThis seems correct so far. I\u2019ll proceed to find \\(y\\) next.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding \\(y\\) Using \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I know \\(\\frac{1}{x} = -2\\), I\u2019ll substitute this into one of the original equations to find \\(\\frac{1}{y}\\).\n\nLet\u2019s use the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = 3\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\frac{1}{x} = -2\\):\n\n\\[\n-2 + \\frac{1}{y} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y} = 3 + 2 = 5\n\\]  \n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAlright, so \\(y = \\frac{1}{5}\\). This makes sense because adding \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{y}\\) resulted in 3, and \\(\\frac{1}{x} = -2\\), so \\(\\frac{1}{y}\\) had to be positive to balance it out.\n\nLet me check quickly:\n\n- Given \\(\\frac{1}{x} = -2\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{y} = 5\\)\n- \\(-2 + 5 = 3\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\(x + y\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), I\u2019ll add them together to find \\(x + y\\).\n\nGiven:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad y = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\nx + y = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, adding a negative fraction and a positive fraction. I need a common denominator to make this easier.\n\n**Step 3.1: Finding a Common Denominator**\n\n- The denominators are 2 and 5.\n- The least common multiple (LCM) is 10.\n\n**Step 3.2: Rewriting Fractions**\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{5}{10}, \\quad \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3.3: Adding the Fractions**\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{5}{10} + \\frac{2}{10} = -\\frac{5}{10} + \\frac{2}{10} = -\\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, \\(x + y = -\\frac{3}{10}\\). Let me double-check the math to ensure everything adds up correctly.\n\n**Check:**  \n\\[\n-\\frac{5}{10} + \\frac{2}{10} = -\\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\nThat looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\nx + y = -\\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \nLet me verify by plugging back \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into the original equations to ensure everything holds true.\n\n**Original Equations:**  \n1. \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = 3\\)  \n2. \\(\\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{y} = -7\\)\n\n**Substituting \\(\\frac{1}{x} = -2\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{y} = 5\\):**\n\n**Equation 1:**  \n\\[\n-2 + 5 = 3 \\quad \u2714\ufe0f\n\\]\n\n**Equation 2:**  \n\\[\n-2 - 5 = -7 \\quad \u2714\ufe0f\n\\]\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, confirming that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nInitially, I considered several strategies, but adding the equations worked out neatly. By finding \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) first, I was able to easily solve for \\(y\\) and then compute \\(x + y\\). Throughout the process, I checked each step to ensure accuracy, and everything aligns perfectly with the original equations.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's it! The value of \\(x + y\\) is \\(-\\frac{3}{10}\\).",
