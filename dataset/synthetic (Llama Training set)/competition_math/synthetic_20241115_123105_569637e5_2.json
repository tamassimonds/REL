    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and make sure to check my work along the way to ensure everything's correct. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d naturally approach it.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the question is asking for the **average monthly balance** of David's savings account over a four-month period. I see a graph that represents account balances over several months, with each month's balance shown as a filled rectangle.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a bar graph where each bar represents the account balance for a month. Averages usually involve adding up values and dividing by the number of values. But wait, the graph doesn't explicitly label each month with its balance; instead, it uses filled rectangles and coordinates.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** \n    - Maybe I need to look at the heights of each rectangle to determine the monthly balances.\n    - Alternatively, perhaps I can estimate the values using the grid labels.\n    - I could also consider if the graph represents cumulative balances or monthly changes, but it seems more straightforward as individual monthly balances.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Measurement:** If I had the graph in a more precise format, I could use measurements to find exact balances.\n2. **Grid Reference:** Use the labeled grid to read off the balance values.\n3. **Assuming Uniformity:** If the graph is evenly divided, perhaps each bar represents a fixed time period (like a month).\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\n\nLooking closely, each rectangle seems to represent a single month, as they\u2019re positioned sequentially on the x-axis (labeled Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr). So, I\u2019m leaning towards using the labeled grid to determine each month\u2019s balance.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Identifying Monthly Balances**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI\u2019ll check the height of each rectangle corresponding to the months January (J), February (F), March (M), and April (A). The height should align with the labeled y-axis to give the balance in dollars.\n\n- **Checking Labels:**\n    - I see labels at different heights: 100, 200, 150, and again 150. These likely correspond to the y-coordinates of the top of each rectangle.\n\n**Strategy: Grid Reference**\n\nLet\u2019s assign each month its corresponding balance based on these heights.\n\n- **January (J):** The rectangle extends up to 100.\n  - *Thought:* So, the balance for January is **$100**.\n\n- **February (F):** The rectangle goes up to 200.\n  - *Wait, are there two 200s?* Yes, I see that February\u2019s rectangle overlaps with the 200 mark, so the balance is **$200**.\n\n- **March (M):** The rectangle extends up to 150.\n  - *Reflection:* This is straightforward, so March\u2019s balance is **$150**.\n\n- **April (A):** The rectangle is also up to 150.\n  - *Double-checking:* Same height as March, so April\u2019s balance is **$150**.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes it make sense that January's balance is lower than February\u2019s? Yes, since the graph shows monthly balances, it likely fluctuates.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Calculating the Average Monthly Balance**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the monthly balances\u2014$100 for January, $200 for February, $150 for March, and $150 for April\u2014I can calculate the average.\n\n- **Formula for Average:**\n    \\[\n    \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of monthly balances}}{\\text{Number of months}}\n    \\]\n    \n- **Calculating the Sum:**\n    \\[\n    100 + 200 + 150 + 150 = 600\n    \\]\n    \n- **Dividing by the Number of Months:**\n    \\[\n    \\frac{600}{4} = 150\n    \\]\n    \n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the average monthly balance is **$150**. Let me quickly verify each step to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Double-Checking the Work**\n\n**Quick Checks:**\n\n- **Sum Calculation:** $100 + $200 + $150 + $150 = $600. Yep, that\u2019s correct.\n- **Division:** $600 divided by 4 equals $150. This checks out.\n- **Consistency with Graph:** All monthly balances seem reasonable based on the graph\u2019s layout.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\nThe average being $150 makes sense, especially since March and April have the same balance. February is higher, which raises the average a bit, and January is lower, bringing it down slightly.\n\n**Potential Mistake Check:**\n\nWait, did I assume anything incorrectly about the graph? No, because the question specifically asks for the average monthly balance, and the rectangles represent each month\u2019s balance.\n\n**Alternative Strategy Consideration:**\n\nI considered measuring the rectangles directly, but since the grid is labeled, using the y-coordinates is more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy carefully examining the graph and assigning each month its corresponding balance based on the labeled grid, I was able to calculate the average monthly balance accurately.\n\n- **Method Verified:** Using grid references ensures precision, and double-checking the calculations confirms the correctness.\n- **Alternative Methods Not Needed:** Since the grid was clear, no need for more complex strategies like measuring or estimating.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe **average monthly balance** of David\u2019s savings account during the four-month period is **$150**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nDoes everything align? Yes, the average makes sense given the monthly balances, and all calculations are correct. I\u2019m confident in this solution.\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, brainstorming various strategies, and continuously reflecting and checking the work, I've ensured a thorough and accurate solution. This methodical thinking mimics natural human problem-solving, complete with initial uncertainties, checks, and confirmations along the way.",
