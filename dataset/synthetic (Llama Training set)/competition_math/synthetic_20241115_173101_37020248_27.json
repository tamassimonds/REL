    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, emulating human-like brainstorming and reflective thinking. I'll walk through my initial thoughts, explore different strategies, check my work often, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem:  \n\\[ x^2 + 3x + \\frac{3}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2} = 26 \\]  \nand \\( x \\) can be expressed as \\( a + \\sqrt{b} \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers. I need to find \\( a + b \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Factoring or Quadratic Formula:** This equation reminds me of quadratic equations because of the \\( x^2 \\) and \\( x \\) terms. Perhaps I can rearrange it into a standard quadratic form.\n  \n- **Common Denominator:** The presence of \\( \\frac{3}{x} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) makes me think about combining terms using a common denominator to simplify the equation.\n\n- **Substitution:** Maybe substituting \\( y = x + \\frac{1}{x} \\) could simplify things, but I don't see an immediate connection.\n\n- **Exponents or Powers:** Perhaps expressing everything in terms of \\( x^2 \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) might help.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNone of these strategies seem immediately straightforward. Factoring might not work given the mixed terms and fractions. Substitution could simplify the expression, but I'm not sure how to connect it back to the original equation. Maybe starting with simplifying the fractions would be a good first step.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Simplifying the Equation by Finding a Common Denominator**\n\nLet\u2019s start by combining the fractional terms to see if that simplifies anything.\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2} \\]  \nThe common denominator here is \\( x^2 \\). So, let's rewrite these fractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{x} = \\frac{3x}{x^2} \\]  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\]  \n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3x}{x^2} + \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\frac{3x + 1}{x^2} \\]\n\n**Updated Equation:**\n\nNow, substituting back into the original equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 3x + \\frac{3x + 1}{x^2} = 26 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks cleaner. By combining the fractions, perhaps I can eliminate the denominator by multiplying through by \\( x^2 \\). Let's see if that works.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Eliminating the Denominator by Multiplying Both Sides by \\( x^2 \\)**\n\nMultiply the entire equation by \\( x^2 \\) to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[ x^2 \\cdot (x^2 + 3x) + (3x + 1) = 26x^2 \\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[ x^4 + 3x^3 + 3x + 1 = 26x^2 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute\u2014this complicates things by adding higher-degree terms. Maybe multiplying by \\( x^2 \\) wasn't the best move. Let me think about this. Perhaps I should try substitution instead.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Trying Substitution Method**\n\nThinking back, substitution might simplify things better. Let's attempt substituting \\( y = x + \\frac{1}{x} \\).\n\nBut first, I need to express the original equation in terms of \\( y \\). Let's see how \\( y \\) can relate to the given equation.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[ y = x + \\frac{1}{x} \\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[ y^2 = \\left(x + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 = x^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} \\]\n\nFrom this, we can express \\( x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} \\):\n\n\\[ x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = y^2 - 2 \\]\n\n**Applying This to the Original Equation:**\n\nThe original equation is:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 3x + \\frac{3}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2} = 26 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( y = x + \\frac{1}{x} \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ y^2 - 2 + 3y = 26 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ y^2 + 3y - 2 - 26 = 0 \\]  \n\\[ y^2 + 3y - 28 = 0 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks more promising. By substituting \\( y \\), I've transformed the original equation into a standard quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). Now, I can solve for \\( y \\) using the quadratic formula.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Solving the Quadratic Equation for \\( y \\)**\n\nThe quadratic equation is:\n\n\\[ y^2 + 3y - 28 = 0 \\]\n\nApply the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]  \nwhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), and \\( c = -28 \\).\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-28)}}{2 \\cdot 1} \\]  \n\\[ y = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 112}}{2} \\]  \n\\[ y = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{121}}{2} \\]  \n\\[ y = \\frac{-3 \\pm 11}{2} \\]\n\nTwo possible solutions for \\( y \\):\n\n1. \\( y = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\)\n2. \\( y = \\frac{-14}{2} = -7 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAlright, I've found two potential values for \\( y \\): 4 and -7. Since \\( y = x + \\frac{1}{x} \\), both solutions need to be checked to see if they yield valid \\( x \\) values that fit the form \\( a + \\sqrt{b} \\) with \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as positive integers.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Finding Corresponding \\( x \\) Values**\n\n**Case 1:** \\( y = 4 \\)\n\n\\[ x + \\frac{1}{x} = 4 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( x \\) to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 1 = 4x \\]  \n\\[ x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 \\]\n\nApplying the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}}{2 \\cdot 1} \\]  \n\\[ x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} \\]  \n\\[ x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2} \\]  \n\\[ x = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\]  \n\\[ x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, \\( x = 2 + \\sqrt{3} \\) or \\( x = 2 - \\sqrt{3} \\). Both solutions fit the form \\( a + \\sqrt{b} \\) with \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\), which are positive integers. This looks promising.\n\n**Case 2:** \\( y = -7 \\)\n\n\\[ x + \\frac{1}{x} = -7 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x^2 + 1 = -7x \\]  \n\\[ x^2 + 7x + 1 = 0 \\]\n\nApplying the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{7^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}}{2 \\cdot 1} \\]  \n\\[ x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 4}}{2} \\]  \n\\[ x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{45}}{2} \\]  \n\\[ x = \\frac{-7 \\pm 3\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis gives us \\( x = \\frac{-7 + 3\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\) or \\( x = \\frac{-7 - 3\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\). However, for \\( a + \\sqrt{b} \\) to be positive integers, this doesn't align because the \\( a \\) value here is negative. It doesn't fit the required form with both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as positive integers.\n\n**Conclusion from Reflection:**  \nOnly the \\( y = 4 \\) case provides valid \\( x \\) values that satisfy the condition \\( x = a + \\sqrt{b} \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Identifying \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)**\n\nFrom the \\( y = 4 \\) case:\n\n\\[ x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nGiven the problem's requirement, let's take the positive root:\n\n\\[ x = 2 + \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nHere, comparing \\( x = a + \\sqrt{b} \\):\n\n- \\( a = 2 \\)\n- \\( b = 3 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis aligns perfectly with the required form where both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers. This makes sense.\n\n---\n\n**Final Step: Calculating \\( a + b \\)**\n\n\\[ a + b = 2 + 3 = 5 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The approach led me to valid \\( x \\) values that satisfy the condition, and the calculations along the way are consistent. The answer makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[ a + b = 5 \\]\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Brainstorming Strategies:**  \n   - Started by considering factoring, finding a common denominator, substitution, and expressing in terms of exponents.\n  \n2. **Initial Approach:**  \n   - Attempted to simplify by finding a common denominator, which led to a complicated equation.\n  \n3. **Reflecting and Adjusting:**  \n   - Realized that multiplying by \\( x^2 \\) complicated things, so shifted focus to substitution.\n  \n4. **Applying Substitution:**  \n   - Substituted \\( y = x + \\frac{1}{x} \\), transforming the equation into a standard quadratic.\n  \n5. **Solving for \\( y \\):**  \n   - Solved the quadratic equation, yielding two possible \\( y \\) values.\n  \n6. **Finding Corresponding \\( x \\) Values:**  \n   - For \\( y = 4 \\), found \\( x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3} \\).\n   - For \\( y = -7 \\), the solutions didn't fit the required form.\n  \n7. **Identifying \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):**  \n   - Determined \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\) from \\( x = 2 + \\sqrt{3} \\).\n  \n8. **Calculating \\( a + b \\):**  \n   - Summed \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to get the final answer: 5.\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected frequently to ensure each step made sense, adjusted strategies when initial approaches didn't work, and verified solutions to confirm correctness. This human-like thinking approach helped navigate the problem effectively.\n\n---",

  "ground_truth": "Let $k = x+\\frac 1x$. Notice that $k^2 = x^2 + 2 + \\frac 1{x^2}$, so $x^2 + \\frac 1{x^2} = k^2-2$. Substituting this into the equation gives $(k^2-2) + 3 \\cdot (k) = 26$, or $k^2 + 3k - 28 = (k+7)(k-4) = 0$. Since $x$ is positive, then $k > 0$, so $k = 4$.
