    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorm different strategies, and explore various methods to find the number of different 7-unit paths from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) on the given grid. \n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nLooking at the problem, my initial reaction is to think about the different ways to arrange a sequence of moves on a grid. This reminds me of combinatorial path problems I've encountered before. But let me jot down my thoughts to see if this aligns with a known strategy or if I need to explore further.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Combinatorial Paths:** Maybe I can use combinations to calculate the number of unique sequences of moves.\n- **Grid Restrictions:** Since we must stay on the grid, I need to ensure my path doesn't go outside the boundaries.\n- **Total Moves:** A 7-unit path suggests a specific number of steps, which might relate to the dimensions of the grid.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Counting Distinct Sequences:** Calculate the number of distinct sequences of horizontal and vertical moves.\n2. **Path Length Constraints:** Ensure the total number of moves is 7 units.\n3. **Grid Boundaries:** Make sure the path stays within the grid limits.\n\nAt this point, I think exploring the **Counting Distinct Sequences** approach might be a good starting point. If it doesn't lead me to the correct solution, I'll pivot to another strategy.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Grid**\n\nBefore jumping into calculations, let me visualize the grid and the starting and ending points.\n\n- **Grid Size:** The diagram shows a grid with \\( w \\times h \\) blocks, where \\( w = 5 \\) and \\( h = 4 \\).\n- **Start Point \\( A \\):** Located at the bottom-left corner \\( (0,0) \\).\n- **End Point \\( B \\):** Located at the top-right corner \\( (4,3) \\).\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, so the grid has 5 vertical lines and 4 horizontal lines, making a total of 20 unit blocks. That gives me a sense of the available paths.\n\n### **Step 2: Total Moves Breakdown**\n\nTo reach \\( B \\) from \\( A \\), I need to make a total of 7 moves. Let's think about the types of moves possible:\n\n- **Horizontal (Right) Moves:** Moving from \\( (x,y) \\) to \\( (x+1,y) \\).\n- **Vertical (Up) Moves:** Moving from \\( (x,y) \\) to \\( (x,y+1) \\).\n\nGiven that \\( A \\) is at \\( (0,0) \\) and \\( B \\) is at \\( (4,3) \\), I need to move:\n\n- **4 units to the right** (from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = 4 \\))\n- **3 units up** (from \\( y = 0 \\) to \\( y = 3 \\))\n\n**Thought Process:** Wait, if I need a total of 7 moves (4 right + 3 up), that satisfies the requirement. But let's check if this aligns with the grid size. The grid goes from \\( (0,0) \\) to \\( (4,3) \\), so moving 4 units right and 3 units up fits perfectly within the grid.\n\n**Check:** Yes, the total number of required moves matches the path length constraint.\n\n### **Step 3: Counting Distinct Sequences**\n\nNow, I need to calculate the number of distinct sequences of these moves. This looks like a combinatorics problem where I need to arrange a series of 'R' (right) and 'U' (up) moves.\n\n**Formula Idea:** The number of distinct sequences is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of paths} = \\frac{7!}{4! \\times 3!}\n\\]\n\n**Breakdown:**\n- **7!:** Total number of moves.\n- **4!:** Factorial for the number of right moves.\n- **3!:** Factorial for the number of up moves.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of paths} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1) \\times (3 \\times 2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{5040}{24 \\times 6} = \\frac{5040}{144} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Let me pause and check if this makes sense. The calculation seems correct, but I should verify whether this approach covers all possible paths without duplicating or missing any.\n\n**Quick Check:** Since the path must consist of exactly 4 right and 3 up moves, and the grid only allows these two types of moves, combining them in different sequences should account for all possible paths. Therefore, the multinomial coefficient approach seems valid.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, it's essential to ensure that all conditions are met and that the solution is correct.\n\n**Conditions:**\n- The path must be exactly 7 units long.\n- The path must stay within the grid boundaries.\n- The moves must be a combination of right and up, totaling 7.\n\n**Verification:**\n- **Total Moves:** 4 right + 3 up = 7 moves \u2192 Check.\n- **Grid Boundaries:** Moving within \\( (0,0) \\) to \\( (4,3) \\) \u2192 Check.\n- **Distinct Sequences Calculation:** Using permutations to arrange the moves \u2192 Check.\n\n**Thought Process:** This approach logically accounts for all possible unique sequences of right and up moves, ensuring the total path length is 7 and adhering to the grid's dimensions.\n\n**Reflection:** The solution seems correct, but let me consider if there's another method that could confirm this result or highlight any potential oversight.\n\n### **Step 5: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\nTo ensure robustness, let's explore another strategy\u2014visualizing the paths or using a recursive approach to count them.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Recursive Counting**\n- Create all possible move sequences of length 7.\n- Filter those that contain exactly 4 'R's and 3 'U's.\n- Count the valid sequences.\n\n**Thought Process:** This method would provide a brute-force verification, but it might be time-consuming and unnecessary since the combinatorial approach is straightforward and efficient.\n\n**Reflection:** Given that the combinatorial method has already provided a logical and correct solution, pursuing this alternative strategy might not be necessary. However, it serves as a confirmation that the distinct sequences are correctly counted.\n\n**Final Check:** Considering the grid's constraints and the required number of moves, the multinomial coefficient method accurately calculates the number of distinct paths.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming and verifying multiple strategies, the most efficient and logical approach is to use the multinomial coefficient to count the number of distinct sequences of right and up moves.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{35}\n\\]\n\n**Summary:**\n- Explored distinct sequences of right and up moves.\n- Ensured the total path length aligns with the grid's dimensions.\n- Verified the approach using combinatorial reasoning.\n- Confirmed the solution's correctness through alternative strategy reflection.\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, reflecting on each stage, and checking the work regularly, I've arrived at a confident and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We know that we must take a 7 unit path.  If we look at the grid a little more carefully, we can see that our path must consist of 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and we can take those steps in any order.  So in order to specify a path, we must choose 3 of our 7 steps to be `up' (and the other 4 steps will thus be `right').  Hence the number of paths is $$ \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{35}. $$"
