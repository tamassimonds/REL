    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm a bit to see how I can tackle it, reflecting and checking my thoughts along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem is asking me to express \\(\\cos^3 \\theta\\) in terms of \\(\\cos 3\\theta\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta\\), using constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of trigonometric identities, especially those involving multiple angles. I\u2019ve seen similar transformations before, maybe involving the cosine triple angle formula.\n  \n- **Alternative Idea:** Another way is to use power-reduction formulas, which convert powers of cosine into sums or differences of cosine. But connecting that directly to \\(\\cos 3\\theta\\) might get tricky.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I\u2019m not entirely sure which method is best right now. Perhaps starting with the triple angle formula and seeing how it connects could be a good starting point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Triple Angle Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me recall the triple angle formula for cosine:\n\\[\n\\cos 3\\theta = 4\\cos^3 \\theta - 3\\cos \\theta\n\\]\nThis formula directly relates \\(\\cos^3 \\theta\\) to \\(\\cos 3\\theta\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta\\), which is exactly what I need!\n\n**Checking If This Works:**\n\n- **Objective Alignment:** The equation I have is \\(\\cos^3 \\theta = a \\cos 3\\theta + b \\cos \\theta\\). If I can express \\(\\cos^3 \\theta\\) using \\(\\cos 3\\theta\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta\\), then this formula seems like a perfect match.\n\n- **Formula Rearrangement:** Let's rearrange the triple angle formula to match the desired form:\n  \\[\n  \\cos^3 \\theta = \\frac{1}{4} \\cos 3\\theta + \\frac{3}{4} \\cos \\theta\n  \\]\n  Here, \\(a = \\frac{1}{4}\\) and \\(b = \\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does It Make Sense?** Wait, let me double-check this. My goal is to express \\(\\cos^3 \\theta\\) in terms of \\(\\cos 3\\theta\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta\\). By isolating \\(\\cos^3 \\theta\\) in the triple angle formula, I seem to have matched the required form.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Plugging in \\(a = \\frac{1}{4}\\) and \\(b = \\frac{3}{4}\\), the equation aligns perfectly:\n  \\[\n  \\cos^3 \\theta = \\frac{1}{4} \\cos 3\\theta + \\frac{3}{4} \\cos \\theta\n  \\]\n  This matches the original equation structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Confirming the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I\u2019ve identified \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it\u2019s crucial to verify if this indeed satisfies the equation for all angles \\(\\theta\\).\n\n- **Approach:** I could test specific values of \\(\\theta\\) to see if both sides of the equation match. Alternatively, I could check the consistency by substituting back into the triple angle formula.\n\n**Testing with Specific Angles:**\n\n1. **Let\u2019s take \\(\\theta = 0\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\cos^3(0) = 1^3 = 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\cos 3(0) = \\cos 0 = 1 \\implies a \\times 1 + b \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = 1\n   \\]\n   **Match!**\n\n2. **Now, \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\cos^3\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\cos 3\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\cos \\pi = -1 \\implies a \\times (-1) + b \\times \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{1}{8}\n   \\]\n   **Again, Match!**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Verify Correctness?** Both test cases show that the equation holds true. This suggests that \\(a = \\frac{1}{4}\\) and \\(b = \\frac{3}{4}\\) are indeed correct.\n\n- **Potential Oversight?** Might there be other values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that also satisfy the equation? Given that the triple angle formula directly provides these coefficients, it's likely that this is the unique solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nHaving tested specific angles and verified that both sides of the equation match, I\u2019m confident in the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n- **Final Check:** The transformation from the triple angle formula to the desired equation form was straightforward, and multiple test cases confirmed the correctness.\n\n- **Ordered Pair:** Thus, the ordered pair \\((a, b)\\) is:\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{\\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}\\right)}\n  \\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Does Everything Add Up?** Yes, the approach aligns with known trigonometric identities, and the verification steps confirm the solution's validity.\n\n- **Any Alternative Methods Needed?** While I briefly considered using power-reduction formulas, the direct application of the triple angle formula proved to be the most efficient and straightforward method.\n\n- **Mistakes or Adjustments?** Initially, I thought about exploring power-reduction formulas, but recognizing the direct connection via the triple angle formula streamlined the process.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, by leveraging the triple angle formula for cosine and verifying with specific angle cases, I've determined that the constants are \\(a = \\frac{1}{4}\\) and \\(b = \\frac{3}{4}\\). The ordered pair is \\(\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}\\right)}\\).",
