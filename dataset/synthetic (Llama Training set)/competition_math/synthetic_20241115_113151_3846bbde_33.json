    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, emulating a human thought process with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking work frequently, reflecting, and adjusting approaches as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nOkay, so we have a rectangle with a length of \\(3x + 10\\) feet and a width of \\(x + 12\\) feet. The perimeter is given as 76 feet. We need to find the area of the rectangle in square feet.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Perimeter Formula:** I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides:  \n  \\[\n  P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n  \\]\n  So, I can set up an equation using this formula.\n\n- **Area Formula:** The area is simply the product of length and width:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving for \\(x\\):** It seems like I need to find \\(x\\) first by solving the perimeter equation. Once I have \\(x\\), I can find the length and width, and subsequently the area.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis approach makes sense because knowing \\(x\\) will give me the actual measurements of the rectangle, which are necessary to calculate the area. Let's proceed with setting up the perimeter equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Perimeter Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo find \\(x\\), I\u2019ll use the perimeter formula. Plugging in the expressions for length and width:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times ((3x + 10) + (x + 12)) = 76\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \nFirst, simplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n(3x + 10) + (x + 12) = 4x + 22\n\\]\n\nNow, plug this back into the perimeter equation:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (4x + 22) = 76\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**  \nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\n4x + 22 = 38\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks correct so far. Simplifying the perimeter equation should lead me to an equation in terms of \\(x\\). Let's proceed to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I\u2019ll isolate \\(x\\) in the equation:\n\n\\[\n4x + 22 = 38\n\\]\n\nSubtract 22 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n4x = 16\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nx = 4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Let me quickly plug \\(x = 4\\) back into the perimeter equation to verify.\n\n\\[\n4x + 22 = 4(4) + 22 = 16 + 22 = 38 \\quad \\text{(and doubled is 76, which matches)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe value of \\(x = 4\\) checks out with the perimeter equation. This suggests that the calculations are on the right track. Now, I\u2019ll use this \\(x\\) value to find the length and width.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating Length and Width**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWith \\(x = 4\\), I can now substitute back into the expressions for length and width:\n\n- **Length:**  \n  \\[\n  3x + 10 = 3(4) + 10 = 12 + 10 = 22 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Width:**  \n  \\[\n  x + 12 = 4 + 12 = 16 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nQuick sanity check:  \n- Length = 22 feet  \n- Width = 16 feet  \n- Does the perimeter equation hold? Let\u2019s check:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (22 + 16) = 2 \\times 38 = 76 \\quad \\text{(which matches the given perimeter)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe length and width calculations seem correct, as they satisfy the perimeter condition. With these dimensions, I can now calculate the area.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Area**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width. So:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 22 \\times 16\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \nMultiply:\n\n\\[\n22 \\times 16 = 352 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me briefly verify the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n22 \\times 16 = 22 \\times (10 + 6) = 22 \\times 10 + 22 \\times 6 = 220 + 132 = 352\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe area calculation yields 352 square feet, which seems reasonable given the dimensions. The intermediate checks along the way confirm that each step is accurate, leading to a consistent final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought Process: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Hmm, Let Me Think:**  \n- **Did I set up the perimeter equation correctly?** Yes, using \\(P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\\).\n- **Is solving for \\(x\\) accurate?** Checked and confirmed.\n- **Do the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition?** Yes, both length and width work out.\n- **Is the area calculation correct?** Verified through step-by-step multiplication.\n\n**Random Insight:**  \nEverything aligns well, and multiple checks along the way ensure that the approach is correct. If there had been an inconsistency, I would\u2019ve revisited the perimeter equation or the multiplication step.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically setting up the perimeter equation, solving for \\(x\\), and calculating the length and width, we determined that the area of the rectangle is **352 square feet**. Throughout the process, checking and reflecting at each step ensured the accuracy of the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions $l$ and $w$ is $2(l+w)$.  Setting $2(3x+10+x+12)$ equal to 76, we find $4x+22=38$, which implies $x=4$ feet.  The area of the rectangle is $(3x+10)(x+12)=(3(4)+10)(4+12)=\\boxed{352}$ square feet."
