    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll brainstorm various strategies, reflect often, and check my work as I go\u2014just like I would if I were doing this by hand.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**\"Find the sum of the coefficients in the polynomial \\(-2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) + 4(x^3 + 2x) - 3(x^5 - 4)\\).\"**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a polynomial with multiple terms, and we need to find the sum of its coefficients. The sum of coefficients usually involves evaluating the polynomial at a specific value\u2014commonly \\(x = 1\\)\u2014because plugging in \\(x = 1\\) simplifies the polynomial to just the sum of its coefficients.\n\n- **Alternative Thoughts:** Maybe I could expand everything and then add up all the coefficients. But that seems tedious. Alternatively, I could use the property that the sum of coefficients is the polynomial evaluated at \\(x = 1\\).\n\n- **Brainstorming:** \n  - **Option 1:** Evaluate the entire expression at \\(x = 1\\).\n  - **Option 2:** Expand each term individually and then sum the coefficients.\n  - **Option 3:** Factor out common coefficients before evaluating to simplify calculations.\n\nI think **Option 1** is the most straightforward: evaluate the polynomial at \\(x = 1\\). However, if it leads to complex calculations, I might reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluating Each Term at \\(x = 1\\)**\n\nLet\u2019s start by applying Option 1\u2014evaluate the entire expression at \\(x = 1\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n-2(1^7 - 1^4 + 3 \\times 1^2 - 5) + 4(1^3 + 2 \\times 1) - 3(1^5 - 4)\n\\]\n\n- **Breaking it Down:**\n  - **First Term:** \\( -2(1 - 1 + 3 - 5) \\)\n  - **Second Term:** \\( 4(1 + 2) \\)\n  - **Third Term:** \\( -3(1 - 4) \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait, let me simplify each part step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **First Term:**\n  \\[\n  1 - 1 + 3 - 5 = 0 + 3 - 5 = -2\n  \\]\n  So, \\( -2 \\times (-2) = 4 \\).\n\n- **Second Term:**\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 3 = 12\n  \\]\n  \n- **Third Term:**\n  \\[\n  -3 \\times (-3) = 9\n  \\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\nDoes each calculation make sense? Yes, each step follows logically, and the arithmetic checks out.\n\n**Sum of Coefficients:**\n\\[\n4 + 12 + 9 = 25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, the sum seems straightforward, but let me double-check by considering another approach to ensure it's correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Alternative Approach\u2014Expanding Each Term**\n\nLet\u2019s explore Option 2 to verify the result.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nExpand each term separately and then sum the coefficients.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThis approach might be more time-consuming, but it will confirm the correctness of the first method.\n\n- **First Term:** \n  \\[\n  -2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) = -2x^7 + 2x^4 - 6x^2 + 10\n  \\]\n- **Second Term:** \n  \\[\n  4(x^3 + 2x) = 4x^3 + 8x\n  \\]\n- **Third Term:** \n  \\[\n  -3(x^5 - 4) = -3x^5 + 12\n  \\]\n\n**Adding Them Together:**\n\\[\n-2x^7 + 4x^3 - 3x^5 + 2x^4 - 6x^2 + 8x + 10 + 12\n\\]\n\n**Summing the Coefficients:**\n\\[\n-2 + 4 - 3 + 2 - 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 = 25\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\nAgain, the sum of coefficients is **25**, which matches our first method.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. This consistency reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Quick Check\u2014Estimating the Result**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's do a quick check to see if the sum makes sense.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven the components:\n- Positive and negative terms balancing each other out.\n- The presence of \\(10\\) and \\(12\\) as large positives contributing significantly to the sum.\n\n**Estimation:**\n\\[\n10 + 12 = 22 \\\\\n\\text{Negatives: } -2 - 3 - 6 = -11 \\\\\n\\text{Positives: } 4 + 2 + 8 = 14 \\\\\n22 + 14 - 11 = 25\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\nThe estimation aligns perfectly with the calculated sum, adding another layer of confidence.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe sum being **25** feels reasonable, considering the balance of positive and negative coefficients.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies\u2014evaluating at \\(x = 1\\) and expanding each term separately\u2014and confirming the results through estimation, I\u2019m confident that the sum of the coefficients is **25**.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- Evaluating the polynomial at \\(x = 1\\) is the most efficient method for finding the sum of coefficients.\n- Expanding each term and summing the coefficients serves as a verification step.\n- Quick checks and estimations can help ensure accuracy and build confidence in the final answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{25}\n\\]",
