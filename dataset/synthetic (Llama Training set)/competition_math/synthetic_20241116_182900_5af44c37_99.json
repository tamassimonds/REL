I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking if I'm on the right track, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like a human would think while solving a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equations \\(2x - y = 5\\) and \\(x + 2y = 5\\), I think this might be a system of linear equations. Solving systems of equations is something I've dealt with before, but I want to explore my options to ensure I'm choosing the best strategy.\n\nPossible methods that come to mind:\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** Solve one equation for one variable and substitute it into the other.\n2. **Elimination Method:** Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable.\n3. **Graphical Method:** Plot both equations on a graph to find the intersection point.\n4. **Matrix Method:** Use matrices to find the solution.\n\nAt first glance, substitution or elimination seem the most straightforward for a beginner. Graphing might be more visual but could be less precise without tools, and matrices feel advanced for a simple problem like this.\n\nBut, honestly, I'm leaning toward **Substitution Method** because I remember taking that approach in similar problems. Let's give it a try and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Substitution Method**\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\n- I think I can solve one of the equations for either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) and then substitute that expression into the other equation.\n- Let's pick the first equation \\(2x - y = 5\\) and solve for \\(y\\).\n\n#### **Action:**\n\nRearranging \\(2x - y = 5\\) to solve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n2x - y = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -y = 5 - 2x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 2x - 5\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Solving for \\(y\\) gives me \\(y = 2x - 5\\). This looks correct because I just isolated \\(y\\) on one side. \n\nLet me **quickly check**: If I plug \\(y = 2x - 5\\) back into the original equation, it should satisfy \\(2x - y = 5\\).\n\n\\[\n2x - (2x - 5) = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2x - 2x + 5 = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5 = 5\n\\]\n\nPerfect! It checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting \\(y\\) into the Second Equation**\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have \\(y = 2x - 5\\), I can substitute this expression into the second equation \\(x + 2y = 5\\) to solve for \\(x\\).\n- This should give me the value of \\(x\\) if everything goes smoothly.\n\n#### **Action:**\n\nSubstituting \\(y = 2x - 5\\) into \\(x + 2y = 5\\):\n\n\\[\nx + 2(2x - 5) = 5\n\\]\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + 4x - 10 = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5x - 10 = 5\n\\]\n\nAdding 10 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n5x = 15\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so \\(x = 3\\). Let me **double-check** this result by plugging \\(x = 3\\) back into the original equations to see if it satisfies both.\n\nChecking in the first equation:\n\n\\[\n2(3) - y = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 6 - y = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, checking in the second equation:\n\n\\[\n3 + 2(1) = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3 + 2 = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5 = 5\n\\]\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so \\(x = 3\\) is indeed correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Elimination Method**\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\n- Just to ensure that our solution is correct, let's try the **Elimination Method** as a cross-check.\n- This method involves adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one variable.\n\n#### **Action:**\n\nLet's add the two equations together:\n\n\\[\n(2x - y) + (x + 2y) = 5 + 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3x + y = 10\n\\]\n\nNow we have a new equation: \\(3x + y = 10\\).\n\nBut wait, I already have an expression for \\(y\\) from the substitution method: \\(y = 2x - 5\\).\n\nLet's substitute \\(y = 2x - 5\\) into \\(3x + y = 10\\):\n\n\\[\n3x + (2x - 5) = 10 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5x - 5 = 10\n\\]\n\nAdding 5 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n5x = 15 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 3\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\nSo, using the Elimination Method, I also arrive at \\(x = 3\\). This confirms that our substitution approach was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Checks**\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\n- It's always good to double-check the solution by ensuring that both original equations are satisfied with \\(x = 3\\) and \\(y = 1\\).\n- Additionally, considering whether the methods used are appropriate for the problem type helps validate the approach.\n\n#### **Action:**\n\n**Checking in both original equations:**\n\n1. **First Equation:** \\(2x - y = 5\\)\n   \n   \\[\n   2(3) - 1 = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 6 - 1 = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5 = 5 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Equation:** \\(x + 2y = 5\\)\n   \n   \\[\n   3 + 2(1) = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3 + 2 = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5 = 5 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n   \\]\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so \\(x = 3\\) and \\(y = 1\\) are indeed the correct solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- Initially, I considered multiple methods but chose the **Substitution Method** to start, which worked effectively.\n- Throughout the process, I checked the correctness of each step by verifying the solutions in the original equations.\n- An alternative approach using the **Elimination Method** confirmed the result, providing additional reassurance.\n- Regular checks ensured that the methods were appropriate and that the calculations were correct, aligning with human-like problem-solving\u2014reflecting, checking, and adjusting as needed.\n\nBy approaching the problem this way, I've ensured a thorough and accurate solution, mirroring a natural human thought process in tackling math problems.",
