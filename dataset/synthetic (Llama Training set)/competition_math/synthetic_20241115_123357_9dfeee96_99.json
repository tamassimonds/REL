I need to find the value of \\(6 \\& 3\\).\n\nInitially, here's what comes to mind:\n\n- **Familiar with Operations**: This looks somewhat familiar to me because it involves basic arithmetic operations\u2014addition and subtraction\u2014combined in a specific way.\n  \n- **Multiplication of Sums and Differences**: The expression \\((a + b)(a - b)\\) reminds me of the difference of squares formula, which is \\(a^2 - b^2\\). But wait, the \\(\\&\\) operation isn't defined as that; it's just the product of the sum and difference. Still, that connection might be helpful.\n\n- **Explore Different Strategies**: I can approach this by directly plugging in the values into the definition, or perhaps simplify the expression using algebraic identities.\n\n- **Feeling Unsure**: At first glance, defining \\(\\&\\) in this way feels straightforward, but I wonder if there's a trick or shortcut I'm missing.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Operation\n\nBefore jumping into calculations, let me ensure I fully understand what the operation \\(\\&\\) means.\n\n- **Definition Recap**: The operation is defined as \\(a \\& b = (a + b)(a - b)\\). So, for any two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I need to find the product of their sum and their difference.\n\n- **Clarification Needed**: Just to be sure, the operation \\(\\&\\) combines both addition and subtraction of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and then multiplies the two results.\n\n**Thought Process**: I think I understand the operation now. It\u2019s about finding both the sum and the difference of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and then multiplying those two results together.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Definition to Given Values\n\nNow, let's apply this to find \\(6 \\& 3\\).\n\n- **Plugging in the Values**:\n  \\[\n  6 \\& 3 = (6 + 3)(6 - 3)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculating the Sum and Difference**:\n  \\[\n  6 + 3 = 9\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  6 - 3 = 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Multiplying the Results**:\n  \\[\n  9 \\times 3 = 27\n  \\]\n  \n**Check**: Multiplying 9 and 3 gives me 27. This seems straightforward, but let me double-check the steps to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\n### Step 3: Verifying the Calculation\n\nIt's always good to verify calculations, especially when the process feels too simple.\n\n- **Rechecking the Sum**:\n  \\[\n  6 + 3 = 9 \\quad \\text{(correct)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Rechecking the Difference**:\n  \\[\n  6 - 3 = 3 \\quad \\text{(correct)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Rechecking the Multiplication**:\n  \\[\n  9 \\times 3 = 27 \\quad \\text{(correct)}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection**: Everything checks out\u2014each step aligns with the operation's definition, and the arithmetic is correct.\n\n### Step 4: Considering Alternative Approaches\n\nThough the direct method worked, I like to explore if there's another way to arrive at the same answer.\n\n- **Alternative Idea**: Maybe I could simplify the expression \\((a + b)(a - b)\\) to see if there's a pattern or shortcut.\n\n- **Using the Difference of Squares Formula**:\n  \\[\n  (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Applying It Here**:\n  \\[\n  a = 6, \\, b = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 6^2 - 3^2 = 36 - 9 = 27\n  \\]\n  \n**Check**: This alternative approach also gives me 27. It's reassuring to see that different methods lead to the same result.\n\n### Step 5: Final Verification\n\nLet\u2019s do one last check to ensure the answer makes sense.\n\n- **Thinking It Through**: The operation involves multiplying the sum and difference of the given numbers. Since both sum and difference are positive in this case, the product should logically be positive as well.\n\n- **Comparing with Example**: If I had smaller numbers, like \\(2 \\& 1\\):\n  \\[\n  2 + 1 = 3,\\quad 2 - 1 = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3 \\times 1 = 3\n  \\]\n  This aligns with the definition, so it gives me confidence that the original calculation is correct.\n\n**Conclusion**: After exploring different strategies and verifying each step, the value of \\(6 \\& 3\\) is indeed **27**.\n\n### Final Reflection\n\n- **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I considered simplifying the expression using the difference of squares, which worked out, but starting with the definition provided a clear and direct path.\n\n- **Feelings During the Process**: At first, I felt unsure if there was a trick I was missing, but upon applying the definition step by step, everything fell into place.\n\n- **Lessons Learned**: It\u2019s valuable to verify each step and to be open to using different methods to confirm the result. Alternative approaches can provide additional reassurance that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**:  \\(\\boxed{27}\\)",
