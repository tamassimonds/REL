    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on whether each approach is correct, checking my work, and adjusting my methods as needed\u2014just like how I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem asks for the remainder when \\(7^{2010}\\) is divided by \\(100\\). At first glance, this reminds me of problems involving modular arithmetic, especially those dealing with large exponents. I recall that calculating such large powers directly isn't feasible, so we'll need a smarter approach\u2014maybe using properties of numbers or theorems like Euler\u2019s or the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nBut wait, let me brainstorm a bit more to see all possible strategies.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation:**\n   - **Thought:** Compute \\(7^{2010}\\) directly and then divide by \\(100\\) to find the remainder.\n   - **Reflection:** This approach is impractical because \\(7^{2010}\\) is an astronomically large number. Clearly, calculating it directly is not feasible.\n\n2. **Modular Exponentiation:**\n   - **Thought:** Use modular arithmetic techniques to simplify the exponentiation.\n   - **Reflection:** This sounds promising. I recall methods like reducing the exponent modulo \\(100\\) or using properties like Euler\u2019s theorem.\n\n3. **Euler's Theorem:**\n   - **Thought:** Since \\(7\\) and \\(100\\) are coprime, Euler\u2019s theorem might be applicable here.\n   - **Reflection:** This could be an elegant solution. Let me explore this further.\n\n4. **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**\n   - **Thought:** Break down the modulus \\(100\\) into its prime factors \\(4\\) and \\(25\\), and solve the congruences separately.\n   - **Reflection:** CRT is powerful for dealing with large exponents by breaking the problem into smaller, manageable parts. I think this might work well here.\n\n**Conclusion of Brainstorming:**\n\nAfter considering these options, using the **Chinese Remainder Theorem** seems like the most efficient method. It allows us to handle the large exponent by splitting the problem into two smaller congruences modulo \\(4\\) and \\(25\\), which are easier to compute.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s break down \\(7^{2010} \\mod 100\\) into two parts:\n- \\(7^{2010} \\mod 4\\)\n- \\(7^{2010} \\mod 25\\)\n\nOnce we find these remainders, we can combine them using CRT to find \\(7^{2010} \\mod 100\\).\n\n**Action:**\n\n**Part A: Compute \\(7^{2010} \\mod 4\\)**\n\n- **Simplification:** Notice that \\(7 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\).\n  \n  \\[\n  7^{2010} \\equiv 3^{2010} \\mod 4\n  \\]\n\n- **Observation:** Now, let's see the pattern of powers of \\(3\\) modulo \\(4\\):\n\n  \\[\n  3^1 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\n  \\]\n  \n  **Pattern:** Every even power of \\(3\\) is congruent to \\(1\\) modulo \\(4\\).\n\n- **Conclusion:** Since \\(2010\\) is even,\n\n  \\[\n  3^{2010} \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\n  \\]\n  \n  Therefore,\n\n  \\[\n  7^{2010} \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThat seems correct because raising \\(3\\) to any even power gives \\(1\\) modulo \\(4\\).\n\n**Part B: Compute \\(7^{2010} \\mod 25\\)**\n\n- **Thought:** Here, \\(25\\) is a prime power, so Euler's theorem could be helpful. But let's proceed by exploring patterns or using Euler\u2019s theorem directly.\n\n- **Calculating Euler\u2019s Totient Function:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\phi(25) = 25 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 25 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 20\n  \\]\n  \n  **Reflection:** Since \\(7\\) and \\(25\\) are coprime, Euler\u2019s theorem applies: \\(7^{20} \\equiv 1 \\mod 25\\).\n\n- **Reducing the Exponent:**\n  \n  \\[\n  2010 \\mod 20 = 10\n  \\]\n  \n  **Calculation:** Because \\(2010\\) divided by \\(20\\) leaves a remainder of \\(10\\), we can reduce the exponent:\n\n  \\[\n  7^{2010} \\equiv 7^{10} \\mod 25\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating \\(7^{10} \\mod 25\\):**\n  \n  Let's compute this step-by-step:\n\n  \\[\n  7^2 = 49 \\equiv 24 \\mod 25\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  7^4 = (7^2)^2 \\equiv 24^2 = 576 \\equiv 1 \\mod 25\n  \\]\n  \n  **Observation:** \\(7^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 25\\), so higher powers repeat every four exponents.\n\n  \\[\n  7^{10} = 7^{8} \\times 7^{2} = (7^4)^2 \\times 7^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\times 24 \\equiv 24 \\mod 25\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n\n  \\[\n  7^{2010} \\equiv 24 \\mod 25\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:**\n\nLet me verify:\n\n- \\(7^4 \\equiv 1\\) is correct since \\(576 \\div 25 = 23\\) remainder \\(1\\).\n- Multiplying it out: \\(7^{10} = 7^8 \\times 7^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\times 24 \\equiv 24\\).\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the System of Congruences Using CRT**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, we have a system of two congruences:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n7^{2010} \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\\\\n7^{2010} \\equiv 24 \\mod 25\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find a number \\(x\\) that satisfies both of these. CRT tells us that since \\(4\\) and \\(25\\) are coprime, there exists a unique solution modulo \\(100\\).\n\n**Action:**\n\n**Part A: Express \\(x\\) in Terms of the Modulus 25**\n\nLet\u2019s start by expressing \\(x\\) based on the second congruence:\n\n\\[\nx = 25k + 24 \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n\\]\n  \n**Part B: Substitute into the First Congruence**\n\nSubstitute \\(x\\) into the first congruence:\n\n\\[\n25k + 24 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\n\\]\n  \n**Simplifying:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Reduce \\(25 \\mod 4\\):\n  \n  \\[\n  25 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Step 2:** Substitute:\n  \n  \\[\n  1k + 24 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Step 3:** Reduce \\(24 \\mod 4\\):\n  \n  \\[\n  24 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Step 4:** Simplify the equation:\n  \n  \\[\n  k \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\n  \\]\n  \n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe solution for \\(k\\) is:\n\n\\[\nk = 4m + 1 \\quad \\text{for some integer } m\n\\]\n  \n**Part C: Substitute Back to Find \\(x\\)**\n\nNow substitute \\(k\\) back into the expression for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = 25(4m + 1) + 24 = 100m + 49\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, \\(x \\equiv 49 \\mod 100\\). This means that \\(x = 49\\) is the solution that satisfies both congruences.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s double-check if \\(x = 49\\) indeed satisfies both original congruences.\n\n**Action:**\n\n**Check \\(49 \\mod 4\\):**\n\n\\[\n49 \\div 4 = 12 \\text{ remainder } 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow\\quad 49 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\n\\]\n  \n**Check \\(49 \\mod 25\\):**\n\n\\[\n49 \\div 25 = 1 \\text{ remainder } 24 \\quad \\Rightarrow\\quad 49 \\equiv 24 \\mod 25\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth checks satisfy the original congruences. Therefore, \\(x = 49\\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, I found that applying the **Chinese Remainder Theorem** was the most efficient approach. Here\u2019s a summary of the steps:\n\n1. **Break Down the Problem:** Use CRT to handle \\(7^{2010} \\mod 100\\) by solving \\(7^{2010} \\mod 4\\) and \\(7^{2010} \\mod 25\\).\n\n2. **Compute \\(7^{2010} \\mod 4\\):** Simplified to \\(1 \\mod 4\\).\n\n3. **Compute \\(7^{2010} \\mod 25\\):** Using Euler\u2019s theorem, reduced the exponent to \\(10\\) and found \\(24 \\mod 25\\).\n\n4. **Apply CRT:** Solved the system of congruences to find \\(x = 49 \\mod 100\\).\n\n5. **Final Check:** Verified that \\(49\\) satisfies both congruences.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe remainder when \\(7^{2010}\\) is divided by \\(100\\) is **49**.\n\nThroughout the process, I brainstormed different methods, reflected on each step to ensure correctness, and adjusted my approach as needed\u2014just like a human solving a problem on paper.",

  "ground_truth": "We begin by computing the remainder of some small powers of $7$. As $7^0 = 1, 7^1 = 7,$ and $7^2 = 49$, then $7^3 = 49 \\cdot 7 = 343$ leaves a remainder of $43$ after division by $100$, and $7^4$ leaves the remainder that $43 \\cdot 7 = 301$ does after division by $100$, namely $1$. The sequence of powers thus repeat modulo $100$ again. In particular, the remainder that the powers of $7$ leave after division by $100$ is periodic with period $4$. Then, $7^{2010} = 7^{4 \\cdot 502 + 2}$ leaves the same remainder as $7^2$ does after division by $100$, which is $\\boxed{49}$."
