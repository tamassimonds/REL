    "working_out": "### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem involving triangle \\( PQR \\) and point \\( T \\) on side \\( QR \\). Here's what I see at first glance:\n\n- **Given Measurements:** \n  - \\( QT = 6 \\)\n  - \\( TR = 10 \\)\n  \n- **Objective:** Find the ratio of the areas of triangles \\( PQT \\) and \\( PTR \\).\n  \nFirst thoughts:\n\n- **Area Comparison:** Since both triangles share side \\( PT \\), their areas will depend on the lengths of bases \\( QT \\) and \\( TR \\) and their corresponding heights from point \\( P \\) to line \\( QR \\).\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Use of Height Ratios:** If I can find the ratio of the heights from \\( P \\) to \\( QR \\) for each triangle, that might help.\n  2. **Coordinate Geometry:** Assigning coordinates to each point could simplify calculating the areas.\n  3. **Proportionality of Areas:** Since \\( QR \\) is divided into \\( QT \\) and \\( TR \\), maybe the area ratio directly relates to these lengths.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should explore these options a bit to see which one might be more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Exploring Strategy 1: Proportionality of Areas Based on Base Lengths\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The areas of triangles sharing a common vertex and lying on the same base are proportional to the lengths of their respective bases.\n  \n- For \\( \\triangle PQT \\) and \\( \\triangle PTR \\), since \\( PT \\) is common and horizontal, the ratio of their areas should equal the ratio of their bases \\( QT \\) to \\( TR \\).\n\n- **Formula:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area}_{\\triangle PQT} : \\text{Area}_{\\triangle PTR} = QT : TR\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  QT = 6, \\quad TR = 10\n  \\]\n  \n  So,\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area}_{\\triangle PQT} : \\text{Area}_{\\triangle PTR} = 6 : 10\n  \\]\n  \n  This simplifies to:\n  \\[\n  3 : 5\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute. Does this make sense? Let me think. If both triangles share side \\( PT \\) and are on the same base \\( QR \\), then the ratio of their areas should indeed relate to the lengths \\( QT \\) and \\( TR \\). This feels right.\n\n---\n\n### Double-Checking with Strategy 2: Coordinate Geometry Approach\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Maybe assigning coordinates could provide a clearer verification.\n  \n- By placing point \\( P \\) at a certain height and calculating the areas using the determinant method or the half-base times height formula, I can cross-check the first method.\n\n- **Assign Coordinates:**\n  - Let\u2019s say \\( Q = (0, 0) \\), \\( T = (6, 0) \\), \\( R = (16, 0) \\), and \\( P = (x, h) \\).\n  \n- **Calculating Heights:**\n  - The heights from \\( P \\) to \\( QR \\) are equal for both triangles since they share vertex \\( P \\).\n  \n- **Area Calculation:**\n  - Area of \\( \\triangle PQT \\):\n    \\[\n    \\frac{1}{2} \\times QT \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times h = 3h\n    \\]\n    \n  - Area of \\( \\triangle PTR \\):\n    \\[\n    \\frac{1}{2} \\times TR \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times h = 5h\n    \\]\n    \n- **Ratio:**\n  \\[\n  3h : 5h = 3 : 5\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis method also confirms the ratio as \\( 3 : 5 \\). It aligns with the first approach, which gives me confidence that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Check and Conclusion\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- Both strategies lead to the same ratio: \\( 3 : 5 \\).\n  \n- The proportionality of areas based on base lengths is a valid approach since the triangles share a common height from \\( P \\) to \\( QR \\).\n\n- The coordinate geometry method serves as a verification, ensuring that the initial approach was correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe ratio of the area of \\( \\triangle PQT \\) to the area of \\( \\triangle PTR \\) is **\\( 3 : 5 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the Thought Process\n\n1. **Brainstorming:** Started by exploring different methods to find the area ratio.\n   \n2. **Choosing Strategy:** Opted for proportionality of areas based on base lengths, as it seemed straightforward.\n   \n3. **Calculation:** Determined the ratio as \\( 6 : 10 \\), simplified to \\( 3 : 5 \\).\n   \n4. **Verification:** Used coordinate geometry to confirm the ratio, ensuring the correctness.\n   \n5. **Reflection:** Regularly checked if the approaches made sense and aligned with geometric principles.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** Finalized the ratio as \\( 3 : 5 \\), supported by multiple methods.\n\nBy keeping the thought process transparent and checking each step, I've ensured a reliable solution to the problem.",
