    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's start by **understanding the question**:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Question**\nThe problem is:  \n\\[ \n4 \\cdot 6 + 8 \\cdot 3 - 28 \\div 2 \n\\]\n  \nAt first glance, this looks like a straightforward arithmetic expression involving multiplication, addition, and subtraction. I remember from math classes that there's a specific order in which these operations need to be performed\u2014**the order of operations**, often abbreviated as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \n\"Okay, I see multiplication, addition, and subtraction here. I need to remember PEMDAS to get the correct answer. But let me brainstorm how to approach this\u2014should I tackle it one operation at a time following the order, or is there another strategy that might make it easier?\"\n\n### **2. Brainstorming Strategies**\n- **Strategy 1:** Follow PEMDAS strictly, performing each operation in the order dictated.\n\n- **Strategy 2:** Group similar operations together to simplify calculations.\n\n- **Strategy 3:** Evaluate each term separately before combining them to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\"Maybe starting with PEMDAS is the most straightforward approach. But I should also be open to grouping terms if that makes calculations easier. Let's see how it goes.\"\n\n### **3. Starting with Strategy 1: Follow PEMDAS**\n\n**Step 1: Perform Multiplications and Division First**\n\nAccording to PEMDAS, I should start with multiplication and division, moving from left to right:\n\n- **First operation:** \\(4 \\cdot 6\\)  \n  \\[\n  4 \\times 6 = 24\n  \\]\n  \n- **Next operation:** \\(8 \\cdot 3\\)  \n  \\[\n  8 \\times 3 = 24\n  \\]\n  \n- **Then:** \\(28 \\div 2\\)  \n  \\[\n  28 \\div 2 = 14\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\"Alright, I've completed the multiplications and the division. Each step seems straightforward, and the numbers look reasonable. Now, let me move on to the addition and subtraction.\"\n\n**Check:**  \n\"Quick check: \\(24\\), \\(24\\), and \\(14\\) from multiplications and division\u2014all positive and manageable. No red flags so far.\"\n\n### **4. Step 2: Perform Addition and Subtraction**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll handle the addition and subtraction in order from left to right:\n\n- **Add:** \\(24 + 24\\)  \n  \\[\n  24 + 24 = 48\n  \\]\n  \n- **Subtract:** \\(48 - 14\\)  \n  \\[\n  48 - 14 = 34\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\"The addition gives me \\(48\\), and subtracting \\(14\\) brings me to \\(34\\). This feels complete, but let me double-check to ensure I followed the order correctly.\"\n\n**Check:**  \n\"Adding \\(24\\) and \\(24\\) makes sense, and subtracting \\(14\\) from \\(48\\) also checks out. So, the final answer is \\(34\\).\"\n\n### **5. Alternative Approach: Strategy 2\u2014Grouping Similar Operations**\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\"Wait, let me consider if grouping operations could simplify things. Maybe adding the multiplications together before handling the subtraction would streamline the process.\"\n\n**Step 1: Group Multiplications and Addition**\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n\\[ \n(4 \\cdot 6) + (8 \\cdot 3) - (28 \\div 2) \n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \n24 + 24 - 14 \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\"Grouping the multiplications first keeps things organized. Now, adding and then subtracting seems straightforward.\"\n\n**Step 2: Perform the Grouped Operations**\n\n- **Add:** \\(24 + 24 = 48\\)  \n- **Subtract:** \\(48 - 14 = 34\\)  \n\n**Check:**  \n\"Grouping didn't change the outcome, but it might make the process clearer. The final answer remains \\(34\\).\"\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\"Both strategies lead to the same answer. Grouping helped in visualizing the problem better, but following PEMDAS strictly worked just fine too.\"\n\n### **6. Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Check:**  \n- Multiplications: \\(4 \\cdot 6 = 24\\), \\(8 \\cdot 3 = 24\\)\n- Division: \\(28 \\div 2 = 14\\)\n- Addition: \\(24 + 24 = 48\\)\n- Subtraction: \\(48 - 14 = 34\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\"Everything checks out step by step. The operations were performed in the correct order, and the numbers make sense throughout. No inconsistencies or errors.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe final answer is **34**.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\"I'm satisfied with the approach. Both methods\u2014strictly following PEMDAS and grouping operations\u2014led me to the same correct answer. Checking each step ensured accuracy, and being open to adjusting the strategy helped streamline the process.\"\n\n---\n\nIn summary, by brainstorming different strategies, following the order of operations meticulously, and reflecting throughout the process, I arrived at the correct answer of **34**. Checking and verifying each step ensured the solution's accuracy, making the approach robust and reliable.",

  "ground_truth": "Recall that multiplication and division should be done in order from left to right before addition and subtraction.  We have \\begin{align*}4\\cdot 6+8\\cdot 3-28\\div 2&=24+24-14.\\end{align*}  Now, we rewrite the subtraction as the addition of a negation so that we can use the properties of addition to rearrange the numbers and make the arithmetic easier.  We get \\begin{align*}24+24-14&=24+24+(-14) \\\\ &=24+(-14)+24 \\\\ &=24-14+24 \\\\ &=10+24 \\\\ &=\\boxed{34}.\\end{align*}"
