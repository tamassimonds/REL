I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the question:  \n**Find the positive base \\( b \\) in which the equation \\( 5_b \\cdot 23_b = 151_b \\) is valid.**\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of working with different numeral systems, like when we convert numbers from one base to another. I think I need to understand what each number represents in base \\( b \\) and then see if the multiplication holds true.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not sure how to start. Maybe I should convert these numbers to base 10 and see if the equation still holds. Alternatively, I could try to set up an equation based on base \\( b \\) properties. I'm leaning towards converting to base 10 since that might simplify things, but let's explore a bit more.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Convert to Base 10:** Translate \\( 5_b \\), \\( 23_b \\), and \\( 151_b \\) to base 10 and check if the equation holds.\n2. **Set Up an Algebraic Equation:** Use the definition of multiplication in different bases to create an equation.\n3. **Trial and Error with Small Bases:** Start with small bases and see if the equation holds, then check if a pattern emerges.\n\nI think starting with converting to base 10 might be the most straightforward. If that doesn't work, I'll consider the other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Converting to Base 10**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s convert each number from base \\( b \\) to base 10. This should give me a clearer picture of what the equation means.\n\n1. **Convert \\( 5_b \\) to Base 10:**\n   - In base \\( b \\), \\( 5_b \\) means \\( 5 \\times b^0 = 5 \\).\n   - So, \\( 5_b = 5_{10} \\).\n\n   *Reflection:* Wait, that seems too simple. But since \\( 5_b \\) only contains a single digit and the base is at least 6 (since base must be greater than the highest digit), this should be correct.\n\n2. **Convert \\( 23_b \\) to Base 10:**\n   - \\( 23_b = 2 \\times b^1 + 3 \\times b^0 = 2b + 3 \\).\n\n3. **Convert \\( 151_b \\) to Base 10:**\n   - \\( 151_b = 1 \\times b^2 + 5 \\times b^1 + 1 \\times b^0 = b^2 + 5b + 1 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \nSo, in base 10, the equation is:\n\\[ 5 \\times (2b + 3) = b^2 + 5b + 1 \\]\n\nLet me double-check that conversion:\n- \\( 5_b = 5 \\times 1 = 5_{10} \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\( 23_b = 2 \\times b + 3 \\times 1 = 2b + 3 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\( 151_b = 1 \\times b^2 + 5 \\times b + 1 \\times 1 = b^2 + 5b + 1 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Everything seems correct so far.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have both sides of the equation in base 10, I can set them equal to each other and solve for \\( b \\).\n\nThe equation is:\n\\[ 5 \\times (2b + 3) = b^2 + 5b + 1 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s expand the left side:\n\n\\[ 10b + 15 = b^2 + 5b + 1 \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDid I distribute correctly?  \n\\[ 5 \\times 2b = 10b \\]  \n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\]  \n*Yup, that looks right.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo solve for \\( b \\), I need to get all terms on one side of the equation. Let's move everything to the right side:\n\n\\[ 0 = b^2 + 5b + 1 - 10b - 15 \\]  \n\\[ 0 = b^2 - 5b - 14 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks like a quadratic equation, which I can solve using factoring, the quadratic formula, or other methods. Let's see if it factors nicely first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Attempting to Factor the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAttempting to factor \\( b^2 - 5b - 14 = 0 \\). I'm hoping it factors into two binomials.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-14\\) (the constant term) and add to \\(-5\\) (the coefficient of \\( b \\)).\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- Possible pairs that multiply to \\(-14\\):  \n  - \\((-7, 2)\\)  \n  - \\((7, -2)\\)  \n  - \\((-14, 1)\\)  \n  - \\((14, -1)\\)\n\nWait, let me check which pair adds up to \\(-5\\):\n\n- \\((-7) + 2 = -5\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\((7) + (-2) = 5\\) \u274c\n- \\((-14) + 1 = -13\\) \u274c\n- \\((14) + (-1) = 13\\) \u274c\n\n*Only the pair \\((-7, 2)\\) works.*\n\n**Factoring the Equation:**\n\\[ (b - 7)(b + 2) = 0 \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me quickly verify:\n- \\((-7) \\times 2 = -14\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\((-7) + 2 = -5\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n*Looks correct.*\n\n**Solutions for \\( b \\):**\n\\[ b - 7 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 7 \\]  \n\\[ b + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = -2 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince the base must be a positive integer greater than the largest digit in the numbers (which is 5), the only valid solution is \\( b = 7 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, let's verify that \\( b = 7 \\) satisfies the original equation.\n\n1. **Convert Numbers to Base 10 with \\( b = 7 \\):**\n   - \\( 5_7 = 5_{10} \\)\n   - \\( 23_7 = 2 \\times 7 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17_{10} \\)\n   - \\( 151_7 = 1 \\times 7^2 + 5 \\times 7 + 1 = 49 + 35 + 1 = 85_{10} \\)\n\n2. **Check the Multiplication:**\n   \\[ 5 \\times 17 = 85 \\]  \n   \\[ 85 = 85 \\] \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Observation:**  \nThe equation holds true in base 10 when \\( b = 7 \\). This confirms that our solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy converting the numbers to base 10, we were able to set up a quadratic equation that factored neatly. Checking the solution ensured that \\( b = 7 \\) is valid. Initially, I considered multiple strategies, but converting to base 10 proved to be the most straightforward approach.\n\n**Brainstorming Alternative Strategies:**  \nIf factoring hadn't worked, I could have used the quadratic formula to solve \\( b^2 - 5b - 14 = 0 \\). That would have led to the same solution, but factoring made it quicker and easier.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe positive base \\( b \\) in which the equation \\( 5_b \\cdot 23_b = 151_b \\) is valid is **\\( b = 7 \\)**.",
