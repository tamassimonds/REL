    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem as if I'm thinking through it naturally, exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and reflecting on whether each approach makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, I see the problem: Find the value of \\( y \\) in the arithmetic sequence \\( y + 6 \\), \\( 12 \\), \\( y \\).\n\nHmm... an arithmetic sequence, huh? That automatically makes me think about the definition: In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is always the same. So, let me brainstorm how I can use that property here.\n\n- **Initial Idea:** Maybe I can set up an equation based on the common difference between the terms.\n- **Alternative Thoughts:** Perhaps there's another property I can leverage, like the position of the terms or relationships among them.\n\nHold on, let me jot down what I know:\n\n- The sequence is: \\( y + 6 \\), \\( 12 \\), \\( y \\).\n- Arithmetic sequence means the difference between terms is constant.\n- I need to find \\( y \\).\n\nAt this moment, I'm leaning toward using the common difference to set up an equation, but let me explore a bit more to see if there are other viable strategies.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Using the Common Difference:**\n   - Probably the most straightforward approach. I can set the difference between the second and first terms equal to the difference between the third and second terms.\n\n2. **Positioning in the Sequence:**\n   - Consider the positions of each term. Maybe there's something about the middle term being the average of the others?\n\n3. **Rearranging the Sequence:**\n   - Maybe rearranging the terms to see if a pattern emerges could help.\n\nOkay, the first strategy seems the most direct. I'll start with that and see where it leads. If it gets messy or doesn't make sense, I'll pivot to another approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Common Difference**\n\nLet me write down what I know about the common difference:\n\n- In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\n- So, \\( 12 - (y + 6) = y - 12 \\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that...\n\n- **Thought Process:** The common difference should be the same in both cases: from the first to the second term and from the second to the third term.\n- **Equation:** So, \\( 12 - (y + 6) = y - 12 \\).\n\nAlright, let's simplify this equation.\n\n#### **Simplifying the Equation**\n\n1. **Expand the Left Side:**\n   \\[\n   12 - (y + 6) = 12 - y - 6 = 6 - y\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   6 - y = y - 12\n   \\]\n\nHmm... this looks reasonable so far. Let's solve for \\( y \\).\n\n#### **Solving for \\( y \\)**\n\n1. **Add \\( y \\) to Both Sides:**\n   \\[\n   6 = 2y - 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add 12 to Both Sides:**\n   \\[\n   6 + 12 = 2y \\implies 18 = 2y\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{18}{2} = 9\n   \\]\n\nOkay, so \\( y = 9 \\). But before I finalize this, let me check if it makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n- **Original Sequence with \\( y = 9 \\):**\n  - \\( 9 + 6 = 15 \\)\n  - So, the sequence is: \\( 15 \\), \\( 12 \\), \\( 9 \\)\n\n- **Checking the Common Difference:**\n  - Difference between 15 and 12: \\( 12 - 15 = -3 \\)\n  - Difference between 12 and 9: \\( 9 - 12 = -3 \\)\n\nHmm... both differences are indeed \\(-3\\), which is consistent. So, the arithmetic sequence property holds. It seems like the approach worked.\n\nBut let me reflect for a moment:\n\n- **Was there any assumption that might be wrong?** No, the definition of an arithmetic sequence was applied correctly.\n- **Could there be another solution?** The common difference method is robust here, but let me think if another strategy would yield a different result.\n\nI can't think of another method that would apply differently here, so I'm confident in the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Positioning in the Sequence**\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider another approach:\n\n- **Idea:** In an arithmetic sequence, the middle term is the average of the first and third terms.\n\nSo, let's set up the equation based on that:\n\n\\[\n12 = \\frac{(y + 6) + y}{2}\n\\]\n\nWait, let's solve this to see if it gives the same \\( y \\).\n\n#### **Solving for \\( y \\) Using Averages**\n\n1. **Multiply Both Sides by 2:**\n   \\[\n   24 = (y + 6) + y \\implies 24 = 2y + 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract 6 from Both Sides:**\n   \\[\n   24 - 6 = 2y \\implies 18 = 2y\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide by 2:**\n   \\[\n   y = 9\n   \\]\n\nInteresting! This method also gives \\( y = 9 \\). So, both strategies align, reinforcing the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Both Strategies Yielded the Same Result:** Whether using the common difference directly or leveraging the property of the middle term being the average, we arrived at \\( y = 9 \\).\n- **Consistency Check:** The common differences are consistent throughout the sequence, validating the arithmetic property.\n- **Confidence in the Solution:** Given that both methods lead to the same \\( y \\) value and align with the definition of an arithmetic sequence, I'm confident that \\( y = 9 \\) is correct.\n\nI think I've explored the problem thoroughly and checked my work along the way. The value of \\( y \\) in the arithmetic sequence is indeed **9**.",
