    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process as if I'm tackling it step by step, reflecting, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and making adjustments along the way. Let's start by understanding the question thoroughly.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**User Query:**\nFind the matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) such that for any vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), \\(\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{v}\\) is the projection of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto the \\(yz\\)-plane.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Immediately, this reminds me of vector projections I've dealt with before.\n- The \\(yz\\)-plane suggests we're dealing with a three-dimensional space, so vectors have components in \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n- To project onto the \\(yz\\)-plane, perhaps we're \"removing\" or zeroing out the \\(x\\)-component of a vector.\n- I think of orthogonal projections where only certain components remain.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Use the Standard Projection Formula:** Recall how projections are generally calculated using dot products and direction vectors.\n2. **Matrix Representation of Projections:** Remember that projections can be represented by matrices, especially in linear algebra contexts.\n3. **Exploring Identity and Zero Matrices:** Consider if manipulating identity or zero matrices could create the desired projection effect.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Option 1 seems straightforward but might not directly lead to a matrix representation.\n- Option 2 aligns well with the goal of finding a matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\).\n- Option 3 might be worth exploring, especially since we're familiar with identity and zero matrices being involved in such operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Visualizing the Projection**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- When I think about projecting onto the \\(yz\\)-plane, I visualize a vector in three-dimensional space whose \\(x\\)-component is flattened to zero, retaining only its \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) components.\n- This aligns with the idea that vectors in the \\(yz\\)-plane have an \\(x\\)-component of zero.\n\n**Action:**\n- Let's represent a general vector \\(\\mathbf{v} = [v_x, v_y, v_z]^T\\).\n- After projecting onto the \\(yz\\)-plane, the resulting vector should be \\([0, v_y, v_z]^T\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- This makes sense because only the \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) components remain, aligning with the definition of the \\(yz\\)-plane.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The thought process confirms that nullifying the \\(x\\)-component is the right direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the Matrix Representation**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- To achieve this projection using a matrix, we need to find a matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) that, when multiplied by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), zeros out the \\(x\\)-component.\n- This reminds me of how projection matrices work, especially in orthogonal projections.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Perhaps \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) should have specific entries that zero out the \\(x\\)-component while leaving \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) unchanged.\n- Thinking of identity matrices, maybe I can tweak the identity matrix to achieve this.\n\n**Action:**\n- Considering that the identity matrix \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) for three dimensions is:\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{I} = \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n- If I want to zero out the \\(x\\)-component, maybe I can replace the \\(1\\) in the \\(x\\)-row with \\(0\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems like a promising approach. By altering the identity matrix, I can create a projection matrix specific to the \\(yz\\)-plane.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Constructing the Projection Matrix**\n\n**Action:**\n- Modify the identity matrix by setting the first row to zero:\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{P} = \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n- Here, the first row being all zeros ensures that the \\(x\\)-component of any vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is zeroed out upon multiplication.\n\n**Check:**\n- Let's verify:\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{v} = \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  v_x \\\\\n  v_y \\\\\n  v_z\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  = \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 \\times v_x + 0 \\times v_y + 0 \\times v_z \\\\\n  0 \\times v_x + 1 \\times v_y + 0 \\times v_z \\\\\n  0 \\times v_x + 0 \\times v_y + 1 \\times v_z\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  = \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 \\\\\n  v_y \\\\\n  v_z\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n- The \\(x\\)-component is indeed zeroed out, leaving \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) components unchanged.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- It looks like the matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) is doing exactly what's needed for the projection onto the \\(yz\\)-plane. \n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Wait, let me double-check if setting the \\(x\\)-row to zero is sufficient.\n- I recall that in projection matrices, the sum of the squares of the entries in each row must equal one for orthogonal projections.\n- However, since we're only zeroing out the \\(x\\)-component and preserving \\(y\\) and \\(z\\), maybe this isn't strictly necessary here.\n\n**Check:**\n- Looking back at the construction:\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{P} = \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n- Each row is independent, and zeroing the \\(x\\)-row doesn't affect the \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) rows.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The matrix seems valid. The \\(x\\)-row ensures no contribution from the \\(x\\)-component, while the \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) rows allow \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) components to pass through unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using Standard Projection Formula**\n\n**New Thoughts:**\n- Another way to approach this is by using the standard formula for the projection matrix.\n- I remember that the projection matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) can be defined using outer products and normalization.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- The projection matrix onto a subspace can be expressed as:\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{P} = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u}^T}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2}\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is a direction vector of the subspace.\n- For the \\(yz\\)-plane, the direction vector could be \\([0, 1, 0]^T\\) and \\([0, 0, 1]^T\\), but combining them seems tricky.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This might get messy because I need to combine projections onto both \\(y\\)- and \\(z\\)-axes.\n- Alternatively, I can recall that projecting onto multiple axes can be represented by a diagonal matrix with ones for the axes being preserved and zeros for those being projected out.\n\n**Action:**\n- Instead of calculating it from scratch, let's see if our previous matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) aligns with this idea.\n\n**Check:**\n- The diagonal entries corresponding to \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) are ones, and the \\(x\\)-entry is zero.\n- This matches the concept of a projection matrix preserving specific components.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Even though I didn't compute it directly using this formula, the matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) aligns with the principles behind it.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n**Summary:**\n- We started by visualizing the projection onto the \\(yz\\)-plane, leading to the idea of zeroing out the \\(x\\)-component of any vector.\n- Through brainstorming, we explored different strategies, settling on constructing a diagonal matrix that nullifies the \\(x\\)-row.\n- We verified that the matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) correctly performs the desired projection.\n- An alternative approach using the standard projection formula reinforced the validity of our matrix representation.\n\n**Final Matrix:**\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Throughout the process, checking after each step ensured that our approach was correct.\n- Exploring different strategies helped confirm the validity of our solution.\n- Being open to alternative methods and reflecting on each step ensured a robust and accurate answer.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough mimics a natural human thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflections, and checks, making it clear and comprehensive.
