    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, thinking through each part like a human would\u2014brainstorming strategies, reflecting on approaches, checking work, and adjusting as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the function\n\n\\[\nj(x) = \\frac{1}{x+8} + \\frac{1}{x^2+8} + \\frac{1}{x^3+8},\n\\]\n\nmy initial reaction is that this involves fractions with polynomials in the denominators. Functions like these often have **domains** that are restricted by the values of \\(x\\) that make the denominators zero. It reminds me of finding the domain for rational functions.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n1. **Identify Restrictions:** My first thought is to find the values of \\(x\\) that make any denominator zero because those will be excluded from the domain.\n2. **Factor the Denominators:** Maybe factoring could help, but looking at them, \\(x+8\\), \\(x^2+8\\), and \\(x^3+8\\), I'm not sure if factoring will work easily\u2014especially since \\(x^2 + 8\\) and \\(x^3 + 8\\) don't factor over the reals.\n3. **Use Real Numbers Only:** Since we're asked for the domain in real numbers, I need to ensure any restrictions are within that set.\n\n**Reflection:** \n- I think focusing on where each denominator equals zero makes sense. If a denominator is zero, the function is undefined at that \\(x\\) value.\n- However, \\(x^2 + 8\\) and \\(x^3 + 8\\) don't seem to have real roots (at least \\(x^2 + 8\\) doesn't), which might simplify things.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding Restrictions for Each Term**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's tackle each term one by one to see where their denominators are zero.\n\n1. **For \\( \\frac{1}{x + 8} \\):**\n   - Set the denominator to zero: \\( x + 8 = 0 \\)\n   - Solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = -8 \\)\n\n2. **For \\( \\frac{1}{x^2 + 8} \\):**\n   - Set the denominator to zero: \\( x^2 + 8 = 0 \\)\n   - Solving this: \\( x^2 = -8 \\)\n   - Since we're dealing with real numbers, there are no real solutions because you can't square a real number and get a negative result.\n\n3. **For \\( \\frac{1}{x^3 + 8} \\):**\n   - Set the denominator to zero: \\( x^3 + 8 = 0 \\)\n   - Solve for \\( x \\): \\( x^3 = -8 \\)\n   - Taking the cube root: \\( x = -2 \\)\n\n**Check:**\n- So, the denominators are zero at \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\).\n- **Reflection:** Wait, only \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) seem to be problematic. Initially, I thought all three terms might have restrictions, but \\( x^2 + 8 = 0 \\) has no real solutions.\n\n**Thought:** \n- This simplifies things. The only real value that causes an issue is \\( x = -8 \\). The other term, \\( x^3 + 8 = 0 \\), affects \\( x = -2 \\), but since \\( x^2 + 8 \\) has no real roots, it doesn't add any more restrictions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering the Domain**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to determine the domain of \\( j(x) \\) by excluding the values where the function is undefined due to the denominators being zero.\n\n**Approach:**\n- **Union of Intervals:** The domain will be all real numbers except where the denominators are zero.\n- **Intervals to Exclude:** Since there's no restriction from \\( x^2 + 8 \\) (as it has no real roots), only \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) need to be excluded.\n\n**Checking:**\n- Therefore, the domain should be all real numbers except \\( -8 \\) and \\( -2 \\).\n- I need to express this as a union of intervals.\n\n**Reflection:** \n- This makes sense. Excluding specific points from the real line results in a series of intervals where the function is defined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Writing the Domain as a Union of Intervals**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo express the domain, I need to list all the intervals on the real number line except for \\( -8 \\) and \\( -2 \\).\n\n**Approach:**\n- Use parentheses to denote that these points are excluded.\n- Write the domain as a union of all intervals that do not include \\( -8 \\) and \\( -2 \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- How do I cover all real numbers while excluding just two points?\n- I can start from negative infinity up to \\( -8 \\), then from \\( -8 \\) to \\( -2 \\), and finally from \\( -2 \\) to positive infinity.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- That seems correct. By breaking the real line into sections around the excluded points, I can accurately represent the domain.\n\n**Check:**\n- Let\u2019s list the intervals:\n  - \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\)\n  - \\( (-8, -2) \\)\n  - \\( (-2, \\infty) \\)\n- This covers all real numbers except \\( -8 \\) and \\( -2 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\text{Domain of } j(x): (-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, -2) \\cup (-2, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Does this make sense? Yes, excluding \\( -8 \\) and \\( -2 \\) ensures the function is defined everywhere else on the real line.\n- I considered all terms individually and found their restrictions.\n- The approach of expressing the domain as a union of intervals is standard for this type of problem.\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n- Revisited each term's denominator: Confirmed that only \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) cause issues.\n- Ensured that all real numbers except these points are included in the domain.\n\n**Thought:** \n- Everything checks out. The domain is correctly expressed as a union of intervals excluding the problematic points.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically identifying the restrictions imposed by each term's denominator and carefully constructing the domain as a union of intervals, I've determined that the function \\( j(x) \\) is defined for all real numbers except \\( -8 \\) and \\( -2 \\). Throughout the process, reflecting on each step and verifying the approach ensured accuracy and clarity in arriving at the final domain.\n\n---\n\nThis walkthrough captures the human-like thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies to solve the problem confidently and accurately.",

  "ground_truth": "We note that $j(x)$ is defined unless one or more of the denominators $x+8,~x^2+8,~x^3+8$ is equal to $0$.\n\nWe have $x+8=0$ if $x=-8$, and $x^3+8$ if $x=\\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2$. There is no real $x$ for which $x^2+8=0$. Therefore, the domain of $j(x)$ consists of all real $x$ except $-8$ and $-2$. As a union of intervals, this is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-8)\\cup (-8,-2)\\cup (-2,\\infty)}$."
