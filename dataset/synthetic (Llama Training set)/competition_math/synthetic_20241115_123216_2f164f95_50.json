    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. First, I want to **fully understand** what's being asked.\n\n### **User Question:**\nThe digits \\(1, 2, 3, 4,\\) and \\(5\\) can be arranged to form different \\(5\\)-digit positive integers with five distinct digits. **In how many such integers is the digit \\(1\\) to the left of the digit \\(2\\)?**  \n*(The digits \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) do not have to be next to each other.)*\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Total Arrangements Approach:** \n   - Calculate the total number of \\(5\\)-digit integers using all digits.\n   - Then, find a way to determine how many of these have \\(1\\) to the left of \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Symmetry Argument:**\n   - Since every arrangement is equally likely, maybe there's a symmetrical property that can help.\n   - Perhaps the positions of \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) are equally likely to be in either order.\n\n3. **Case-by-Case Analysis:**\n   - List out specific cases where \\(1\\) is to the left of \\(2\\) and count them.\n\n4. **Combinatorial Methods:**\n   - Use combinations or permutations to count specific favorable arrangements.\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards the **Symmetry Argument** because it seems like a neat solution. But to be sure, I might need to explore a bit more. Let's see if this strategy works.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Symmetry Approach**\n\n**Step 1: Total Number of Arrangements**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of distinct \\(5\\)-digit integers using the digits \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total arrangements} = 5! = 120\n\\]\n\n*Reflection:* Okay, that makes sense. There are \\(120\\) different ways to arrange five distinct digits.\n\n**Step 2: Symmetrical Positions of \\(1\\) and \\(2\\)**\n\nNow, think about the positions of \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) within these arrangements. The crucial point is that in **half** of all arrangements, \\(1\\) will be to the left of \\(2\\), and in the other half, \\(1\\) will be to the right of \\(2\\).\n\n*Wait, can I be sure about this?* Yes, because for every arrangement where \\(1\\) is to the left of \\(2\\), there\u2019s a corresponding arrangement where \\(1\\) is to the right of \\(2\\). They are mirror images in terms of the positions of \\(1\\) and \\(2\\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Favorable Arrangements**\n\nSo, if \\(1\\) is to the left of \\(2\\) in half of the total arrangements:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable arrangements} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60\n\\]\n\n*Checking if this makes sense:*\u00a0Does dividing the total by \\(2\\) account for all cases where \\(1\\) is to the left of \\(2\\)? Yes, because the positions of the other digits (\\(3, 4, 5\\)) don\u2019t affect the relative positions of \\(1\\) and \\(2\\).\n\n*I think this is correct, but let's verify with another approach to be sure.*\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Total Arrangements with \\(1\\) to the Left of \\(2\\)**\n\n**Step 4: Combination Method**\n\nLet\u2019s consider **selecting two positions** out of five for \\(1\\) and \\(2\\), ensuring that \\(1\\) is placed in the earlier position than \\(2\\).\n\n1. **Choose 2 positions out of 5:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Assign \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) to these positions:**\n   - There are \\(2!\\) ways to assign \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) to the selected positions, but since \\(1\\) must be before \\(2\\), we only need 1 way.\n\n3. **Arrange the remaining digits (\\(3, 4, 5\\)):**\n   \\[\n   3! = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total arrangements with \\(1\\) to the left of \\(2\\):**\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 1 \\times 6 = 60\n   \\]\n\n*Reflection:*\u00a0Wait, this seems to confirm our earlier conclusion. Both methods yield **60** favorable arrangements.\n\n*Checking:* Are there any missing cases? No, because this method also considers all possible positions for \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) while ensuring \\(1\\) is left of \\(2\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Step 5: Verifying the Total**\n\nLet\u2019s ensure that the total number of favorable arrangements makes sense relative to the total:\n\n- **Total arrangements:** \\(120\\)\n- **Arrangements with \\(1\\) to the left of \\(2\\):** \\(60\\)\n- **Arrangements with \\(1\\) to the right of \\(2\\):** \\(60\\)\n\n*Sum check:* \\(60 + 60 = 120\\), which matches the total number of arrangements.\n\n*Wait, is there anything missing?* No, all cases are accounted for.\n\n**Final Thought:**\u00a0The symmetry argument is robust here. Since every arrangement is equally likely, and the positions of \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) are symmetrical, dividing the total arrangements by \\(2\\) works perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying with multiple approaches, the number of \\(5\\)-digit positive integers where the digit \\(1\\) is to the left of the digit \\(2\\) is **60**.\n\n**",

  "ground_truth": "For the first digit, we have 5 choices, then we have 4 choices left for the second digit, then 3 choices for the third digit, etc. So there are $5!=120$ arrangements of the digits. Notice that for each arrangement with 1 to the left of 2, we can reverse the arrangement so that 2 is to the left of 1. For instance, flipping 31245 results in 54213. So by symmetry, exactly half of the arrangements have 1 to the left of 2. In $\\frac{120}{2}=\\boxed{60}$ integers, the digit 1 is to the left of the digit 2."
