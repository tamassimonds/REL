    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it on paper\u2014brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed. I'll make sure to think out loud, embracing the natural flow of human thinking, including doubts, realizations, and corrections along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see:\n\n- **Murtha's Pebble Collection:** She collects pebbles over 12 days.\n- **Daily Collection Pattern:** Starts with 1 pebble on Day 1, increases by 1 pebble each subsequent day.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis reminds me of arithmetic sequences I've dealt with before. It feels like a pattern where each term (day) adds a fixed amount to the previous one. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the best way to approach it. Maybe I should list out a few days to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **List the Number of Pebbles Collected Each Day:**\n   - This seems straightforward. I can write down how many pebbles Murtha collects each day up to Day 12 and then sum them up.\n   \n2. **Use an Arithmetic Sequence Formula:**\n   - If I confirm it's an arithmetic sequence, I could apply the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total without listing all terms.\n\n3. **Visualize with a Small Example:**\n   - Maybe test my methods with a smaller number of days, like Day 3, to check if the pattern holds before scaling up to Day 12.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nListing the pebbles day by day seems the most intuitive but might be time-consuming for Day 12. Using the arithmetic sequence formula could save time and ensure accuracy. Still, checking with a small example is a good way to validate the approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Trying the Listing Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's start by listing how many pebbles are collected each day for the first few days to see the pattern clearly.\n\n- **Day 1:** 1 pebble\n- **Day 2:** 2 pebbles\n- **Day 3:** 3 pebbles\n- **Day 4:** 4 pebbles\n- **Day 5:** 5 pebbles\n- ...\n- **Day 12:** ?\n\n**Observation:**  \nI see that each day adds one more pebble than the previous day. This aligns with the description, so the pattern seems correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIs this adding up? Let's see\u2014Day 1 has 1, Day 2 has 2, so that's 1 + 2 + 3 + ... up to 12. This looks familiar; it's the sum of the first n natural numbers.\n\n**Realization:**  \nWait, I remember the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n + 1)/2. This could make the calculation easier for Day 12.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Arithmetic Sequence Formula**\n\n**Formula Recall:**  \nThe sum \\(S_n\\) of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence where:\n- the first term \\(a = 1\\),\n- the common difference \\(d = 1\\),\n- and the number of terms \\(n = 12\\),\n\nis given by:\n\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (2a + (n - 1)d) = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (2 \\times 1 + (12 - 1) \\times 1)\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s plug in the numbers.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nS_{12} = \\frac{12}{2} \\times (2 + 11) = 6 \\times 13 = 78\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat seems like a large number, but given the pattern (adding more each day), it makes sense. Let me cross-check by manually summing up a few days to ensure this is on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with a Small Example (Day 1 to Day 5)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore committing to the total for Day 12, let's sum the pebbles for the first five days using both methods to verify.\n\n**Listing Method:**\n- Day 1: 1\n- Day 2: 2\n- Day 3: 3\n- Day 4: 4\n- Day 5: 5\n\n**Sum:**  \n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\n\n**Arithmetic Sequence Formula:**\n\n\\[\nS_5 = \\frac{5}{2} \\times (2 \\times 1 + (5 - 1) \\times 1) = \\frac{5}{2} \\times (2 + 4) = \\frac{5}{2} \\times 6 = 15\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nBoth methods agree\u201415 pebbles for the first five days.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis consistency gives me confidence that the formula is correct. Let's proceed with it for Day 12.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Calculation for Day 12 Using the Formula**\n\n**Applying the Formula Again:**\n\n\\[\nS_{12} = \\frac{12}{2} \\times (2 \\times 1 + (12 - 1) \\times 1) = 6 \\times (2 + 11) = 6 \\times 13 = 78\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nMurtha will have collected **78 pebbles** by the end of the twelfth day.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Quick Check for Reasonableness**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nDoes 78 pebbles seem reasonable given the collection pattern?\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet's see\u2014Day 1 has 1 pebble, Day 2 has 2, Day 3 has 3, and so on up to Day 12 with 12 pebbles. The total is the sum of the first 12 natural numbers, which we've calculated as 78. This aligns with the arithmetic sequence formula, and our small example verification supports it. So, 78 pebbles seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Considering Alternative Approaches**\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nIs there another method I could use to verify the total or perhaps simplify the calculation?\n\n1. **Grouping Strategy:**  \n   Pair days to simplify addition:\n   - (Day 1 + Day 12): 1 + 12 = 13\n   - (Day 2 + Day 11): 2 + 11 = 13\n   - ...\n   - (Day 6 + Day 7): 6 + 7 = 13\n\n   **Pairing Observation:**  \n   There are six pairs, each summing to 13, so:\n\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 13 = 78\n   \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis method also gives 78 pebbles, confirming the original calculation.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIt's always good to have multiple strategies to verify an answer. The grouping method aligns with the arithmetic sequence sum and provides a quick check.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThroughout this process, I started by listing the collection pattern to identify it's an arithmetic sequence, which led me to apply the sum formula. Verifying with a smaller example ensured accuracy, and considering alternative approaches, like pairing days, confirmed the total.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:** Exploring different methods helps verify correctness.\n- **Verification Steps:** Checking calculations with smaller examples builds confidence.\n- **Alternative Approaches:** Looking for simpler or quicker methods can streamline problem-solving.\n\nBy continually reflecting and adjusting the approach as needed, I arrived confidently at the solution: Murtha will have collected **78 pebbles** by the end of the twelfth day.",
