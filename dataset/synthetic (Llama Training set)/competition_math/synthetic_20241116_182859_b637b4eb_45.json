    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem just like how I would approach it as a human. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their efficacy, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach whenever I hit a roadblock.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Alright, we have a function \\( f \\) defined by two conditions: \\( f(3) = 1 \\) and \\( f(2x) = 2f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n- We need to find \\( f^{-1}(64) \\), which means we're looking for an \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 64 \\).\n  \n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - Use the functional equation \\( f(2x) = 2f(x) \\) to find more values of \\( f \\).\n  - Try to express \\( f(x) \\) in terms of \\( f(3) \\).\n  - See if the function resembles exponential or linear patterns.\n  \n- **Recalling Similar Problems:**\n  - This reminds me of problems involving exponential functions where \\( f(2x) \\) relates to \\( f(x) \\). Maybe \\( f(x) \\) is exponential?\n  \n- **Uncertainties:**\n  - I'm not sure if \\( f(x) \\) is linear or exponential just yet. Need to explore further.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Checking if starting with \\( f(3) = 1 \\) helps. Since 3 is involved, maybe I can relate other values to 3.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the Functional Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's use the equation \\( f(2x) = 2f(x) \\) to find \\( f(1.5) \\). Maybe this will help relate \\( f(3) \\) to other values.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Attempt 1:**\n  - Let \\( x = 1.5 \\):\n    \\[\n    f(3) = 2f(1.5) \\implies 1 = 2f(1.5) \\implies f(1.5) = \\frac{1}{2}\n    \\]\n    \n  - **Check:**\n    - Wait, but I initialized \\( x = 1.5 \\) which isn't directly linked to \\( f(3) = 1 \\). Need to backtrack.\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - This doesn't seem right because I'm introducing a value not initially given. Maybe I should stick to using the known value \\( f(3) = 1 \\).\n\n**Reconsidering:**\n\n- Perhaps starting with a different known value would be better. But I only have \\( f(3) = 1 \\) to begin with.\n\n- **Possible Alternative:**\n  - Try to find a pattern or a sequence by repeatedly applying the functional equation.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n- Use the functional equation iteratively to find values starting from \\( f(3) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Functional Equation Iteratively**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's apply \\( f(2x) = 2f(x) \\) repeatedly, starting from \\( f(3) = 1 \\), to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Step 1: Find \\( f(6) \\)**\n  \\[\n  f(6) = f(2 \\times 3) = 2f(3) = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Step 2: Find \\( f(12) \\)**\n  \\[\n  f(12) = f(2 \\times 6) = 2f(6) = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Step 3: Find \\( f(24) \\)**\n  \\[\n  f(24) = f(2 \\times 12) = 2f(12) = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n  \\]\n  \n- **Step 4: Find \\( f(48) \\)**\n  \\[\n  f(48) = f(2 \\times 24) = 2f(24) = 2 \\times 8 = 16\n  \\]\n  \n- **Step 5: Find \\( f(96) \\)**\n  \\[\n  f(96) = f(2 \\times 48) = 2f(48) = 2 \\times 16 = 32\n  \\]\n  \n- **Step 6: Find \\( f(192) \\)**\n  \\[\n  f(192) = f(2 \\times 96) = 2f(96) = 2 \\times 32 = 64\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:**\n  - Wait a minute! I've reached \\( f(192) = 64 \\). This seems to align with our goal.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- By repeatedly applying the functional equation, I reached \\( f(192) = 64 \\). Let me check if this makes sense.\n\n- **Checking the Pattern:**\n  - Each step multiplies the previous \\( f(x) \\) by 2.\n  - Starting from \\( f(3) = 1 \\), the sequence is \\( 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 \\).\n\n- **Observation:**\n  - This is a geometric sequence where each term is double the previous one.\n\n- **Conclusion:**\n  - It seems correct. \\( f(192) = 64 \\) fits the pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Before finalizing, let's double-check if \\( f(192) = 64 \\) satisfies both conditions given in the problem.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Condition 1:** \\( f(3) = 1 \\) \u2192 Confirmed.\n- **Condition 2:** \\( f(2x) = 2f(x) \\) \u2192 Check if applied correctly.\n\n- Let's verify a few steps:\n  - From \\( f(3) = 1 \\), \\( f(6) = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\).\n  - \\( f(12) = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\).\n  - \\( f(24) = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\).\n  - \\( f(48) = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\).\n  - \\( f(96) = 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\).\n  - \\( f(192) = 2 \\times 32 = 64 \\).\n\n- **All Steps Check Out:**\n  - Each value satisfies \\( f(2x) = 2f(x) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Everything aligns perfectly. The pattern holds, and the functional equation is satisfied at every step.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nf^{-1}(64) = 192\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- By systematically applying the functional equation, I was able to trace back from \\( f(192) = 64 \\) to find that \\( f^{-1}(64) = 192 \\).\n- Initially, I considered starting with \\( f(1.5) \\), but realized it complicated things. Instead, sticking to the known value \\( f(3) = 1 \\) and building up was more effective.\n- Throughout the process, I checked each step to ensure the consistency of the functional equation, confirming that the solution is correct.\n\n- **Lessons Learned:**\n  - When dealing with functional equations, identifying a repeatable pattern can be key.\n  - It's crucial to verify each step, especially when iterating through multiple values.\n  - Reflecting and being willing to pivot your strategy helps in avoiding dead ends and ensuring accuracy.\n\nThis approach mimics natural human problem-solving, integrating brainstorming, iterative calculations, reflections, and constant checks to arrive at the correct solution.",
