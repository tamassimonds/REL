    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I would naturally approach it if I were solving it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on them, and check my work regularly to ensure everything makes sense. Let's see where this takes us!\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see that it involves **marbles of different colors**: red, yellow, orange, and white. There's a total of **35 marbles** in the bag. \n\nThe relationships given are quite specific:\n- Half the number of **red marbles** equals:\n  - Two less than the number of **yellow marbles**.\n  - A third of the number of **orange marbles**.\n  - A third of three more than the number of **white marbles**.\n\n**Initial Reaction**: This reminds me of systems of equations, where we have multiple variables and their interrelationships. But honestly, the wording is a bit tricky, so I'm not entirely sure how to set it up right away.\n\n**Possible Strategies**:\n1. **Set Up Equations**: I could assign variables to each color and set up equations based on the relationships.\n2. **Use Proportional Relationships**: Maybe look at the fractional relationships to simplify things.\n3. **Trial and Error**: Perhaps try guessing some values and see if they fit, though this might be time-consuming.\n\n### **Step 1: Brainstorming \u2014 Setting Up Variables**\n\nI think the first strategy makes the most sense: assigning variables to each color and setting up equations. This way, I can systematically solve for the number of red marbles.\n\n**Let\u2019s assign variables**:\n- Let \\( R \\) = number of red marbles\n- \\( Y \\) = number of yellow marbles\n- \\( O \\) = number of orange marbles\n- \\( W \\) = number of white marbles\n\n**Total Marbles Equation**:\n\\[ \nR + Y + O + W = 35 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Okay, this gives me a starting point. I have one equation. But I'll need more to connect the relationships provided in the problem.\n\n### **Step 2: Translating Relationships into Equations**\n\nNow, let's take each relationship and convert them into equations.\n\n1. **Half the Number of Red Equals Two Less than Yellow**:\n   \\[ \n\\frac{1}{2} R = Y - 2 \n   \\]\n   \u2192 Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[ \nR = 2Y - 4 \n   \\]\n   \n2. **Half the Number of Red Equals a Third of Orange**:\n   \\[ \n\\frac{1}{2} R = \\frac{1}{3} O \n   \\]\n   \u2192 Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate fractions:\n   \\[ \n3R = 2O \n   \\]\n   \n3. **Half the Number of Red Equals a Third of Three More than White**:\n   \\[ \n\\frac{1}{2} R = \\frac{1}{3} (W + 3) \n   \\]\n   \u2192 Multiply both sides by 6:\n   \\[ \n3R = 2(W + 3) \n   \\]\n   \u2192 Expand:\n   \\[ \n3R = 2W + 6 \n   \\]\n\n**Reflection**: Now I have three equations:\n1. \\( R = 2Y - 4 \\)\n2. \\( 3R = 2O \\)\n3. \\( 3R = 2W + 6 \\)\n\n**Check**: These look correct based on the problem's statements. Each relationship has been converted properly.\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the System of Equations**\n\nI need to solve this system to find the value of \\( R \\). But first, let's see if we can simplify or relate these equations better.\n\n**Consider Equations 2 and 3**:\n\\[ \n3R = 2O \n\\]\n\\[ \n3R = 2W + 6 \n\\]\n\nSince both equal \\( 3R \\), I can set them equal to each other:\n\\[ \n2O = 2W + 6 \n\\]\n\n**Simplify**:\n\\[ \n2O - 2W = 6 \n\\]\n\\[ \nO - W = 3 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: This gives me a direct relationship between the number of orange and white marbles. That\u2019s useful!\n\n### **Step 4: Substituting Back into the Total Marbles Equation**\n\nNow, I have:\n1. \\( R = 2Y - 4 \\)\n2. \\( O - W = 3 \\)\n3. Plus, the total marbles equation: \\( R + Y + O + W = 35 \\)\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\( O = W + 3 \\) into the total marbles equation:\n\\[ \nR + Y + (W + 3) + W = 35 \n\\]\n\\[ \nR + Y + 2W + 3 = 35 \n\\]\n\\[ \nR + Y + 2W = 32 \n\\]   \u21d0  **Equation A**\n\n**Reflection**: Now I have a simpler equation. But I still have two variables (\\( R \\), \\( Y \\), \\( W \\)) and only one equation. I need to find another relationship.\n\n### **Step 5: Substituting \\( O = W + 3 \\) into Equation 2**\n\nRecall:\n\\[ \n3R = 2O \n\\]\n\nBut from Step 4, there's no direct link to \\( Y \\) yet. So, I need to express \\( O \\) in terms of other variables.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ \nO - W = 3 \\implies O = W + 3 \n\\]\n\nSubstitute into \\( 3R = 2O \\):\n\\[ \n3R = 2(W + 3) \n\\]\n\\[ \n3R = 2W + 6 \n\\]   \u21d0  **Equation B**\n\n**Check**: Wait a moment\u2014Equation B is the same as part of Equation A. So, this isn't adding new information. I need another approach.\n\n### **Step 6: Finding Another Relationship**\n\nRealizing that Equation B doesn\u2019t help, I should use the relationship involving \\( Y \\).\n\nFrom:\n\\[ \nR = 2Y - 4 \n\\]\n\nSubstitute into Equation A:\n\\[ \n(2Y - 4) + Y + 2W = 32 \n\\]\n\\[ \n3Y + 2W - 4 = 32 \n\\]\n\\[ \n3Y + 2W = 36 \n\\]   \u21d0  **Equation C**\n\n**Reflection**: Now I have Equation C: \\( 3Y + 2W = 36 \\) alongside Equation A: \\( R + Y + 2W = 32 \\).\n\n**Check**: Let's see if I can solve for \\( R \\), \\( Y \\), and \\( W \\) using these equations.\n\n### **Step 7: Solving the System of Equations**\n\nNow, I have:\n1. \\( R + Y + 2W = 32 \\)  (Equation A)\n2. \\( 3Y + 2W = 36 \\)     (Equation C)\n\n**Let's solve for \\( Y \\) and \\( W \\) first**, then find \\( R \\).\n\n**Substitute** Equation A into Equation C:\n\nFrom A:\n\\[ \nR = 32 - Y - 2W \n\\]\n\nSubstitute into C:\n\\[ \n3Y + 2W = 36 \n\\]\n\nBut wait\u2014this doesn\u2019t directly help. Maybe I should attempt to eliminate one variable instead.\n\n**Alternative Idea**: Let\u2019s eliminate \\( W \\).\n\n\\[\nR + Y + 2W = 32 \n\\]\n\\[\n3Y + 2W = 36 \n\\]\n\n**Subtract the second equation from the first**:\n\n\\[\n(R + Y + 2W) - (3Y + 2W) = 32 - 36 \n\\]\n\\[\nR - 2Y = -4 \n\\]\n\\[\nR = 2Y - 4 \n\\]   \u21d0  **This is the same as our initial equation!**\n\n**Reflection**: This isn\u2019t helpful. It just brings me back to the starting point. I need to find another way.\n\n### **Step 8: Leveraging the Orange and White Relationship**\n\nRecall:\n\\[ \nO - W = 3 \\implies O = W + 3 \n\\]\n\nAlso, from Equation B:\n\\[ \n3R = 2O \\implies O = \\frac{3R}{2} \n\\]\n\n**Set them equal**:\n\\[ \n\\frac{3R}{2} = W + 3 \n\\]\n\n**Solve for \\( R \\)**:\n\\[ \n3R = 2(W + 3) \n\\]\n\\[ \n3R = 2W + 6 \n\\]\n\\[ \nR = \\frac{2W + 6}{3} \n\\]   \u21d0  **Equation D**\n\n**Reflection**: Now I have \\( R \\) expressed in terms of \\( W \\). This might help me find the solution.\n\n### **Step 9: Substituting Back into the Total Marbles Equation**\n\nRecall:\n\\[ \nR + Y + O + W = 35 \n\\]\n\\[ \nR + Y + (W + 3) + W = 35 \n\\]\n\\[ \nR + Y + 2W + 3 = 35 \n\\]\n\\[ \nR + Y + 2W = 32 \n\\]   \u21d0  **Equation A**\n\nWe now have Equation A and Equation D:\n\\[ \nR = \\frac{2W + 6}{3} \n\\]\n\n**Substitute \\( R \\) from Equation D into Equation A**:\n\\[ \n\\frac{2W + 6}{3} + Y + 2W = 32 \n\\]\n\n**Multiply everything by 3 to eliminate the fraction**:\n\\[ \n2W + 6 + 3Y + 6W = 96 \n\\]\n\\[ \n8W + 3Y + 6 = 96 \n\\]\n\\[ \n8W + 3Y = 90 \n\\]   \u21d0  **Equation E**\n\n**Reflection**: Now I have Equation E: \\( 8W + 3Y = 90 \\). Alongside Equation C: \\( 3Y + 2W = 36 \\), I can solve for \\( Y \\) and \\( W \\).\n\n### **Step 10: Solving Equations C and E Simultaneously**\n\nWe have:\n1. \\( 3Y + 2W = 36 \\)  (Equation C)\n2. \\( 8W + 3Y = 90 \\)  (Equation E)\n\n**To solve, let's align the equations**. Multiply Equation C by 4 to match the coefficient of \\( Y \\) in Equation E:\n\n\\[\n4(3Y + 2W) = 4(36) \n\\]\n\\[\n12Y + 8W = 144 \n\\]   \u21d0  **Equation F**\n\n**Now, subtract Equation E from Equation F**:\n\n\\[\n(12Y + 8W) - (8W + 3Y) = 144 - 90 \n\\]\n\\[\n12Y + 8W - 8W - 3Y = 54 \n\\]\n\\[\n9Y = 54 \n\\]\n\\[\nY = 6 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Wait, \\( Y = 6 \\)? That seems like a small number. Let me quickly check if this makes sense.\n\n**Quick Check**: Does \\( Y = 6 \\) fit into the equations?\n\n**Equation C**:\n\\[\n3Y + 2W = 36 \n\\]\n\\[\n3(6) + 2W = 36 \n\\]\n\\[\n18 + 2W = 36 \n\\]\n\\[\n2W = 18 \n\\]\n\\[\nW = 9 \n\\]\n\n**Equation D**:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{2W + 6}{3} \n\\]\n\\[\nR = \\frac{2(9) + 6}{3} \n\\]\n\\[\nR = \\frac{18 + 6}{3} \n\\]\n\\[\nR = \\frac{24}{3} \n\\]\n\\[\nR = 8 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Okay, so \\( R = 8 \\), \\( Y = 6 \\), and \\( W = 9 \\). Let\u2019s see if these values satisfy all the original conditions.\n\n### **Step 11: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Total Marbles**:\n\\[\nR + Y + O + W = 35 \n\\]\n\\[\n8 + 6 + O + 9 = 35 \n\\]\n\\[\n23 + O = 35 \n\\]\n\\[\nO = 12 \n\\]\n\n**Check the Relationships**:\n\n1. **Half the Number of Red Equals Two Less than Yellow**:\n   \\[\n\\frac{1}{2} R = Y - 2 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(8) = 6 - 2 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n4 = 4 \\quad \\text{(True)} \n   \\]\n\n2. **Half the Number of Red Equals a Third of Orange**:\n   \\[\n\\frac{1}{2} R = \\frac{1}{3} O \n   \\]\n   \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(8) = \\frac{1}{3}(12) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n4 = 4 \\quad \\text{(True)} \n   \\]\n\n3. **Half the Number of Red Equals a Third of Three More than White**:\n   \\[\n\\frac{1}{2} R = \\frac{1}{3} (W + 3) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(8) = \\frac{1}{3} (9 + 3) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n4 = 4 \\quad \\text{(True)} \n   \\]\n\n**Reflection**: All the conditions are satisfied with these values. So, the solution makes sense.\n\n### **Step 12: Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully examining the relationships, setting up the appropriate equations, and solving the system of equations, I conclude that:\n\n**There are 8 red marbles in the bag.**\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout this problem, it was essential to:\n- **Brainstorm different strategies**: Initially, I thought about setting up equations or using trial and error.\n- **Check and verify at each step**: After solving for \\( Y \\) and \\( W \\), I quickly checked if these values made sense in the context of the problem.\n- **Adapt the approach when stuck**: When the elimination method didn't lead me forward, I looked for alternative relationships between the variables.\n- **Ensure all conditions are satisfied**: Verifying that all the given relationships hold true with the final values ensured the solution's correctness.\n\nBy following these steps and maintaining a reflective mindset, I arrived at the correct number of red marbles\u2014**8**.",

We can express the information given in the problem by the following system of linear equations:  \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &= 35\\\\\n\\frac{a}{2} = b - 2 = \\frac{c}{3} &= \\frac{d+3}{3}\n\\end{align*} Using the second expression, we can solve for $a$, $c$, and $d$ in terms of $b$:\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 2b - 4,\\\\\nc &= 3b - 6, \\\\\nd &= 3b - 9\n\\end{align*} Putting these values into the first equation gives $2b - 4 + b + 3b - 6 + 3b - 9 = 35$, so $b = 6$.
