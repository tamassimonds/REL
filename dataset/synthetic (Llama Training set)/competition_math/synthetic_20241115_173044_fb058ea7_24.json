    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming along the way, just like a human would. I'll start by exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, I see two squares, A and B.  \n- **Square A** has a perimeter of **24 cm**.  \n- **Square B** has an area equal to **one-fourth** the area of **Square A**.  \n- The goal is to find the **perimeter** of **Square B**.\n\nHmm, so Square B has an area that's one-fourth of Square A's area. That seems straightforward, but I need to connect perimeter and area to figure it out.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Strategy 1:** Calculate the side length of Square A from its perimeter, then find its area.\n- **Strategy 2:** Determine the relationship between the perimeters and areas of the squares.\n- **Strategy 3:** Use the properties of squares to find the side lengths directly.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\nCalculating the side length of Square A from its perimeter sounds like a solid starting point. From there, I can find the area of Square A and determine the area of Square B. Finally, I'll find Square B's perimeter.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Side Length of Square A**\n\n**Reflecting on Strategy 1:**\nTo find the side length of Square A, I recall that the perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. Since all sides are equal, the perimeter \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = 4 \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\nGiven \\( P = 24 \\, \\text{cm} \\):\n\n\\[\n4 \\times \\text{side length} = 24 \\implies \\text{side length} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\nDoes this make sense?  \nYes, because \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\, \\text{cm} \\), which matches the given perimeter of Square A.\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Area of Square A**\n\n**Strategy 1 Continues:**\nNow that I have the side length of Square A, I can find its area \\( A_A \\):\n\n\\[\nA_A = \\text{side length}^2 = 6^2 = 36 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThat seems correct. Squaring the side length gives the area.\n\n### **Step 4: Determining the Area of Square B**\n\n**Introducing Strategy 1 with a Twist:**\nSquare B's area \\( A_B \\) is one-fourth the area of Square A:\n\n\\[\nA_B = \\frac{1}{4} \\times A_A = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 36 = 9 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\nIs one-fourth of 36 indeed 9?  \nYes, \\( \\frac{36}{4} = 9 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\).\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Side Length of Square B**\n\n**Applying Strategy 1 Again:**\nTo find the side length of Square B, I use the formula for the area of a square:\n\n\\[\nA_B = \\text{side length}_B^2\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\nGiven \\( A_B = 9 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{side length}_B = \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, this feels right because squaring 3 gives 9, which matches the area of Square B.\n\n### **Step 6: Finding the Perimeter of Square B**\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nNow, to find the perimeter \\( P_B \\) of Square B:\n\n\\[\nP_B = 4 \\times \\text{side length}_B = 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nLet me double-check this.  \n- The side length of Square B is 3 cm.  \n- Multiplying by 4 should give the perimeter.\n\n**Quick Check:**\nDoes \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\, \\text{cm} \\)?  \nYes, it does.\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying the Entire Process**\n\n**Reflecting on the Approach:**\n- **Calculating Square A's side length** from the perimeter was straightforward.\n- **Finding Square A's area** by squaring the side length made sense.\n- **Determining Square B's area** as one-fourth of Square A's area was correctly applied.\n- **Calculating Square B's side length** by taking the square root of its area was accurate.\n- **Finding Square B's perimeter** followed logically from its side length.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nEverything checks out. Each step logically followed the previous one, and the calculations align with the given conditions.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe perimeter of **Square B** is \\(\\boxed{12 \\, \\text{cm}}\\).\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem step by step, reflecting on each stage, and verifying calculations, I've ensured a thorough and accurate solution. This method mirrors natural human problem-solving, where brainstorming, checking, and adjusting strategies lead to the correct answer.",

  "ground_truth": "Since square $A$ has a perimeter of 24 cm and all its sides are equal in length, each side measures $24/4=6$ cm. The area of square $A$ is thus $6\\cdot6=36$ square cm. Thus, the area of square $B$ is $36/4=9$ square cm. So each side of square $B$ measures $\\sqrt{9}=3$ cm. Finally, the perimeter of square $B$ is $4\\cdot3=\\boxed{12}$ cm."
