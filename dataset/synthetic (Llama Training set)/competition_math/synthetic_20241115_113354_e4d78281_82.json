    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking natural human thought processes. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, exploring each step thoroughly, checking my work often, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's see where this journey takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, looking at the equation \\( y = -16t^2 + 26t + 105 \\), I remember it's a quadratic equation because of the \\( t^2 \\) term. Quadratics often involve finding the roots or solutions, which typically means the value of \\( t \\) when \\( y = 0 \\). \n\nInitial ideas:\n- **Solve for \\( t \\) by setting \\( y = 0 \\):** This is a common approach to find when the ball hits the ground.\n- **Use the quadratic formula:** Since it's a quadratic equation, the quadratic formula might be the way to go.\n- **Factor the equation if possible:** Maybe it's factorable, which could simplify things.\n- **Check vertex or maximum height:** Though not directly needed, knowing the vertex could provide insights, but I think it's not essential for this problem.\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards using the **quadratic formula** because that\u2019s a reliable method for finding the roots of any quadratic equation. But I\u2019ll keep an eye out for other possibilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Attempting to Factor the Equation:**\n   - **Thinking:** Maybe I can factor \\( -16t^2 + 26t + 105 \\) to find the roots more easily.\n   - **Quick factor check:** I need two numbers that multiply to \\( 4 \\times 105 = 420 \\) (since \\( -16 \\times 105 = -1680 \\)) and add up to \\( 26 \\).\n   - **Reflection:** Wait, that\u2019s a pretty large number. Multiplying to \\( 420 \\) and adding up to \\( 26 \\) doesn't seem straightforward. Maybe factoring isn't the best route.\n\n   **Conclusion:** Factoring looks messy here, so I\u2019ll move on.\n\n2. **Using the Quadratic Formula:**\n   - **Thinking:** The quadratic formula is \\( t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\). This should work since I know the coefficients.\n   - **Coefficients identified:** \\( a = -16 \\), \\( b = 26 \\), \\( c = 105 \\).\n   - **Reflection:** This seems straightforward. Let's calculate the discriminant and see if it leads us to a real solution.\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - **Thinking:** Plotting the equation can visually show me when it hits the ground (the x-intercepts).\n   - **Reflection:** While useful, I don't have graphing tools here, and it might take more time than necessary. Plus, I need a precise decimal answer, which is easier with the quadratic formula.\n\n   **Conclusion:** The quadratic formula is looking like the most efficient method.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with the Quadratic Formula**\n\nLet\u2019s go step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   a = -16, \\quad b = 26, \\quad c = 105\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the discriminant (\\( b^2 - 4ac \\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discriminant} = 26^2 - 4 \\times (-16) \\times 105\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 676 + 6720\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 7396\n   \\]\n   \n   **Checking:** Wait, \\( 7396 \\) is a positive number, which means we'll have two real solutions. That\u2019s a good sign.\n\n3. **Applying the quadratic formula:**\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{-26 \\pm \\sqrt{7396}}{2 \\times (-16)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{-26 \\pm 86}{-32}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:** Okay, now we have two possible values for \\( t \\):\n\n   - \\( t_1 = \\frac{60}{-32} = -1.875 \\)\n   - \\( t_2 = \\frac{-112}{-32} = 3.5 \\)\n\n4. **Interpreting the solutions:**\n   - **Negative \\( t \\) (i.e., \\( t = -1.875 \\)):** This doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Time cannot be negative, so we discard \\( t = -1.875 \\).\n   - **Positive \\( t \\) (i.e., \\( t = 3.5 \\)):** This is our valid solution.\n\n   **Checking:** Wait, does \\( 3.5 \\) seconds fit the scenario? Let\u2019s see. It's a reasonable time for a ball to fall from 105 feet with an initial upward velocity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter working through the quadratic formula and discarding the non-physical solution, we arrive at:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3.5} \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Rounding Check:** The problem asks for the answer rounded to the nearest tenth, and \\( 3.5 \\) is already in that format, so we're good.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Does the solution make sense?** Yes, a ball would take about 3.5 seconds to hit the ground from a height of 105 feet with an upward velocity of 26 feet per second.\n- **Quick check:** I calculated the discriminant and applied the quadratic formula correctly. The negative \\( t \\) was appropriately discarded.\n- **Is there another method that could have been easier?** Factoring seemed cumbersome, and since the quadratic formula provided a clear path with accurate results, I\u2019m satisfied with this approach.\n- **Did I catch any mistakes early?** Initially considering factoring helped realize it wouldn\u2019t be straightforward, prompting a switch to the quadratic formula, which streamlined the process.\n\nOverall, by brainstorming, exploring different strategies, continually reflecting, and checking my work, I confidently arrived at the solution.",
