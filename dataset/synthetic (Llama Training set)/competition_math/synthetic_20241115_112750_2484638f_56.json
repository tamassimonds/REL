    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle the problem of finding the greatest prime factor of 3105 step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each approach, and adjust my thinking as needed\u2014just like a human would when solving a problem. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, **What is the greatest prime factor of 3105?** \n\n- **Initial Brainstorming**: \n  - My first thought is that this involves **prime factorization**\u2014breaking down 3105 into its prime components. \n  - It reminds me of problems where I need to identify the largest prime in a composite number.\n  - Another strategy could be **checking divisibility by smaller prime numbers** to see which ones divide 3105 evenly.\n  - Alternatively, perhaps **using the quadratic formula** or factoring by grouping, but those seem less relevant here since we\u2019re dealing with prime factors, not equations.\n\n- **Reflecting**: \n  - Prime factorization feels like the most straightforward approach. \n  - Checking divisibility by primes like 2, 3, 5, etc., seems logical.\n  - Wait, is 3105 an even number? If not, that eliminates 2 as a potential prime factor right away.\n\n- **Conclusion**: \n  - Let\u2019s start with **divisibility tests** using smaller primes and see where that leads. If it gets messy, I\u2019ll reconsider and perhaps look for patterns or use another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Checking Divisibility by 2**\n\n- **Thought Process**: \n  - Since 2 is the smallest prime, I should check if 3105 is even. \n  - If it's even, then 2 is a factor. If not, move to the next prime.\n\n- **Checking**: \n  - **Is 3105 even?**\n  - **Reflection**: \n    - I remember that even numbers end with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n    - 3105 ends with 5, which is odd.\n\n- **Conclusion**: \n  - **Wait, that can't be right because 3105 is odd**, so 2 is not a factor.\n  - **Realization**: Need to move on to the next prime.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Checking Divisibility by 3**\n\n- **Thought Process**: \n  - The next smallest prime after 2 is 3.\n  - A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\n- **Calculations**: \n  - **Sum of digits in 3105**: 3 + 1 + 0 + 5 = 9\n  - **Reflection**: \n    - 9 is divisible by 3.\n\n- **Conclusion**: \n  - **Oh! This reminds me that 3 is a prime factor.**\n  - **Check**: Let\u2019s divide 3105 by 3 to see the quotient.\n\n- **Division**: \n  - 3105 \u00f7 3 = 1035\n\n- **Interim Check**: \n  - **Is 1035 divisible by 3?** \n  - Sum of digits: 1 + 0 + 3 + 5 = 9 \u2192 Divisible by 3\n  - **Divide again**: 1035 \u00f7 3 = 345\n\n- **Reflection**: \n  - Continuing to divide by 3 gives: \n    - 345 \u00f7 3 = 115 \n    - 115 \u00f7 3 = 38.33 (not an integer)\n\n- **Conclusion**: \n  - **Wait, that can\u2019t be right because 115 is not divisible by 3 again.**\n  - **Insight**: Perhaps factor out 3 twice and see what remains.\n\n- **Revised Approach**: \n  - Let\u2019s factor 3105 as 3 x 3 x 115, or \\(3^2 \\times 115\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Factoring 115 Further**\n\n- **Thought Process**: \n  - Now, let\u2019s see if 115 can be factored further into primes.\n  - **Brainstorm**: Is 115 divisible by 5? I remember primes end in 0, 1, 3, 7, or 9 (except 2 and 5).\n\n- **Checking Divisibility by 5**: \n  - **Reflection**: \n    - 115 ends with a 5, so it\u2019s divisible by 5.\n\n- **Division**: \n  - 115 \u00f7 5 = 23\n\n- **Interim Check**: \n  - **Is 23 a prime number?**\n  - **Recall**: 23 is greater than 2 and not divisible by any primes up to its square root (which is about 4.79, primes are 2, 3).\n\n- **Conclusion**: \n  - **Ah! 23 is prime.**\n  - **So, 115 = 5 x 23.**\n\n- **Factorization So Far**: \n  - 3105 = \\(3^2 \\times 5 \\times 23\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying the Greatest Prime Factor**\n\n- **Thought Process**: \n  - Now that we have the complete prime factorization, the greatest prime factor is the largest number in the list.\n  - **List of Primes**: 3, 5, 23\n  - **Reflection**: \n    - Wait, there\u2019s an exponent with 3. Does that make it larger somehow? No, exponents affect multiplicity, not the base primes themselves.\n\n- **Conclusion**: \n  - **The greatest prime factor is 23.**\n\n- **Final Check**: \n  - Let\u2019s quickly verify the factorization:\n    - 3105 \u00f7 3 = 1035\n    - 1035 \u00f7 3 = 345\n    - 345 \u00f7 5 = 69\n    - 69 \u00f7 3 = 23\n    - 23 is prime.\n\n- **Reflection**: \n  - **All divisibility checks seem correct.**\n  - **The process flowed logically, and each step made sense.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**The greatest prime factor of 3105 is 23.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming Recap**: \n  - Started with checking small primes\u20142 and 3.\n  - Realized 2 wasn\u2019t a factor since 3105 is odd.\n  - Successfully identified 3 and continued factoring down.\n  - Recognized 5 and 23 as remaining prime factors.\n\n- **Reflection**: \n  - Initially thought to factor out 3 repeatedly, which led to an intermediate check that helped solidify the factorization.\n  - By checking divisibility step-by-step, I ensured accuracy in identifying all prime factors.\n  - **Mistake Awareness**: Almost proceeded incorrectly by attempting to divide 115 by 3 again, which was not possible.\n\n- **Final Check**: \n  - Confirmed that 3, 5, and 23 are prime and correctly factor 3105.\n\n- **Insight**: \n  - Prime factorization is effective for such problems.\n  - Divisibility rules are handy for quickly narrowing down potential prime factors.\n  - Always beneficial to reflect and verify each step to avoid small errors.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed step-by-step approach mimics natural human problem-solving, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and checking along the way.
