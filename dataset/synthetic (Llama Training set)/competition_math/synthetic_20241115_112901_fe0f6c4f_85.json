    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work often, and reflect on whether each approach is leading me in the right direction. Let's start by really understanding what's being asked.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. \\( a + b = 8 \\)\n2. \\( b + c = -3 \\)\n3. \\( a + c = -5 \\)\n\nAnd we need to find the value of \\( abc \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Symmetry:** The equations are symmetric in terms of pairs adding up to constants. Maybe I can find a relationship between \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) by adding or subtracting these equations.\n  \n- **Substitution:** Perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the others and substitute it back into the equations.\n\n- **System of Equations:** This looks like a system that can be solved using methods like elimination or substitution.\n\n**Feeling:** This reminds me of solving linear systems, where you combine equations to eliminate variables. Let's explore that approach first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Addition Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe adding all three equations together could give me a sum that relates to \\( a + b + c \\). If I can find \\( a + b + c \\), I can then use it to find individual variables.\n\n**Adding the Equations:**\n\n\\[\n(a + b) + (b + c) + (a + c) = 8 + (-3) + (-5)\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify both sides:\n\n\\[\n2a + 2b + 2c = 0\n\\]\n\n**Simplify:** \n\\[\na + b + c = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nWait, that\u2019s interesting! I found that \\( a + b + c = 0 \\). This gives me a relationship between all three variables. Maybe I can use this to substitute back into the original equations.\n\n**Check:** \n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because if the sum is zero, then knowing two variables can help find the third.\n\n**Next Step:** \n\nLet's use \\( a + b + c = 0 \\) to express one variable in terms of the others.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing Variables in Terms of Each Other**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFrom \\( a + b + c = 0 \\), I can express each variable as:\n\n- \\( c = - (a + b) \\)\n- \\( b = - (a + c) \\)\n- \\( a = - (b + c) \\)\n\nBut, perhaps substituting directly into the original equations might be more straightforward.\n\n**Alternative Approach:** \n\nLet's substitute \\( c = - (a + b) \\) into the second equation \\( b + c = -3 \\) to see if it simplifies things.\n\n**Substituting into \\( b + c = -3 \\):**\n\n\\[\nb + (- (a + b)) = -3\n\\]\n\\[\nb - a - b = -3\n\\]\n\\[\n-a = -3\n\\]\n\\[\na = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \n\nDoes this work? Let me see:\n\n- If \\( a = 3 \\), then \\( a + b = 8 \\) implies \\( 3 + b = 8 \\), so \\( b = 5 \\).\n- Then, \\( b + c = -3 \\) implies \\( 5 + c = -3 \\), so \\( c = -8 \\).\n\n**Calculation Check:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014let's see if these values satisfy all three original equations:\n\n1. \\( a + b = 3 + 5 = 8 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n2. \\( b + c = 5 + (-8) = -3 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n3. \\( a + c = 3 + (-8) = -5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThey satisfy all three equations. **Feeling:** \n\nThis seems correct. By adding the equations, I found a relationship that allowed me to solve for one variable and then the others followed.\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nThis method worked well. Confirming with all three equations ensures that the solution is consistent. \n\n**Next Step:** \n\nNow that I have \\( a = 3 \\), \\( b = 5 \\), and \\( c = -8 \\), I can find the product \\( abc \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Product \\( abc \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), calculating the product should be straightforward. Let\u2019s multiply them together.\n\n\\[\nabc = 3 \\times 5 \\times (-8)\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 5 = 15\n\\]\n\\[\n15 \\times (-8) = -120\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \n\nDoes the sign make sense? Yes, since one of the variables \\( c \\) is negative, the product should be negative.\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nEverything checks out. The values satisfy the original equations, and the product calculation aligns with the signs of the variables.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- By adding all three equations, I found that \\( a + b + c = 0 \\).\n- Substituting this into one of the equations allowed me to solve for \\( a \\), then find \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n- Finally, calculating the product \\( abc \\) gave me \\(-120\\).\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nAt first, I thought about different methods like substitution and elimination. Adding the equations was a straightforward approach that simplified the problem significantly. Checking each step ensured that the solution was correct.\n\n**Alternative Strategy Consideration:** \n\nIf adding the equations didn't lead to a clear path, I might have tried setting up a system for substitution or elimination, but in this case, it worked well.\n\n**Check Before Finalizing:** \n\nIt's always good to verify that the solution satisfies all original equations, which it does here.\n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nThe value of \\( abc \\) is \\(\\boxed{-120}\\).\n\n---\n\nBy reflecting and checking at each stage, I ensured the solution was correct and consistent with the original problem. This step-by-step approach helped navigate through the problem effectively.",

  "ground_truth": "Adding the first given equation to the second, we have $a+2b+c=5$. Then, subtracting the third given equation from this last equation, we get $2b=10$, so $b=5$. Plugging this value of $b$ into the first given equation, we find that $a=3$. Plugging this value of $a$ into the third given equation, we find that $c=-8$. Thus, the product $abc=3\\cdot5\\cdot-8=\\boxed{-120}$."
