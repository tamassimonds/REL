    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to ensure I\u2019m on the right track, and be ready to backtrack or change my approach if something doesn\u2019t seem right. Here we go!\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question:\n\n- **Understanding the Question:**  \n  \u201cIn the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 12, what is the fourth number?\u201d  \n  This immediately makes me think of Pascal\u2019s triangle, where each row represents the coefficients in the binomial expansion. The rows start with 1, and each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. I remember that each row corresponds to the powers of (a + b) in expansions like (a + b)^n.\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**  \n  - **Option 1:** Maybe I should list out the rows of Pascal\u2019s triangle until I find the one starting with 1 and 12.\n  - **Option 2:** Perhaps there\u2019s a formula or property that relates the rows to binomial coefficients, since 12 could represent a binomial coefficient like C(n, k).\n  - **Option 3:** I could abstractly think about the structure of Pascal\u2019s triangle and see if there's a pattern or relationship that would help me identify the fourth number without writing out all the rows.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Listing out the rows seems straightforward but might get tedious. Using a formula could be more efficient. However, I'm not entirely sure which formula to apply right away. Let me explore these options further.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Listing Pascal\u2019s Triangle Rows**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Let\u2019s try to list the rows of Pascal\u2019s triangle and see which one starts with 1 and 12. Maybe the row number corresponds to the power in the binomial expansion, and 12 is one of the coefficients.\n\n- **Starting to List Rows:**\n  - **Row 0:** 1  \n    (Starts with 1)\n  - **Row 1:** 1, 1  \n    (Doesn\u2019t start with 12)\n  - **Row 2:** 1, 2, 1  \n    (Doesn\u2019t start with 12)\n  - **Row 3:** 1, 3, 3, 1  \n    (Doesn\u2019t start with 12)\n  - **Row 4:** 1, 4, 6, 4, 1  \n    (Doesn\u2019t start with 12)\n  - **Row 5:** 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1  \n    (Doesn\u2019t start with 12)\n  - **Row 6:** 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1  \n    (Doesn\u2019t start with 12)\n  - **Row 7:** 1, 7, 21, 35, 35, 21, 7, 1  \n    (Doesn\u2019t start with 12)\n  - **Row 8:** 1, 8, 28, 56, 70, 56, 28, 8, 1  \n    (Doesn\u2019t start with 12)\n  - **Row 9:** 1, 9, 36, 84, 126, 126, 84, 36, 9, 1  \n    (Doesn\u2019t start with 12)\n  - **Row 10:** 1, 10, 45, 120, 210, 252, 210, 120, 45, 10, 1  \n    (Doesn\u2019t start with 12)\n  - **Row 11:** 1, 11, 55, 165, 330, 462, 330, 165, 55, 11, 1  \n    (Doesn\u2019t start with 12)\n  - **Row 12:** 1, 12, 66, 220, 495, 792, 924, 495, 220, 66, 12, 1  \n    **(Starts with 1 and 12!)**\n\n- **Realization:**  \n  Wait a minute! Row 12 starts with 1 and then 12. I had to go all the way to row 12 to find it. This matches the requirement in the question.\n\n- **Next Steps:**  \n  Now that I\u2019ve identified the correct row (row 12), I need to find the fourth number in this row.\n\n### **Determining the Fourth Number in Row 12**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  In Pascal\u2019s triangle, each row's numbers are the coefficients in the expansion of (a + b)^n, where n is the row number. The numbers in row n are the binomial coefficients C(n, k), where k ranges from 0 to n.\n\n  Since row 12 starts with 1 and 12, the numbers likely correspond to C(12, k) for k = 0 to 12.\n\n- **Calculating Binomial Coefficients for Row 12:**\n  - **C(12, 0) = 1**\n  - **C(12, 1) = 12**\n  - **C(12, 2) = 66**\n  - **C(12, 3) = 220**\n  - **C(12, 4) = 495**\n  - **C(12, 5) = 792**\n  - **C(12, 6) = 924**\n  - **C(12, 7) = 792**\n  - **C(12, 8) = 495**\n  - **C(12, 9) = 220**\n  - **C(12, 10) = 66**\n  - **C(12, 11) = 12**\n  - **C(12, 12) = 1**\n\n- **Identifying the Fourth Number:**  \n  From the row:  \n  **1 (C(12, 0)), 12 (C(12, 1)), 66 (C(12, 2)), 220 (C(12, 3)), ...**\n\n  The fourth number is **220**.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Does this make sense? Let me check if the pattern aligns with my expectations. Row 12 indeed has 13 numbers (from C(12, 0) to C(12, 12)), and each number represents a binomial coefficient. The fourth number, C(12, 3), being 220, seems consistent with the pattern.\n\n### **Option 2: Verifying with Binomial Coefficient Formula**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Just to double-check, let\u2019s use the binomial coefficient formula to calculate C(12, 3) and see if it matches our previous result.\n\n- **Binomial Coefficient Formula:**  \n  \\[\n  C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n  \\]  \n  For our case:  \n  \\[\n  C(12, 3) = \\frac{12!}{3!(12-3)!} = \\frac{12!}{3! \\times 9!}\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  - **12! = 479,001,600**\n  - **3! = 6**\n  - **9! = 362,880**\n\n  Plugging these values into the formula:  \n  \\[\n  C(12, 3) = \\frac{479,001,600}{6 \\times 362,880} = \\frac{479,001,600}{2,176,320} = 220\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  The calculation confirms that C(12, 3) = 220. This aligns with our earlier result, so the answer seems correct.\n\n### **Checking the Approach**\n\n- **Checking Consistency:**  \n  I listed Pascal\u2019s triangle rows and identified row 12 where the second number is 12. From there, I correctly found the fourth number as C(12, 3) = 220.\n\n- **Ensuring No Mistakes:**  \n  I initially considered listing all rows, which took time but helped verify the correct row. Using the binomial coefficient formula provided a mathematical confirmation, ensuring the answer is accurate.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy Reflection:**  \n  Initially, I thought there might be a quicker formula directly relating 1 and 12 to specific binomial coefficients. However, listing the rows provided clarity and confirmation. In future problems, if the row number or specific binomial coefficients are given, using the formula directly might save time.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying calculations, and reflecting on the approach, the fourth number in the row of Pascal\u2019s triangle that starts with 1 and then 12 is **220**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap of the Thought Process**\n\n1. **Brainstorming:**  \n   - Started by exploring different methods to identify the correct row in Pascal\u2019s triangle.\n\n2. **Strategy Implementation:**  \n   - List each row until I found row 12, which starts with 1 and 12.\n\n3. **Number Identification:**  \n   - Located the fourth number as C(12, 3) = 220.\n\n4. **Verification:**  \n   - Used the binomial coefficient formula to confirm the calculation.\n\n5. **Reflection and Check:**  \n   - Ensured each step made sense and aligned with Pascal\u2019s triangle properties.\n\n---\n\nThroughout the process, I remained open to changing strategies, reflecting on each step\u2019s correctness, and verifying calculations to ensure the final answer was accurate. This approach not only helped in solving the problem but also in confirming the validity of the solution.",
