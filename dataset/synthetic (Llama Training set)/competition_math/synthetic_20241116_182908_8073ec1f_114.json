    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and checking our work along the way to ensure we're on the right path. I'll write out my thought process as naturally as possible, including exploring various approaches, encountering and correcting mistakes, and having \"aha\" moments. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\cos n^\\circ = \\cos 758^\\circ\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( 0 \\leq n \\leq 180 \\). \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Cosine Function Properties:** I remember that the cosine function is periodic. Specifically, I think it has a period of \\(360^\\circ\\). So, perhaps I can relate \\(758^\\circ\\) to an angle within the standard range by subtracting multiples of \\(360^\\circ\\).\n  \n- **Symmetry in Cosine:** Also, cosine is an even function, meaning \\(\\cos \\theta = \\cos (-\\theta)\\). This might help in finding equivalent angles.\n\n- **Adjusting to the Desired Range:** Since we need \\(n\\) to be between \\(0\\) and \\(180\\), any equivalent angle we find outside this range can be adjusted by adding or subtracting \\(360^\\circ\\) or \\(180^\\circ\\) as needed.\n\n**Uncertainty:**\n- At this point, I'm not entirely sure which approach will be the most straightforward. However, given the periodicity and symmetry properties, adjusting the angle \\(758^\\circ\\) seems like a logical starting point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Periodicity of Cosine**\n\n**Thinking:**\n- The cosine function repeats every \\(360^\\circ\\). So, to find an angle equivalent to \\(758^\\circ\\) within the standard range, I should subtract \\(360^\\circ\\) until the angle falls between \\(0^\\circ\\) and \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n758^\\circ - 360^\\circ = 398^\\circ \\quad (\\text{still greater than } 360^\\circ)\n\\]\n\\[\n398^\\circ - 360^\\circ = 38^\\circ \\quad (\\text{now within } 0^\\circ \\text{ to } 360^\\circ)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- That seems correct because now \\(38^\\circ\\) is within the desired range. But I should double-check if there's another equivalent angle within \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(180^\\circ\\) that might also satisfy the cosine equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering Symmetry of Cosine**\n\n**Thinking:**\n- Given that \\(\\cos \\theta = \\cos (-\\theta)\\), I can also check if the negative of our current angle (\\(38^\\circ\\)) falls within the required range.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\cos 38^\\circ = \\cos (-38^\\circ) \n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{But } -38^\\circ \\text{ is outside } 0^\\circ \\text{ to } 180^\\circ \\text{, so I won't consider it here.}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Since \\(-38^\\circ\\) is outside the range, and we're only looking for \\(n\\) between \\(0^\\circ\\) and \\(180^\\circ\\), \\(38^\\circ\\) is our candidate. \n\n- Wait, let me think: Are there any other angles like \\(180^\\circ - 38^\\circ = 142^\\circ\\) that might also satisfy \\(\\cos n^\\circ = \\cos 758^\\circ\\)?\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\\[\n\\cos 142^\\circ = \\cos (180^\\circ - 38^\\circ) = -\\cos 38^\\circ\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{But } \\cos 758^\\circ \\text{ (or } \\cos 38^\\circ\\text{) is positive, so } \\cos 142^\\circ \\text{ doesn't equal } \\cos 38^\\circ.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Therefore, } n = 38^\\circ \\text{ is the only solution in the desired range.}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thinking:**\n- Before finalizing, let\u2019s double-check if \\(n = 38^\\circ\\) indeed satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\cos 38^\\circ = \\cos 758^\\circ\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{We've already determined that } \\cos 38^\\circ = \\cos 38^\\circ \\text{ (by reducing } 758^\\circ \\text{ to } 38^\\circ\\text{).}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{So, the equation holds true.}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The checks confirm that \\(n = 38^\\circ\\) is correct.\n\n- Alternative methods like using the identity \\(\\cos \\theta = \\cos (360^\\circ - \\theta)\\ weren't necessary here because the first approach already provided a valid solution within the required range.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nn = 38\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring the periodicity and symmetry properties of the cosine function, I was able to determine that \\(n = 38^\\circ\\) is the integer within the specified range that satisfies \\(\\cos n^\\circ = \\cos 758^\\circ\\). Throughout the process, I checked each step to ensure accuracy, considering alternative strategies, and reflecting on whether the approach was correct or needed adjustment.\n\nThis methodical approach\u2014brainstorming, calculating, reflecting, and verifying\u2014ensured a clear and correct solution.",
