I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **User Query:**\n\nWhich of the following has the least value?  \n\\[ A = \\sqrt{2}, \\quad B = \\sqrt[4]{4}, \\quad C = \\sqrt[8]{8} \\]  \n**Enter your answer as \\( A \\), \\( B \\), or \\( C \\).**\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, I see three expressions involving roots of different orders: square root, fourth root, and eighth root. My initial reaction is that this reminds me of comparing exponents or the properties of radicals. \n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Convert to Exponents:** Maybe expressing each root as an exponent will help compare them directly.\n  2. **Decimal Approximations:** Calculate each value numerically to see which is the smallest.\n  3. **Graphical Approach:** Plotting the functions to visually inspect their values.\n  4. **Use of Inequalities:** Applying mathematical inequalities to order them.\n\nHmm, converting to exponents seems like a straightforward approach, so I'll start there. If that doesn't work out, I'll consider decimal approximations or maybe even graphing.\n\nLet's try **Converting to Exponents** first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Express Each Value as an Exponent**\n\n- **Thinking:** By expressing each root as an exponent, I can see if there's a pattern or direct comparison.\n  \n- **Calculations:**\n  \\[\n  A = \\sqrt{2} = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  B = \\sqrt[4]{4} = 4^{\\frac{1}{4}} = (2^2)^{\\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\\frac{2}{4}} = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  C = \\sqrt[8]{8} = 8^{\\frac{1}{8}} = (2^3)^{\\frac{1}{8}} = 2^{\\frac{3}{8}}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Wait a minute! Both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) simplify to \\( 2^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\), which means they are equal. That\u2019s interesting. And \\( C = 2^{\\frac{3}{8}} \\). \n\n- **Check:** Let me double-check the exponents:\n  - \\( B = \\sqrt[4]{4} \\) \u21d2 \\( 4 = 2^2 \\) \u21d2 \\( \\sqrt[4]{4} = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\)\n  - \\( C = \\sqrt[8]{8} \\) \u21d2 \\( 8 = 2^3 \\) \u21d2 \\( \\sqrt[8]{8} = 2^{\\frac{3}{8}} \\)\n\nYep, that\u2019s correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Comparing the Exponents**\n\n- **Thinking:** Since \\( A = B = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\), they are equal. Now, I only need to compare \\( C = 2^{\\frac{3}{8}} \\) with \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n- **Approach:** Recall that for a base greater than 1 (which 2 is), higher exponents yield larger values. So, \\( 2^{\\frac{3}{8}} \\) should be greater than \\( 2^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\).\n\n- **Verification:** Let\u2019s make sure:\n  - \\( \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375 \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\)\n  - Since \\( 0.375 < 0.5 \\), \\( 2^{0.375} < 2^{0.5} \\)\n\n- **Check:** That aligns with the property of exponents: for \\( a > 1 \\) and \\( x < y \\), \\( a^x < a^y \\). \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Final Comparison and Conclusion**\n\n- **Recap:** \n  - \\( A = B = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n  - \\( C = \\sqrt[8]{8} \\)\n\n- **Comparison:**\n  - \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are equal.\n  - \\( C = \\sqrt[8]{8} \\) is less than \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) because the exponent \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) is less than \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n- **Conclusion:** \n  \\[\n  C \\text{ has the least value.}\n  \\]\n  So, the answer is \\( C \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Checks**\n\n- **Is the Answer Correct?** Yes, based on the exponent comparison, \\( \\sqrt[8]{8} \\) is indeed the smallest.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy Reflection:** \n  - **Decimal Approximations:** Calculating \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\), \\( \\sqrt[4]{4} \\approx 1.414 \\), and \\( \\sqrt[8]{8} \\approx 1.296 \\) confirms that \\( C \\) is the smallest.\n  - **Graphical Approach:** Plotting the functions would also visually show that \\( C \\) is less than \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n  \n- **Mistakes and Adjustments:** Initially, I only compared exponents but quickly realized both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) were equal, simplifying the comparison. An alternative method (decimal approximation) further validated the exponent-based conclusion.\n\n- **Reflection:** It\u2019s essential to check and validate each step, especially when multiple strategies are available. This ensures accuracy and builds confidence in the solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**\\( C \\)** has the least value.",
