    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, mimicking a human thought process as closely as possible\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking work, and adjusting strategies along the way. I'll start by trying to understand the problem thoroughly, then explore different strategies, and finally execute the chosen approach while continuously verifying its correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nReading the problem:\n\n**\"Each of the symbols \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\) represents an operation in the set \\(\\{+, -, \\times, \\div\\}\\), and \\(\\frac{12 \\star 2}{9 * 3} = 2\\). What is the value of \\(\\frac{7 \\star 3}{12 * 6}\\)? Express your answer as a common fraction.\"**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like an equation involving operations represented by symbols. It reminds me of problems where you need to determine which operations fit where to make the equation true.\n\n- **Similar Problems:** I've seen problems where you assign operations to letters or symbols to satisfy an equation. It seems related to order of operations and possibly solving for unknowns.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not sure how to start exactly. Do I assume traditional order of operations, or do I need to set up equations for \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\)?\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Assume Standard Order:** Maybe \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\) represent operations that follow standard precedence.\n  2. **Set Up Equations:** Assign possible operations to \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\) and solve the equation.\n  3. **Testing Combinations:** Try different combinations of operations to see which one satisfies the equation.\n\nOkay, let's brainstorm a bit more to decide the direction:\n\n- **Does Assumming Standard Order Make Sense?** If so, the numerator and denominator must independently solve to maintain the equality.\n\n- **Setting Up Equations:** This seems more systematic. Maybe defining \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\) as specific operations and solving could work.\n\n- **Testing Combinations:** This might be time-consuming, but could be practical if the other methods don't pan out.\n\n**Conclusion:** I think starting by assuming standard order might simplify things. If that doesn't work, I'll consider setting up equations. Let's proceed with the standard order approach first.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Assume Standard Order**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Question:** Does standard order of operations apply here?\n- **Reflection:** Typically, operations within the numerator and denominator are resolved first before division. If so, \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\) might be applied before division.\n\n**Step 1:** **Apply Standard Order of Operations**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\star 2}{9 * 3} = 2\n\\]\n\nUnder standard operations, this becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(12 \\star 2)}{(9 * 3)} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Checking if this makes sense:**\n- **Assumption:** Both \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\) are applied before division.\n- **Potential Issue:** But, if \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\) are defined operations, their precedence might not align with standard order. This could lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, assuming standard order might not be correct because \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\) are specific operations defined by the problem, not necessarily following PEMDAS rules.\n\n**Conclusion:** This approach seems flawed because it oversimplifies the role of \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\). I need to reconsider and perhaps look at setting up equations to determine the operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Switching to Strategy 2: Set Up Equations for \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Need:** Define what \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\) represent.\n- **Action:** Create an equation based on the given condition to solve for \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\).\n\n**Step 1:** **Assign Operations to \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\):**\n\nLet\u2019s assume:\n- \\(\\star\\) can be \\(+, -, \\times, \\div\\)\n- \\(*\\) can be \\(+, -, \\times, \\div\\)\n\n**Step 2:** **Set Up the Given Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\star 2}{9 * 3} = 2\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\\[\n12 \\star 2 = 2 \\times (9 * 3)\n\\]\n\n**Wait\u2026 Reflection:**\n- **Realization:** I need to evaluate both sides carefully. Perhaps it's better to consider each operation separately.\n\n**Step 3:** **Consider Possible Operations:**\n\nLet\u2019s brainstorm possible operations for \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\):\n\n- If \\(\\star = +\\) and \\(* = +\\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{12 + 2}{9 + 3} = \\frac{14}{12} \\neq 2\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:** Adding both numerator and denominator doesn't satisfy the equation.\n\n- **Trying Multiplication:**\n  - \\(\\star = \\times\\), \\(* = \\times\\):\n    \\[\n    \\frac{12 \\times 2}{9 \\times 3} = \\frac{24}{27} \\neq 2\n    \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Multiplying both doesn't work either.\n\n- **Consider Division:**\n  - \\(\\star = \\div\\), \\(* = \\div\\):\n    \\[\n    \\frac{12 \\div 2}{9 \\div 3} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2\n    \\]\n\n- **Aha Moment:** Division works! But let's double-check if both operations can be divisions.\n\n**Step 4:** **Confirm Validity:**\n\nIf both \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\) are divisions, the equation holds:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\div 2}{9 \\div 3} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This makes sense. Both operations as divisions satisfy the equation.\n\n**Conclusion:** \\(\\star = \\div\\) and \\(* = \\div\\) is a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Strategy: Applying the Identified Operations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Now:** Use \\(\\star = \\div\\) and \\(* = \\div\\) to solve the second expression.\n- **Action:** Substitute these operations into \\(\\frac{7 \\star 3}{12 * 6}\\).\n\n**Step 1:** **Substitute Operations:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7 \\star 3}{12 * 6} = \\frac{7 \\div 3}{12 \\div 6}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** **Perform the Divisions:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7 \\div 3}{12 \\div 6} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{3}}{\\frac{12}{6}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** **Simplify the Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{7}{3}}{2} = \\frac{7}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), which correctly simplifies the fraction.\n\n**Reflection:** The final answer seems correct. The operations applied consistently align with the original equation's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7 \\star 3}{12 * 6} = \\frac{7}{6}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by considering different strategies\u2014assuming standard order, setting up equations, and testing operation combinations.\n  \n- **Exploring Strategies:** Initially tried applying standard order, which led to confusion, so I switched to assigning operations to \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\).\n\n- **Dead Ends and Adjustments:** Testing simple operations like addition and multiplication didn't satisfy the equation, but division did.\n\n- **Aha Moment:** Realized that both \\(\\star\\) and \\(*\\) need to be divisions to satisfy the given condition.\n\n- **Final Approach:** Applied the identified operations to the second expression, simplifying step-by-step to arrive at the correct fraction.\n\n- **Continuous Checking:** Throughout, I checked if each step made sense, reflecting on whether the operations correctly aligned with the problem's requirements.\n\nThis methodical approach ensured that I arrived at the correct answer while validating each step along the way.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if there's anything specific you'd like me to elaborate on or if there are other questions you have in mind!",

  "ground_truth": "In the equation $\\frac{12\\star2}{9*3}=2$, the numerator of the fraction in the left hand side must be double the denominator. By trial and error, there are two ways to do this. In the first way, the $\\star$ operation is multiplication and the $*$ operation is addition, in which case the equation becomes $\\frac{12\\cdot2}{9+3}=\\frac{24}{12}=2$. Thus, the value of the given expression is $\\frac{7\\cdot3}{12+6}=\\frac{21}{18}=7/6$. In the second way, the $\\star$ operation is division and the $*$ operation is also division, in which case the equation becomes $\\frac{12/2}{9/3}=\\frac{6}{3}=2$. Thus, the value of the given expression is $\\frac{7/3}{12/6}=\\frac{7/3}{2}=7/6$, which is the same as in the first case. In either case, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{6}}$."
