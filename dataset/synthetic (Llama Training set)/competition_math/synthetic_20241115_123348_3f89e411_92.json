    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure to check my work as I go along. It\u2019s important to think out loud, recognize when something isn\u2019t right, and adjust the approach accordingly.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I think it's about minimizing the sum of squared distances from point \\( P \\) to several fixed points \\( A, B, C, D, \\) and \\( E \\) arranged collinearly. \n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**\n  - This looks like a geometric optimization problem.\n  - Maybe using the concept of centroids or geometric means could help?\n  - Alternatively, perhaps applying the method of Lagrange multipliers or considering symmetries might be useful.\n  - I recall that minimizing the sum of squared distances is often related to finding the least squares solution.\n\nBut I'm not sure if those initial thoughts are correct or sufficient. Let's explore and see where it leads.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Using Symmetry and the Geometric Mean:**\n   - Maybe the point \\( P \\) that minimizes the sum of squared distances is the geometric center or centroid of the points.\n   - This would make sense if all segments are equal, but here they aren't.\n\n2. **Applying the Method of Lagrange Multipliers:**\n   - Could use this method to minimize the objective function subject to constraints, but I don't see any constraints other than the given distances.\n   - Wait, that seems a bit overcomplicated for this problem.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Coordinates of Each Point:**\n   - Assigning coordinates based on the given lengths might help in calculating the distances precisely.\n\nI think starting with assigning coordinates makes the most sense. If that leads to complications, I can reconsider the approach.\n\n### **Step 1: Assigning Coordinates**\n\nLet's place the points on a number line for simplicity:\n\n- Let\u2019s set \\( A \\) at \\( 0 \\):\n  \\[\n  A = 0\n  \\]\n- \\( AB = 1 \\), so:\n  \\[\n  B = 1\n  \\]\n- \\( BC = 1 \\), so:\n  \\[\n  C = 2\n  \\]\n- \\( CD = 2 \\), so:\n  \\[\n  D = 4\n  \\]\n- \\( DE = 9 \\), so:\n  \\[\n  E = 13\n  \\]\n\nSo the points are:  \n\\[ A = 0, \\quad B = 1, \\quad C = 2, \\quad D = 4, \\quad E = 13 \\]\n\n### **Reflection on Step 1**\n\nDoes this make sense?  \nYes, assigning coordinates based on the given lengths seems logical. It simplifies calculating the squared distances later.\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing \\( AP^2 + BP^2 + CP^2 + DP^2 + EP^2 \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s express the sum of squared distances from \\( P \\) to each point. I'll denote the position of \\( P \\) as \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nAP^2 = (x - 0)^2 = x^2\n\\]\n\\[\nBP^2 = (x - 1)^2 = (x - 1)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nCP^2 = (x - 2)^2 = (x - 2)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nDP^2 = (x - 4)^2 = (x - 4)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nEP^2 = (x - 13)^2 = (x - 13)^2\n\\]\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\nAP^2 + BP^2 + CP^2 + DP^2 + EP^2 = x^2 + (x - 1)^2 + (x - 2)^2 + (x - 4)^2 + (x - 13)^2\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection on Step 2**\n\nDoes this look correct?  \nYes, expressing each squared distance in terms of \\( x \\) is a good start. It allows us to combine and simplify the expression to find the minimum value.\n\n### **Step 3: Expanding the Expression**\n\nLet\u2019s expand each term:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 13)^2 = x^2 - 26x + 169\n\\]\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + (x^2 - 2x + 1) + (x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 8x + 16) + (x^2 - 26x + 169)\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + x^2 + x^2 + x^2 + x^2 \\quad \\text{(five \\( x^2 \\) terms)}\n\\]\n\\[\n-2x - 4x - 8x - 26x \\quad \\text{(combine the \\( x \\) terms)}\n\\]\n\\[\n1 + 4 + 16 + 169 \\quad \\text{(the constant terms)}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n5x^2 - 40x + 190\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection on Step 3**\n\nIs the expansion correct?  \nLet's quickly check:\n\n- Original terms: \\( x^2 + (x - 1)^2 + (x - 2)^2 + (x - 4)^2 + (x - 13)^2 \\)\n- Expanded and combined: \\( 5x^2 - 40x + 190 \\)\n\nThis seems correct. The coefficients are properly summed.\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Minimum Value**\n\nNow, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes the quadratic expression \\( 5x^2 - 40x + 190 \\).\n\n**Method 1: Completing the Square**\n\nLet\u2019s complete the square:\n\n\\[\n5(x^2 - 8x) + 190\n\\]\n\nTo complete the square inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x \\quad \\text{take half of \\(-8\\), which is \\(-4\\), and square it:}\n\\]\n\\[\n(-4)^2 = 16\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x = (x - 4)^2 - 16\n\\]\n\nBut, multiply by 5:\n\n\\[\n5((x - 4)^2 - 16) = 5(x - 4)^2 - 80\n\\]\n\nAdding the constant term:\n\n\\[\n5(x - 4)^2 - 80 + 190 = 5(x - 4)^2 + 110\n\\]\n\n**Reflection on Completing the Square:**\n\nWait, is this the right approach?  \nYes, completing the square is a standard method to find the minimum value of a quadratic expression. By rewriting it in this form, it's clear that the minimum occurs when \\( (x - 4)^2 = 0 \\), i.e., \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n**Method 2: Using the Vertex Formula**\n\nAlternatively, recall that for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), the vertex (and hence the minimum or maximum point) occurs at:\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{2a}\n\\]\n\nFor our equation \\( 5x^2 - 40x + 190 \\):\n\n\\[\na = 5, \\quad b = -40\n\\]\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{-40}{2 \\times 5} = \\frac{40}{10} = 4\n\\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that the minimum occurs at \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Minimum Value**\n\nNow, let's substitute \\( x = 4 \\) back into the expression to find the minimum value:\n\n\\[\n5(4)^2 - 40(4) + 190\n\\]\n\\[\n= 5(16) - 160 + 190\n\\]\n\\[\n= 80 - 160 + 190\n\\]\n\\[\n= 110\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection on Step 5**\n\nDoes the minimum value make sense?  \nYes, the calculations seem correct. The minimum sum of squared distances is \\( 110 \\) when \\( P \\) is at \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet\u2019s double-check everything to ensure there are no mistakes:\n\n- **Expansion Correctness:**  \n  \\( x^2 + (x - 1)^2 + (x - 2)^2 + (x - 4)^2 + (x - 13)^2 \\) expanded to \\( 5x^2 - 40x + 190 \\).  \n  **Reflection:** Seems correct. No errors in combining like terms.\n\n- **Minimum Calculation:**  \n  Completing the square and using the vertex formula both lead to \\( x = 4 \\).  \n  **Reflection:** Consistency between methods confirms correctness.\n\n- **Final Value:**  \n  Substituting \\( x = 4 \\) yields the minimum sum as \\( 110 \\).  \n  **Reflection:** Calculation checks out.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and carefully checking each step, the smallest possible value of \\( AP^2 + BP^2 + CP^2 + DP^2 + EP^2 \\) is **\\( 110 \\)** when point \\( P \\) is located at \\( x = 4 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let the altitude from $P$ onto $AE$ at $Q$ have lengths $PQ = h$ and $AQ = r$. It is clear that, for a given $r$ value, $AP$, $BP$, $CP$, $DP$, and $EP$ are all minimized when $h = 0$. So $P$ is on $AE$, and therefore, $P = Q$. Thus, $AP$=r, $BP = |r - 1|$, $CP = |r - 2|$, $DP = |r - 4|$, and $EP = |r - 13|.$ Squaring each of these gives:\n$AP^2 + BP^2 + CP^2 + DP^2 + EP^2 = r^2 + (r - 1)^2 + (r - 2)^2 + (r - 4)^2 + (r - 13)^2 = 5r^2 - 40r + 190$\nThis reaches its minimum at $r = \\frac {40}{2\\cdot 5} = 4$, at which point the sum of the squares of the distances is $\\boxed{110}$."
