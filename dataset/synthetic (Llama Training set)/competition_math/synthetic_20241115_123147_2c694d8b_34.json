    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The goal is to compute \n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{xy + yz + zx}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\ngiven that \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are distinct real numbers that sum to \\(0\\). \n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Symmetry in the Variables:** The expression involves symmetric sums of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\)\u2014specifically, the sum of products and the sum of squares. This reminds me of problems involving symmetric polynomials or perhaps factoring techniques.\n\n2. **Condition \\(x + y + z = 0\\):**  This is significant because it relates all three variables. It might help simplify the expression or allow me to substitute one variable in terms of the others.\n\n3. **Possible Use of Substitution:** Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others, simplifying the fraction.\n\n4. **Exploring Numerical Examples:** To get a feel for the problem, it might be helpful to plug in some actual numbers that satisfy the condition and see if a pattern emerges.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Symmetric Polynomial Identity Approach:**\n   - Use known identities for symmetric polynomials to simplify the expression.\n\n2. **Substitution Method:**\n   - Express one variable in terms of the others using \\(x + y + z = 0\\), then substitute into the expression.\n\n3. **Factoring the Numerator and Denominator:**\n   - Check if the fraction can be simplified by factoring common terms.\n\n4. **Numerical Example Verification:**\n   - Pick specific values for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) to see if the general approach works.\n\nLet's start with the **Symmetric Polynomial Identity Approach** because it seems straightforward given the symmetry in the problem. If that doesn't work out, I'll explore the other options.\n\n### **Step 1: Using Symmetric Polynomial Identities**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI know that for three variables, symmetric polynomials have specific relationships. The sum of the variables is zero, which might help in simplifying the expression involving products.\n\n**Symmetric Polynomials:**\n\n- \\(x + y + z = 0\\) (Given)\n- The product \\(xyz\\) doesn't directly appear in the expression but might be related.\n\nLet's recall that for three variables, the following identity holds:\n\n\\[\n(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x + y + z = 0\\), squaring both sides gives:\n\n\\[\n0 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging the Equation:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = -2(xy + yz + zx)\n\\]\n\n**Expressing \\(xy + yz + zx\\):**\n\n\\[\nxy + yz + zx = -\\dfrac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Check:**\n\nThis seems promising because it directly relates \\(xy + yz + zx\\) to \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\). Let's see how this helps in simplifying the original expression.\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting into the Original Expression**\n\n**Expression to Simplify:**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{xy + yz + zx}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\n**Substituting \\(xy + yz + zx\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{-\\dfrac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{2}}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{-\\dfrac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= -\\dfrac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Is it really possible that the answer is always \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) regardless of the distinct real numbers \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) as long as they sum to zero? Let's verify this by considering a specific example.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with a Numerical Example**\n\n**Choosing Specific Values:**\n\nLet\u2019s pick \\(x = 1\\), \\(y = 2\\), and \\(z = -3\\). These are distinct and their sum is \\(0\\):\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 + (-3) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the Numerator:**\n\n\\[\nxy + yz + zx = (1)(2) + (2)(-3) + (-3)(1) = 2 - 6 - 3 = -7\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the Denominator:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + (-3)^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14\n\\]\n\n**Computing the Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{-7}{14} = -\\dfrac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation. The value simplifies to \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), which aligns with the general approach using symmetric polynomials.\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Another Approach\u2014Substitution Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEven though the symmetric polynomial approach worked, let's see if substituting one variable in terms of the others might provide a different perspective or simplify the problem further.\n\n**Using the Condition \\(x + y + z = 0\\):**\n\nLet's solve for \\(z\\):\n\n\\[\nz = -x - y\n\\]\n\n**Substituting \\(z\\) into the Expression:**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{xy + y(-x - y) + (-x - y)x}{x^2 + y^2 + (-x - y)^2}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Numerator:**\n\n\\[\nxy - xy - y^2 - x^2 - xy = -x^2 - y^2 - xy\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Denominator:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + (-x - y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (x^2 + 2xy + y^2) = 2x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2 = 2(x^2 + xy + y^2)\n\\]\n\n**Expression Now:**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{-x^2 - y^2 - xy}{2(x^2 + xy + y^2)}\n\\]\n\n**Factor Out \\(-1\\):**\n\n\\[\n= -\\dfrac{x^2 + y^2 + xy}{2(x^2 + xy + y^2)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis doesn't simplify to \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) directly, but it still maintains a negative half ratio. This suggests that while the substitution method provides a different form, it aligns with the symmetric polynomial approach in essence.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's verify if the general expression derived holds true regardless of the specific values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) as long as they sum to zero.\n\n**Re-examining the Symmetric Polynomial Identity:**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = -2(xy + yz + zx)\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nxy + yz + zx = -\\dfrac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging this into the original expression:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{-\\dfrac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{2}}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = -\\dfrac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe value simplifies consistently to \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), supporting that the answer is indeed \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) for any distinct real numbers \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) that sum to zero.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nInitially, the straightforward nature of arriving at \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) through symmetric polynomials made me double-check the approach. However, verifying with a specific numerical example confirmed the validity. Exploring another method\u2014substituting one variable in terms of the others\u2014provided an alternative perspective but ultimately aligned with the first approach. This consistency across different strategies reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\nBy brainstorming various strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying through examples, I ensured a thorough and accurate solution to the problem.",
