    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's tackle the problem by embracing the brainstorming and reflective thinking process, just like how I would naturally approach it as a human. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at the question, **\"Find the square root of \\(\\dfrac{8!}{70}\\)\"**, my initial reaction is:\n\n- **Recalling Factorials**: I remember that \\(n!\\) stands for the product of all positive integers up to \\(n\\). So, \\(8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times \\dots \\times 1\\). \n- **Feeling Overwhelmed by Large Numbers**: Factorials grow quickly, and dividing by 70 might simplify things, but I'm not entirely sure how.\n- **Square Root Concern**: Taking the square root of such a large fraction seems tricky. I wonder if there\u2019s a way to simplify it before finding the square root.\n\nTo start, I think I need to break down \\(8!\\) and see how it relates to 70. Maybe simplification will help me find the square root more easily.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation Approach**:\n   - Calculate \\(8!\\) directly, divide by 70, and then find the square root.\n   - **Pros**: Straightforward, numerical result.\n   - **Cons**: \\(8!\\) is large (40320), and handling such big numbers might lead to calculation errors.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization Method**:\n   - Factor both 8! and 70 into their prime components to simplify before division.\n   - **Pros**: Might simplify the fraction significantly, making the square root easier to compute.\n   - **Cons**: Time-consuming and requires careful tracking of prime factors.\n\n3. **Simplification Approach**:\n   - Cancel common factors between the numerator (\\(8!\\)) and denominator (70) to simplify the fraction before taking the square root.\n   - **Pros**: Reduces the fraction size, making the square root more manageable.\n   - **Cons**: Need to identify and cancel factors correctly.\n\nHmm, the **Simplification Approach** seems promising because reducing the fraction size before finding the square root could save time and reduce errors. But I\u2019ll keep the Prime Factorization Method in mind as a backup if simplification doesn\u2019t work out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Simplification Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s start by simplifying \\(\\dfrac{8!}{70}\\).\n\n- **Breaking Down \\(8!\\)**:\n  \\[\n  8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\n  \\]\n  \n  But instead of multiplying all the way, let\u2019s see if I can factorize it:\n\n  \\[\n  8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times (6 \\times 5) \\times (4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)\n  \\]\n  \n  I remember:\n  - \\(8 = 2 \\times 4\\)\n  - \\(6 = 2 \\times 3\\)\n  - \\(4 = 2^2\\)\n  \n  So, grouping them:\n  \\[\n  8! = (2 \\times 4) \\times 7 \\times (2 \\times 3) \\times (2^2 \\times 3 \\times 1) = 2^7 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7\n  \\]\n  \n  **Thought Process Check**: Wait, am I sure about this factorization? Let me recount the powers of primes.\n\n  - \\(2^7\\): Correct (four 2s from \\(8\\), two from \\(6\\), one each from \\(4\\) and \\(2\\))\n  - \\(3^2\\): Correct (one from \\(6\\) and one from \\(3\\))\n  - \\(5^1\\): Correct\n  - \\(7^1\\): Correct\n\n  Seems accurate. But is this too complicated? Maybe I should just look for common factors with 70 instead.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Factorizing the Denominator (70)**\n\nLet\u2019s factor 70:\n\n\\[\n70 = 7 \\times 10 = 7 \\times 2 \\times 5\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process Check**: Okay, I see that 70 has 7, 2, and 5 as its prime factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Canceling Common Factors**\n\nNow, let\u2019s see if we can cancel common factors between the numerator (\\(8!\\)) and the denominator (70):\n\n\\[\n8! = 2^7 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7\n\\]\n\\[\n70 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n**Cancelling Common Factors**:\n\n- **2s**: \\(2^7\\) in the numerator and \\(2^1\\) in the denominator \u2192 Remaining \\(2^{6}\\)\n- **5s**: \\(5^1\\) in both numerator and denominator \u2192 Cancel out\n- **7s**: \\(7^1\\) in both numerator and denominator \u2192 Cancel out\n\nSo, after canceling:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{8!}{70} = \\dfrac{2^{6} \\times 3^{2}}{1} = 2^{6} \\times 3^{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Hold on, that seems too neat. Did I really manage to cancel everything except the powers of 2 and 3? Let me verify:\n\n- \\(7\\) and \\(5\\) are both cancelled out.\n- Only \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) remain.\n\nI think this simplification is correct. The fraction reduces nicely.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Simplified Expression**\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{8!}{70} = 2^{6} \\times 3^{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process Check**: This looks much simpler! I can handle finding the square root of \\(2^{6} \\times 3^{2}\\) without much trouble.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Square Root**\n\nLet\u2019s find the square root of the simplified expression:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^{6} \\times 3^{2}} = \\sqrt{2^{6}} \\times \\sqrt{3^{2}} = 2^{3} \\times 3^{1} = 8 \\times 3 = 24\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Wait, does \\(24\\) make sense? Let me quickly check:\n\n- \\(2^{3} = 8\\)\n- \\(3^{1} = 3\\)\n- \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\)\n\nYes, that seems correct. The calculations are straightforward after simplification.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Result**\n\nLet me double-check if all steps are accurate:\n\n1. **Factorization of \\(8!\\)**: Correctly identified prime factors and their powers.\n2. **Cancellation with 70**: Ensured all common factors were cancelled.\n3. **Square Root Calculation**: Successfully computed the square root of the simplified expression.\n\nEverything looks good! The final answer is **24**.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Prime Factorization Method**\n\nAs a backup, let me briefly sketch how the Prime Factorization Method would work:\n\n- **Factor \\(8!\\)**:\n  \\[\n  8! = 2^{7} \\times 3^{2} \\times 5 \\times 7\n  \\]\n  \n- **Factor 70**:\n  \\[\n  70 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 7\n  \\]\n  \n- **Divide**:\n  \\[\n  \\dfrac{8!}{70} = \\dfrac{2^{7} \\times 3^{2} \\times 5 \\times 7}{2 \\times 5 \\times 7} = 2^{6} \\times 3^{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Square Root**:\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{2^{6} \\times 3^{2}} = 24\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection**: This alternative approach also leads to the same result. It's always good to have multiple methods confirming the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy initially brainstorming different strategies and choosing to simplify the fraction step by step, I was able to arrive at the correct answer\u2014**24**\u2014efficiently. Throughout the process, reflecting and double-checking each step ensured accuracy, preventing potential mistakes that could arise from directly calculating large factorials. Embracing this human-like thinking, including exploring, checking, and adjusting strategies, was key to solving the problem correctly.",
