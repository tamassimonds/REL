    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see that it's about a convex pentagon \\(ABCDE\\) with specific side lengths. The pentagon is rolled clockwise along the \\(x\\)-axis, starting from vertex \\(A\\) at the origin and vertex \\(B\\) on the positive \\(x\\)-axis. The goal is to determine which side of the pentagon touches the point \\(x = 2009\\) on the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\nHonestly, my initial reaction is that this involves some geometric reasoning about rolling shapes along a line. It reminds me of problems where you track the movement of polygons along certain paths. But I'm not entirely sure where to start.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Mapping the Pentagon's Movement:**\n   - I could try to map out how each side of the pentagon moves as it rolls along the \\(x\\)-axis.\n   - This might involve figuring out the angles between sides and how they relate to the rolling motion.\n\n2. **Calculating the Total Distance Covered:**\n   - Another approach could be to calculate the cumulative distance covered by the pentagon's sides as it rolls.\n   - This would help in pinpointing which side aligns with \\(x = 2009\\).\n\n3. **Using Rotation and Translation Vectors:**\n   - Perhaps using vectors to represent each side's movement could simplify tracking the pentagon's position.\n   - This might be a more mathematical approach but could provide accuracy.\n\n4. **Visualizing with Diagrams:**\n   - Drawing a diagram to visualize the rolling process might help in understanding which side touches the designated point.\n\nReflecting on these, I think combining mapping the pentagon's movement with some calculations about the distances covered makes the most sense. Let me start with that and see where it leads.\n\n### **Step 1: Mapping the Pentagon's Movement**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to understand how the pentagon rolls along the \\(x\\)-axis. Each side will touch the ground in sequence as it rolls. The question is, by the time the pentagon reaches \\(x = 2009\\), which side is in contact with the \\(x\\)-axis?\n\n**Approach:**\nLet's assume the pentagon starts rolling from vertex \\(B\\) along the \\(x\\)-axis. I'll map out the sequence of sides touching the ground.\n\n- **First Contact:** Side \\(AB\\)\n- **Second Contact:** Side \\(BC\\)\n- **Third Contact:** Side \\(CD\\)\n- **Fourth Contact:** Side \\(DE\\)\n- **Fifth Contact:** Side \\(EA\\)\n\nWait, that seems off because the pentagon needs to roll fully to switch sides. Maybe I need to consider the angles between the sides and how they affect the rolling sequence.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI'm realizing that simply listing the sides might not be enough. The pentagon doesn't just switch sides sequentially; the angle of rotation between sides plays a significant role. I need to incorporate the angles to accurately map the movement.\n\n### **Step 2: Incorporating Angles and Side Lengths**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo determine which side touches \\(x = 2009\\), I need to calculate the total distance the pentagon rolls and how each side contributes to this movement.\n\n**Approach:**\n- **Rolling Distance per Side:** When a side rolls, the pentagon rotates around the previous side's endpoint. The rolling distance is related to the side length and the angle of rotation.\n\n**Calculations:**\nLet's assign the length of each side:\n\n- \\(AB = 3\\)\n- \\(BC = 4\\)\n- \\(CD = 6\\)\n- \\(DE = 3\\)\n- \\(EA = 7\\)\n\nNow, I recall that the angle between adjacent sides affects the rolling distance. However, the angles aren't provided directly in the problem. This might complicate things.\n\n**Reflection:**\nWithout knowing the angles, it's challenging to calculate the exact rolling distance. Maybe there's another way to approach this that doesn't require precise angle measurements.\n\n***Alternative Brainstorming:***\n\nAh, perhaps I can leverage the fact that the point \\(x = 2009\\) is quite far along the \\(x\\)-axis. This suggests that multiple rotations have occurred. It might be more about identifying the position after several rolls rather than calculating each individual step.\n\nLet me reconsider my approach based on this insight.\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Cumulative Rolling Distances**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nInstead of calculating each side's individual contribution, perhaps I can determine the cumulative distance covered by the pentagon until it reaches \\(x = 2009\\).\n\n**Approach:**\n- Assume each side contributes to the rolling distance based on its length and the angle it makes with the ground.\n- Since \\(x = 2009\\) is far, it's likely that multiple sides have successively rolled over this distance.\n\n**Calculations:**\nI'm thinking that if the pentagon has rolled over \\(x = 2009\\), then the cumulative distance covered by all sides must equal or exceed \\(2009\\).\n\nBut wait, calculating this directly seems cumbersome without precise angle information.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis doesn't seem like the most efficient path. Maybe there's a simpler way to determine which side is in contact without calculating the total rolling distance.\n\n***Alternative Idea:***\n\nPerhaps instead of tracking the cumulative distance, I can analyze the sequence and symmetry of the pentagon's sides to predict which side aligns with \\(x = 2009\\).\n\nLet me explore this idea further.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyzing the Sequence of Sides**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe pentagon rolls in a sequence based on its sides' lengths. To determine which side touches \\(x = 2009\\), I can analyze the order and see how far each side extends along the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Start rolling from \\(B\\) and move sequentially through the sides.\n- Calculate the maximum \\(x\\)-coordinate each side reaches.\n\n**Calculations:**\nBut again, without angles, calculating precise \\(x\\)-coordinates is tricky.\n\n**Reflection:**\nRealizing that without angle measurements, this approach is becoming impractical, I need to think of another strategy.\n\n***Alternative Brainstorming:***\n\nMaybe I can use the concept of periodicity in the rolling motion. If the pentagon has a repeating pattern in its rolling, I can determine which side touches at specific \\(x\\)-values based on this pattern.\n\nLet me proceed with this idea.\n\n### **Step 5: Exploring Periodicity in Rolling**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWhen the pentagon rolls, each side has a specific angle relative to the ground. If the rolling motion is periodic, I can determine which side touches \\(x = 2009\\) by finding the equivalent position within one full cycle.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Determine the total rolling distance in one full cycle (sum of all sides' lengths).\n- Use the modulo operation to find the position within this cycle at \\(x = 2009\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\nLet\u2019s calculate the total rolling distance in one cycle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total rolling distance} = AB + BC + CD + DE + EA = 3 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 23\n\\]\n\nNow, find the position within this cycle at \\(x = 2009\\):\n\n\\[\n2009 \\mod 23 = ?\n\\]\n\nWait, let me perform the modulo operation:\n\n\\[\n2009 \\div 23 \\approx 87 \\quad (\\text{since } 23 \\times 87 = 2001)\n\\]\n\\[\n2009 - 2001 = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(2009 \\mod 23 = 8\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis means that at \\(x = 2009\\), the pentagon is at position \\(8\\) within its rolling cycle. Now, I need to determine which side corresponds to this position.\n\n### **Step 6: Determining the Corresponding Side**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWith the modulo result indicating position \\(8\\) within the rolling cycle, I can map this position to the sides of the pentagon based on their lengths and order.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Sequentially add the lengths of each side to determine the cumulative position within the cycle.\n- Identify which side corresponds to the position \\(8\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\nLet\u2019s add the side lengths sequentially:\n\n1. **Side \\(AB\\) (Length \\(3\\)):**\n   - Starts at \\(x = 0\\), ends at \\(x = 3\\).\n\n2. **Side \\(BC\\) (Length \\(4\\)):**\n   - Starts at \\(x = 3\\), ends at \\(x = 7\\).\n\n3. **Side \\(CD\\) (Length \\(6\\)):**\n   - Starts at \\(x = 7\\), ends at \\(x = 13\\).\n\nAh, I see that at \\(x = 8\\), the pentagon is on side \\(CD\\), which has a length of \\(6\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis makes sense because the position \\(8\\) falls within the range of side \\(CD\\) (from \\(x = 7\\) to \\(x = 13\\)). Therefore, the side touching \\(x = 2009\\) is \\(CD\\).\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing the answer, let me briefly verify the steps to ensure the correctness.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Confirm the total rolling distance calculation.\n- Check that the modulo operation was performed correctly.\n- Ensure that the side lengths are accurately mapped to the rolling positions.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe calculations seem consistent. The total rolling distance is \\(23\\), and the modulo result aligns with the position \\(8\\) being on side \\(CD\\). Everything checks out.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the calculations, the side that touches the point \\(x = 2009\\) on the \\(x\\)-axis is **CD**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:** **CD**\n\nI've walked through various approaches, checked my work at each stage, and adjusted my strategy as needed. By leveraging the concept of periodicity in the pentagon's rolling motion and carefully mapping the cumulative distances, I arrived at the correct solution.",
