The question is about finding the distance between two points on the complex plane: Matt\u2019s point \\(1 - 4i\\) and Marie\u2019s point \\(-4 + 2i\\). \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Recalling Strategies:** This reminds me of finding distances between points in a coordinate system, like using the Pythagorean theorem in a Cartesian plane.\n- **Complex Numbers Familiarity:** I remember that the distance in the complex plane is akin to the magnitude of the difference between the two numbers.\n- **Exploring Methods:** Maybe I could:\n  - Subtract the two points and find the magnitude of the result.\n  - Use the formula for distance in terms of real and imaginary parts.\n  - Visualize it as vectors and think about their lengths.\n\nBut honestly, I\u2019m not entirely sure which method is the best to start with. Let's explore them one by one.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Subtract and Find the Magnitude**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Subtract Marie\u2019s point from Matt\u2019s point to find the vector connecting them.\n- Then, find the magnitude of this vector to get the distance.\n\n**Step-by-Step:**\n\n1. **Subtract the Points:**\n   \\[\n   (1 - 4i) - (-4 + 2i) = 1 - 4i + 4 - 2i = (1 + 4) + (-4 - 2)i = 5 - 6i\n   \\]\n2. **Find the Magnitude:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Magnitude} = \\sqrt{(5)^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 36} = \\sqrt{61}\n   \\]\n   \n**Quick Check:** \n- Wait, \\(\\sqrt{61}\\) is around 7.81, which seems reasonable. But let me double-check the subtraction to ensure it\u2019s correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The subtraction looks accurate. Adding real parts and imaginary parts separately makes sense.\n- I\u2019m feeling confident about this approach but let's verify using another method to be sure.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Use the Distance Formula for Complex Numbers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- There's a standard formula for the distance between two complex numbers: \n  \\[\n  d = |z_1 - z_2|\n  \\]\n- This seems similar to the first strategy but more formalized.\n\n**Step-by-Step:**\n\n1. **Identify the Points:**\n   \\[\n   z_1 = 1 - 4i, \\quad z_2 = -4 + 2i\n   \\]\n2. **Subtract the Points:**\n   \\[\n   z_1 - z_2 = (1 - 4i) - (-4 + 2i) = 5 - 6i\n   \\]\n3. **Find the Magnitude:**\n   \\[\n   |5 - 6i| = \\sqrt{5^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 36} = \\sqrt{61}\n   \\]\n   \n**Quick Check:**\n- Same result as before: \\(\\sqrt{61} \\approx 7.81\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This method aligns perfectly with the first one. It reinforces the correctness of the answer.\n- Having two different approaches yielding the same result increases confidence.\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Visualizing on the Complex Plane**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Maybe visualizing the points and the distance as vectors could provide additional intuition.\n- However, without a graph right now, it's hard to rely solely on this method.\n\n**Step:**\n- Matt\u2019s point \\(1 - 4i\\) is at (1, -4) in the Cartesian plane.\n- Marie\u2019s point \\(-4 + 2i\\) is at (-4, 2).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The vector connecting the two points is \\((1 - (-4), -4 - 2) = (5, -6)\\).\n- But without calculating the magnitude explicitly, this method feels less direct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- While it\u2019s helpful to think about the problem visually, the numerical methods are more straightforward for accuracy.\n\n### Final Check\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Both numerical strategies led to the same magnitude: \\(\\sqrt{61}\\).\n- This makes sense given the calculations.\n- Let\u2019s quickly verify the subtraction step to ensure no calculation errors.\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n- **Subtraction Check:**\n  \\[\n  (1 - 4i) - (-4 + 2i) = 5 - 6i \\quad \\text{(Confirmed)}\n  \\]\n- **Magnitude Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{25 + 36} = \\sqrt{61} \\quad \\text{(Confirmed)}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Everything checks out. The answer makes sense both numerically and conceptually.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe distance between Matt and Marie's points is \\(\\sqrt{61}\\), which is approximately **7.81**.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- Exploring multiple strategies helped confirm the correctness of the result.\n- Reflecting and verifying each step ensured accuracy.\n- While visual methods can aid understanding, numerical approaches provided a direct solution here.\n- Always checking work along the way is crucial to catch any potential errors early.",
