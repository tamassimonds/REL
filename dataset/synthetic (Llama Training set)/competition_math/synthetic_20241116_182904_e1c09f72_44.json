    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, just like I would if I were tackling it in real life. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see that it's about prime numbers and their cumulative sums. Specifically, we're adding prime numbers in order, starting with 2, and looking at the first 12 such sums to see how many of them are also prime.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- **Prime Numbers:** Okay, I remember that prime numbers are those greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n- **Cumulative Sums:** We're adding these primes one by one. This reminds me of creating a running total or sequence.\n- **Checking for Primality:** After each sum, I need to check if the result is prime.\n\nI'm thinking this involves both calculating the sums and verifying their primality. At first glance, it seems straightforward, but keeping track of primes and ensuring accuracy will be important.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: List and Sum Primes, Then Check for Primality**\n\n1. **List the First N Primes:** Start with the smallest primes.\n2. **Calculate Cumulative Sums:** Add them sequentially.\n3. **Check Each Sum for Primality:** Determine if each cumulative sum is prime.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems like a direct approach. However, I realize I need to be careful with primality checks, especially as sums grow larger. Also, I'm not sure if listing primes up to a certain point will cover the first 12 sums since we're adding them cumulatively.\n\n**Strategy 2: Use a Primality Test for Each Sum**\n\n1. **Perform Cumulative Addition.**\n2. **Apply a Primality Test After Each Addition.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUsing a primality test after each sum could be efficient. But I need to ensure the test is accurate and quick, particularly for larger sums.\n\n**Strategy 3: Consider Patterns in Primes and Their Sums**\n\n1. **Look for Patterns:** Perhaps not all sums will be prime.\n2. **Determine If There's a Pattern or Rule.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nMaybe there's a pattern where only certain sums are prime, similar to the distribution of primes themselves. This might help reduce the number of checks needed.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI'm leaning towards **Strategy 1**\u2014listing the primes, calculating cumulative sums, and checking each sum for primality. It feels straightforward, though I'll need to be meticulous with the primality checks.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Listing the First Few Primes**\n\nTo begin, I need to list the prime numbers starting from 2. Let\u2019s recall the prime numbers:\n\n- **First Few Primes:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37...\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need primes to calculate the first 12 cumulative sums. Since prime numbers become less frequent as they get larger, I might list more than 12 primes initially to ensure I have enough for the sums.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIs 12 enough? Let's see how the cumulative sums progress. If they exceed 12, I might need to adjust.\n\n**Check:**\n\nThe first few primes should suffice, but I'll keep an eye on the sums to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Cumulative Sums**\n\nNow, I'll calculate the cumulative sums of these primes, one by one.\n\n1. **First Sum:**  \n   \\(2\\)  \n   - **Cumulative Sum:** \\(2\\)  \n   - **Check:** Is \\(2\\) prime? Yes.\n\n2. **Second Sum:**  \n   \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)  \n   - **Cumulative Sum:** \\(5\\)  \n   - **Check:** Is \\(5\\) prime? Yes.\n\n3. **Third Sum:**  \n   \\(2 + 3 + 5 = 10\\)  \n   - **Cumulative Sum:** \\(10\\)  \n   - **Check:** Is \\(10\\) prime? No. (Divisible by 2)\n\n4. **Fourth Sum:**  \n   \\(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17\\)  \n   - **Cumulative Sum:** \\(17\\)  \n   - **Check:** Is \\(17\\) prime? Yes.\n\n5. **Fifth Sum:**  \n   \\(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 28\\)  \n   - **Cumulative Sum:** \\(28\\)  \n   - **Check:** Is \\(28\\) prime? No. (Divisible by 2)\n\n6. **Sixth Sum:**  \n   \\(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 41\\)  \n   - **Cumulative Sum:** \\(41\\)  \n   - **Check:** Is \\(41\\) prime? Yes.\n\n7. **Seventh Sum:**  \n   \\(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 = 58\\)  \n   - **Cumulative Sum:** \\(58\\)  \n   - **Check:** Is \\(58\\) prime? No. (Divisible by 2)\n\n8. **Eighth Sum:**  \n   \\(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 = 77\\)  \n   - **Cumulative Sum:** \\(77\\)  \n   - **Check:** Is \\(77\\) prime? No. (Divisible by 7)\n\n9. **Ninth Sum:**  \n   \\(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 = 100\\)  \n   - **Cumulative Sum:** \\(100\\)  \n   - **Check:** Is \\(100\\) prime? No. (Divisible by 2)\n\n10. **Tenth Sum:**  \n    \\(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 = 129\\)  \n    - **Cumulative Sum:** \\(129\\)  \n    - **Check:** Is \\(129\\) prime? No. (Divisible by 3)\n\n11. **Eleventh Sum:**  \n    \\(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 = 160\\)  \n    - **Cumulative Sum:** \\(160\\)  \n    - **Check:** Is \\(160\\) prime? No. (Divisible by 2)\n\n12. **Twelfth Sum:**  \n    \\(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 = 197\\)  \n    - **Cumulative Sum:** \\(197\\)  \n    - **Check:** Is \\(197\\) prime? Yes.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI calculated each cumulative sum by adding the next prime to the previous total. After each sum, I checked its primality.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me double-check the sums, especially the larger ones. It's easy to make a mistake with arithmetic.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying Cumulative Sums**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I'll briefly verify the larger sums, starting from the seventh.\n\n1. **Seventh Sum Verification:**  \n   Previous sum:  \n   \\(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 41\\)  \n   Add next prime:  \n   \\(41 + 17 = 58\\)  \n   **Correct:** Yes, matches.\n\n2. **Eighth Sum Verification:**  \n   \\(58 + 19 = 77\\)  \n   **Correct:** Yes, matches.\n\n3. **Ninth Sum Verification:**  \n   \\(77 + 23 = 100\\)  \n   **Correct:** Yes, matches.\n\n4. **Tenth Sum Verification:**  \n   \\(100 + 29 = 129\\)  \n   **Correct:** Yes, matches.\n\n5. **Eleventh Sum Verification:**  \n   \\(129 + 31 = 160\\)  \n   **Correct:** Yes, matches.\n\n6. **Twelfth Sum Verification:**  \n   \\(160 + 37 = 197\\)  \n   **Correct:** Yes, matches.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAll sums verify correctly. This gives me confidence that my calculations are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Counting the Prime Cumulative Sums**\n\nNow, I'll tally how many of these cumulative sums are prime.\n\n**Prime Cumulative Sums:**\n\n1. **First Sum:** \\(2\\)\n2. **Second Sum:** \\(5\\)\n3. **Fourth Sum:** \\(17\\)\n4. **Sixth Sum:** \\(41\\)\n5. **Twelfth Sum:** \\(197\\)\n\n**Total:** 5 prime sums\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI simply counted the sums that are prime.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me quickly check if I missed any primes or if a non-prime sum was incorrectly counted.\n\n**Check:**\n\nRe-examining the sums, I see that only five are prime. This matches the expectation that not all cumulative sums of primes are prime.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Ensuring Correctness and Final Thoughts**\n\nTo wrap up, I'll reflect on the entire process to ensure everything is correct.\n\n**Did the Strategy Work?**\n\nYes, listing the primes, calculating cumulative sums, and checking for primality was effective.\n\n**Mistakes or Adjustments?**\n\nInitially, I considered whether I needed more than 12 primes but concluded that listing the first 12 sufficed for the sums required.\n\n**Alternative Approaches:**\n\nI briefly considered looking for patterns or using advanced primality tests, but the straightforward method was sufficient.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThe approach was straightforward and effective. By carefully verifying each sum and consistently checking for primality, I arrived at the correct answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere are **five** cumulative sums out of the first twelve that are prime.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n5\n\n---\n\nThat's it! By brainstorming different strategies, reflecting and adjusting as needed, and meticulously checking each step, I was able to solve the problem accurately.",
