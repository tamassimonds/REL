I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like a human would.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem asks about the number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) of integers such that \\(|a \\omega + b| = 1\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a nonreal root of \\(z^3 = 1\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Understanding \\(\\omega\\):**  \n   - I remember from previous problems that the roots of \\(z^3 = 1\\) are the cube roots of unity. One of them is real, namely \\(1\\), and the other two are nonreal.\n   - The nonreal roots are usually \\(\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}\\) and \\(\\omega^2 = e^{-2\\pi i/3}\\).\n\n2. **Magnitude Condition:**  \n   - The condition \\(|a \\omega + b| = 1\\) involves complex magnitudes. This reminds me of problems related to circles in the complex plane.\n   - It seems like the expression \\(a \\omega + b\\) represents a point in the complex plane, and we're looking for integer \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that this point lies on the unit circle.\n\n3. **Possible Strategies:**\n   - **Geometric Interpretation:** Visualize the equation geometrically to understand the locus of points.\n   - **Algebraic Approach:** Expand and simplify the equation to find integer solutions.\n   - **Number Theory Insight:** Use properties of magnitudes and integer coefficients to find valid pairs.\n\n4. **Uncertainty:**  \n   - I'm not completely sure which approach will be the most straightforward. The geometric interpretation seems appealing, but it might get messy with complex numbers. The algebraic approach could work by expanding the equation, but I need to check if it leads to integer solutions easily.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Geometric Approach**\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Locus**\n\n- The equation \\(|a \\omega + b| = 1\\) describes a circle of radius 1 centered at \\(-b/\\omega\\) in the complex plane.\n- Since \\(\\omega\\) is a nonreal complex number, \\(-b/\\omega\\) represents a complex center that depends on \\(b\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This approach provides a visual understanding, but finding integer \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that satisfy the equation might be challenging.\n- I realize that dealing with \\(\\omega\\) being complex makes this less straightforward, especially since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Is \\(|a \\omega + b|\\) always an integer? Since \\(\\omega\\) is complex, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, the magnitude could potentially take non-integer values depending on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The geometric approach helps in understanding the problem but may not directly lead to an easy solution for integer pairs \\((a, b)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Shifting to the Algebraic Approach**\n\n**Step 2: Expanding the Magnitude Condition**\n\n- Let's rewrite \\(|a \\omega + b| = 1\\) in terms of real and imaginary parts.\n- Recall that \\(\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\). So, \\(\\omega^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- By substituting \\(\\omega\\) into the equation, we can separate real and imaginary parts to find conditions on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n- This might lead to two equations (one for real part, one for imaginary part) that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must satisfy.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Let\u2019s express \\(a \\omega + b\\):\n  \\[\n  a \\omega + b = a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\right) + b = \\left(-\\frac{a}{2} + b\\right) + \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\n  \\]\n\n- Now, compute the magnitude:\n  \\[\n  |a \\omega + b| = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{a}{2} + b\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{a}{2} + b\\right)^2 + \\frac{3a^2}{4}}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{a}{2} + b\\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}a^2}\n  \\]\n\n- Set this equal to 1:\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{a}{2} + b\\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}a^2} = 1\n  \\]\n  \n- Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n  \\[\n  \\left(-\\frac{a}{2} + b\\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}a^2 = 1\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Now, we have an equation involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that\u2019s easier to work with.\n- The next step would be to solve this equation for integer values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Is this equation always satisfied for integer \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? \n- Wait, let\u2019s see if the equation can be simplified or if specific integer values can be plugged in to find valid pairs.\n\n---\n\n### **Simplifying and Solving the Equation**\n\n**Step 3: Expanding the Equation**\n\n- Let\u2019s expand the equation:\n  \\[\n  \\left(-\\frac{a}{2} + b\\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}a^2 = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\left(\\frac{a}{2} - b\\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}a^2 = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\left(\\frac{a^2}{4} - ab + b^2\\right) + \\frac{3}{4}a^2 = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\left(\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}a^2\\right) - ab + b^2 = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1\n  \\]\n  \n- Wait a moment\u2014this simplification leads to:\n  \\[\n  a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- That looks neat! The equation \\(a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1\\) seems manageable.\n- Now, I can think about possible integer solutions \\((a, b)\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Does this form represent all possible solutions? Given that it's a quadratic in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I should check if all integer solutions are covered.\n- But wait, is it symmetrical? I can swap \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps there are redundancies in counting.\n\n---\n\n### **Finding Integer Solutions**\n\n**Step 4: Enumerating Possible Integer Pairs**\n\n- Given the equation \\(a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1\\), let's look for integer solutions.\n- Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, I can check small values to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Maybe start with \\(b = 0\\), then \\(b = 1\\), and so on, to see corresponding \\(a\\) values.\n- Also, consider negative \\(b\\) values since \\(b\\) can be any integer.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **For \\(b = 0\\):**\n   \\[\n   a^2 = 1 \\implies a = \\pm 1\n   \\]\n   - Solutions: \\((1, 0)\\), \\((-1, 0)\\)\n\n2. **For \\(b = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   a^2 - a + 1 = 1 \\implies a^2 - a = 0 \\implies a(a - 1) = 0 \\implies a = 0 \\text{ or } 1\n   \\]\n   - Solutions: \\((0, 1)\\), \\((1, 1)\\)\n\n3. **For \\(b = -1\\):**\n   \\[\n   a^2 + a + 1 = 1 \\implies a^2 + a = 0 \\implies a(a + 1) = 0 \\implies a = 0 \\text{ or } -1\n   \\]\n   - Solutions: \\((0, -1)\\), \\((-1, -1)\\)\n\n4. **For \\(b = 2\\):**\n   \\[\n   a^2 - 2a + 4 = 1 \\implies a^2 - 2a + 3 = 0\n   \\]\n   - Discriminant: \\(D = (-2)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 3 = 4 - 12 = -8\\)\n   - Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real (and therefore no integer) solutions.\n  \n5. **For \\(b = -2\\):**\n   \\[\n   a^2 + 2a + 4 = 1 \\implies a^2 + 2a + 3 = 0\n   \\]\n   - Discriminant: \\(D = 4 - 12 = -8\\)\n   - No solutions again.\n\n**Observation:**\n\n- The only integer solutions occur when \\(|b| \\leq 1\\).\n- Higher absolute values of \\(b\\) lead to negative discriminants, indicating no integer solutions.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- So far, I have the following solutions: \\((1, 0)\\), \\((-1, 0)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((0, -1)\\), and \\((1, 1)\\), \\((-1, -1)\\).\n- Wait, are there more? Maybe I missed pairs where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both negative but still satisfy the equation.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Let's verify if these are all the solutions or if there's more to explore.\n\n---\n\n### **Verifying and Finalizing the Solutions**\n\n**Step 5: Ensuring All Solutions Are Found**\n\n- I initially listed six pairs: \\((1, 0)\\), \\((-1, 0)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((0, -1)\\), \\((1, 1)\\), and \\((-1, -1)\\).\n- To make sure I've captured all, let's consider the symmetry of the equation.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The equation \\(a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1\\) is symmetric in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). This means if \\((a, b)\\) is a solution, \\((b, a)\\) should also be a solution.\n- However, since I'm looking for ordered pairs, \\((a, b)\\) and \\((b, a)\\) are distinct unless \\(a = b\\), but I already accounted for those.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- I notice that the pairs I listed cover all possible integer combinations where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are within \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\) and satisfy the equation.\n- Given that higher absolute values of \\(b\\) yield no solutions, and the symmetry is considered, I believe these are all the solutions.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- It seems I've covered all possible integer pairs that satisfy the equation.\n- The total number of solutions is \\(6\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) of integers such that \\(|a \\omega + b| = 1\\) is **6**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- Initially, the geometric approach helped me understand the problem's nature, but it wasn't the most practical for finding integer solutions.\n- Switching to the algebraic approach, particularly simplifying the magnitude condition to \\(a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1\\), was effective.\n- By enumerating possible integer pairs and considering the symmetry of the equation, I was able to find all valid solutions.\n- Throughout, reflecting and checking each step ensured accuracy, preventing oversight of potential solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Solution**\n\n- **Equation Derived:**  \n  \\(|a \\omega + b| = 1\\) \u2192 \\(a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1\\)\n\n- **Ordered Pairs Found:**  \n  \\((1, 0)\\), \\((-1, 0)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((0, -1)\\), \\((1, 1)\\), \\((-1, -1)\\)\n\n- **Total Number of Ordered Pairs:**  \n  **6**\n\n---\n\nBy exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the correctness, I arrived at the final solution confidently. This human-like thought process\u2014messy, iterative, and reflective\u2014ultimately led to the accurate count of ordered pairs.",
