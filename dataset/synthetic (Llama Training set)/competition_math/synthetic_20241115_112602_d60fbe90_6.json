    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling it myself, exploring different strategies, reflecting, and checking my work along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** \"This looks like a modular arithmetic problem with integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The conditions involve congruences, which remind me of solving systems of equations modulo some number.\"\n  \n- **Similarity to Past Problems:** \"It somewhat resembles linear congruences I've dealt with before, maybe something like solving for variables under certain conditions.\"\n\n- **Uncertainty:** \"But I'm not entirely sure how to set it up right away. I'm thinking about whether I should manipulate the equations directly or maybe use substitution.\"\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Substitution:**\n   - Try to substitute one equation into another to solve for one variable.\n   - **Pros:** Straightforward approach; might directly give a solution.\n   - **Cons:** Could lead to messy calculations with modular arithmetic.\n\n2. **Elimination Method:**\n   - Similar to solving linear equations; add or subtract equations to eliminate variables.\n   - **Pros:** Familiar method; might simplify the problem.\n   - **Cons:** Need to be careful with modulo operations.\n\n3. **Guess and Check:**\n   - Plug in possible values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to see if both conditions are satisfied.\n   - **Pros:** Simple and intuitive; good for validating other methods.\n   - **Cons:** Time-consuming and doesn't scale well with larger numbers.\n\n4. **Matrix Method (Modular):**\n   - Using matrices to represent the system of equations.\n   - **Pros:** Systematic approach; can handle more complex systems.\n   - **Cons:** Overkill for a simple two-equation system; might complicate things.\n\n### **Choosing a Strategy**\n\nGiven the simplicity of the problem (just two equations) and my familiarity with linear congruences, I'll start with the **Elimination Method**. If this doesn't work out, I'll reassess and consider another approach.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equations**\n\nThe problem gives me two congruences:\n\n1. \\(a + b \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}\\)\n2. \\(2a + b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}\\)\n\n**Thoughts:** \"Okay, these are similar to linear equations. I can try to eliminate one variable by subtracting one equation from the other.\"\n\n### **Step 2: Subtracting the Equations**\n\nLet's subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\[\n(2a + b) - (a + b) \\equiv 1 - 2 \\pmod{10}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n2a + b - a - b \\equiv -1 \\pmod{10}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\na \\equiv -1 \\pmod{10}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \"Wait, does this make sense? \\(-1\\) modulo \\(10\\) is actually \\(9\\), so \\(a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{10}\\). That seems reasonable.\"\n\n### **Step 3: Substituting Back to Find \\(b\\)**\n\nNow that I know \\(a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{10}\\), let's substitute back into the first equation to find \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\n9 + b \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nb \\equiv 2 - 9 \\pmod{10}\n\\]\n\\[\nb \\equiv -7 \\pmod{10}\n\\]\n\\[\nb \\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \"This looks good because \\(-7\\) modulo \\(10\\) is \\(3\\).\"\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore proceeding, let's check if these values satisfy both original equations.\n\n- **Check Equation 1:** \n  \\[\n  9 + 3 \\equiv 12 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10} \\quad \\text{(\u2713)}\n  \\]\n- **Check Equation 2:** \n  \\[\n  2(9) + 3 \\equiv 18 + 3 \\equiv 21 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10} \\quad \\text{(\u2713)}\n  \\]\n\n**Thoughts:** \"Both conditions are satisfied. It seems like the elimination method worked well here.\"\n\n### **Step 5: Finding \\(a - b\\)**\n\nNow, let's calculate \\(a - b\\):\n\n\\[\na - b \\equiv 9 - 3 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \"So, the last digit of \\(a - b\\) is \\(6\\). Let me double-check this.\"\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Rechecking Calculations:**\n  - \\(9 + 3 = 12 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}\\) \u2714\n  - \\(2(9) + 3 = 21 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}\\) \u2714\n  - \\(9 - 3 = 6 \\pmod{10}\\) \u2714\n\n- **Alternative Method Verification:** \"If I had used the guess and check method, I would have plugged in different values to see if both congruences hold. Given that our elimination method worked, it's a good indication that the solution is correct.\"\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and reflecting on each step, the last digit of \\(a - b\\) is **6**. The elimination method helped simplify the system of congruences, leading directly to the solution. Always verifying each part ensured the correctness of the final answer.\n\nWould you like me to explore another method or dive deeper into any specific part?",
