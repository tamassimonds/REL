    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through like a human would. \n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see this expression:\n\n\\[\n(1 + 2x) - 2(1 + 2x + 3x^2) + 3(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3) - 4(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4)\n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is that this looks like a series of polynomial expressions being added and subtracted with increasing coefficients. It reminds me of distributing terms and maybe dealing with combining like terms.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Expand Everything:** Simplify by distributing each term fully.\n2. **Combine Like Terms Early:** Try to group and combine terms with the same power of \\(x\\) as I go.\n3. **Factor Out Common Elements:** Check if there's a common factor at each step that can be factored out to simplify calculations.\n4. **Use Pascal's Triangle (or Binomial Expansion):** Maybe there's a pattern or symmetry I can exploit.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nExpanding everything seems straightforward but could get messy. Factoring out common elements might simplify things. Combining like terms early could help see patterns or mistakes sooner.\n\n### **Step 1: Expanding the First Few Terms**\n\n**Starting with the first expression:**\n\n\\[\n(1 + 2x)\n\\]\n\n- This is simple; there's nothing to distribute here. It's already in its simplest form.\n\n**Moving to the second expression:**\n\n\\[\n-2(1 + 2x + 3x^2)\n\\]\n  \n- Distributing \\(-2\\):\n  \\[\n  -2 \\times 1 = -2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -2 \\times 2x = -4x\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -2 \\times 3x^2 = -6x^2\n  \\]\n  \n  **So, \\( -2(1 + 2x + 3x^2) = -2 - 4x - 6x^2 \\)**\n\n**Reflection Check:**  \nMultiplying each term individually seems correct. No issues here.\n\n### **Step 2: Expanding the Third Expression**\n\n\\[\n3(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3)\n\\]\n  \n- Distributing \\(3\\):\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 1 = 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 2x = 6x\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 3x^2 = 9x^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 4x^3 = 12x^3\n  \\]\n  \n  **So, \\( 3(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3) = 3 + 6x + 9x^2 + 12x^3 \\)**\n\n**Reflection Check:**  \nAgain, distributing each term seems straightforward. Everything checks out so far.\n\n### **Step 3: Expanding the Fourth Expression**\n\n\\[\n-4(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4)\n\\]\n  \n- Distributing \\(-4\\):\n  \\[\n  -4 \\times 1 = -4\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -4 \\times 2x = -8x\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -4 \\times 3x^2 = -12x^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -4 \\times 4x^3 = -16x^3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -4 \\times 5x^4 = -20x^4\n  \\]\n  \n  **So, \\( -4(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4) = -4 - 8x - 12x^2 - 16x^3 - 20x^4 \\)**\n\n**Reflection Check:**  \nDistributing negative four seems to have worked well. No errors detected.\n\n### **Step 4: Combining All the Expanded Terms**\n\nNow, let's put everything together:\n\n\\[\n(1 + 2x) + (-2 - 4x - 6x^2) + (3 + 6x + 9x^2 + 12x^3) + (-4 - 8x - 12x^2 - 16x^3 - 20x^4)\n\\]\n\n**Let's rearrange them by grouping like terms:**\n\n- **Constant Terms:**\n  \\[\n  1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(x\\) Terms:**\n  \\[\n  2x - 4x + 6x - 8x = -4x\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(x^2\\) Terms:**\n  \\[\n  -6x^2 + 9x^2 - 12x^2 = -9x^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(x^3\\) Terms:**\n  \\[\n  12x^3 - 16x^3 = -4x^3\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(x^4\\) Terms:**\n  \\[\n  -20x^4\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection Check:**  \nWait a minute... does this look right? The constant term adds up to \\(-2\\), which seems okay. The \\(x\\) term is \\(-4x\\), which doesn't seem right based on what I've done before. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\n**Quick Re-check:**  \nOh, I see the mistake. I didn't account for all the terms properly when combining. Let's make sure to add each term correctly.\n\n**Re-doing \\(x\\) Terms:**\n\n\\[\n2x - 4x + 6x - 8x = (2 - 4 + 6 - 8)x = (-2 + 6 - 8)x = (4 - 8)x = -4x \n\\]\n\nSo, the earlier result was correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Writing the Combined Expression**\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n\\[\n-2 - 4x - 9x^2 - 4x^3 - 20x^4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection Check:**  \nThis looks correct. Each term has been combined accurately.\n\n### **Step 6: Identifying the Coefficient of \\(x\\)**\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x\\) in the simplified expression is **\\(-4\\)**.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nLet me quickly scan through to ensure everything aligns. The constant term is \\(-2\\). All \\(x\\) terms add up to \\(-4x\\). The higher-degree terms also seem to combine correctly. No inconsistencies here.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully expanding each term, combining like terms, and checking the calculations multiple times, the coefficient of \\(x\\) in the simplified expression is **\\(-4\\)**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nInitially, I wasn't sure whether expanding everything was the best approach, but it ended up being straightforward. Checking at each step helped catch any potential mistakes early on. By the end, everything aligned, and the coefficient of \\(x\\) confidently came out to be \\(-4\\).",
