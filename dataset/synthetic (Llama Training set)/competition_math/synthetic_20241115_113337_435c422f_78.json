    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming and exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work as I progress. It's important to think out loud, even if my initial thoughts are messy or uncertain.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nI see the question involves a line passing through the point \\((4, 365)\\) with a \\(y\\)-intercept between 1 and 9. I'm asked to find the **minimum possible slope** of this line.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Linear Equation:** I remember that the equation of a line is \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b\\) is the \\(y\\)-intercept. So, I need to connect these ideas.\n- **Given Point:** The line passes through \\((4, 365)\\), which means this point satisfies the equation.\n- **Range for \\(b\\):** The \\(y\\)-intercept (\\(b\\)) is between 1 and 9, inclusive.\n\n**Checking if This Makes Sense:**\n- I need to find the slope (\\(m\\)) that makes this line possible with the given \\(y\\)-intercept range.\n- Intuitively, the slope affects how steep the line is. A minimum slope might mean the line is less steep, possibly negative.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Linear Equation Formula:**\n   - Plug in the given point to the line equation.\n   - Set up equations using the possible \\(y\\)-intercepts to solve for \\(m\\).\n\n2. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Sketch the line with the given point and \\(y\\)-intercept range to visually identify the minimum slope.\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:**\n   - Rearrange the line equation to isolate \\(m\\) and impose the \\(y\\)-intercept constraints.\n\n**Which to Try First?**\n- The **linear equation formula** seems straightforward since I can directly use the given point and \\(y\\)-intercept range.\n- If this gets messy or unclear, I might switch to a graphical approach to gain better intuition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Linear Equation Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Start with the basic equation of a line: \\(y = mx + b\\).\n- Plug in the given point \\((4, 365)\\).\n- Set up a relationship between \\(m\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n365 = 4m + b\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- This equation alone doesn't help since \\(b\\) is within a range (1 to 9).\n- I need to relate \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) further using the boundaries of \\(b\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up Boundary Conditions for \\(b\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since \\(b\\) must be between 1 and 9, I'll set up two inequalities using the equation from Step 1.\n- This will help me find the corresponding slopes (\\(m\\)) at these boundaries.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n**Lower Bound: \\(b = 1\\)**\n\\[\n365 = 4m + 1 \\\\\n364 = 4m \\\\\nm = \\frac{364}{4} = 91\n\\]\n\n**Upper Bound: \\(b = 9\\)**\n\\[\n365 = 4m + 9 \\\\\n356 = 4m \\\\\nm = \\frac{356}{4} = 89\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, the possible slopes (\\(m\\)) range from 89 to 91.\n- **Wait a minute\u2026** That seems counterintuitive. Shouldn't the minimum slope be less steep, possibly negative? Let me double-check this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Checking:**\n- I initially thought a minimum slope might be negative, but here both calculated slopes are positive.\n- **Maybe I misunderstood the question.** The minimum slope **within the given \\(y\\)-intercept range** is indeed 89, as the \\(y\\)-intercept affects the slope's value.\n\n**Insight:**\n- The slopes I calculated correspond to the extreme \\(y\\)-intercepts (1 and 9).\n- Since the question asks for the minimum possible slope, it would be **89**, as per the calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Cross-Verification Using Graphical Intuition**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's think about it graphically: The line must pass through \\((4, 365)\\) and have a \\(y\\)-intercept between 1 and 9.\n- A line with a slope of 89 is less steep than one with a slope of 91.\n\n**Graphical Approach:**\n- **Sketch Idea:** Draw a line passing through \\((4, 365)\\). Adjust the \\(y\\)-intercept within the range to see how the slope changes.\n- **Observation:** Lower \\(y\\)-intercepts (closer to 1) result in steeper lines (higher slopes), while higher \\(y\\)-intercepts (closer to 9) result in less steep lines (lower slopes).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Hmm...** This aligns with the earlier calculations. A \\(y\\)-intercept of 9 gives a slope of 89, which is the minimum within the given range.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection and Confirmation**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The calculations and graphical intuition point to **89** as the minimum possible slope.\n- **Does it make sense?** Yes, because with a higher \\(y\\)-intercept (9), the line is less steep, thus minimizing the slope.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Calculation: \\(m = \\frac{356}{4} = 89\\)\n- Interpretation: Slope of 89 means for every unit increase in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) increases by 89 units, which is less steep than a slope of 91.\n\n**Final Insight:**\n- The **minimum possible slope** of the line, given the constraints, is **89**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe **minimum possible slope** of the line is **89**.",

  "ground_truth": "We don't know the $y$-intercept, so let the $y$-intercept be $a$, where $1\\le a \\le 9$. Our line contains the points $(0,a)$ and $(4,365)$, so its slope is $\\frac{365-a}{4-0}=\\frac{365-a}{4}$. We are trying to find the smallest possible value of this expression, to minimize the slope. The denominator is fixed, so we must find the smallest possible value of the numerator, $365-a$. The smallest value will occur when $a$ is as large as possible, so $a=9$. Then the slope will be $\\frac{365-9}{4}=\\frac{356}{4}=\\boxed{89}$."
