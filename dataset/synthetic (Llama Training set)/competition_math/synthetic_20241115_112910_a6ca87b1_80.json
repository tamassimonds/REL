    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work often, and reflecting on whether I'm on the right track or need to adjust my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{2n}{3^n} - \\frac{1}{2^n} \\right)\n\\]\n\nI recognize it as an **infinite series**. Specifically, it's a **power series** involving terms with \\(n\\) in both the numerator and the denominator. Infinite series can be tricky, especially when they involve powers of \\(n\\), so I need to think carefully about how to approach it.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n\n1. **Geometric Series:** I remember that series involving terms like \\(\\frac{1}{a^n}\\) are geometric. Maybe I can break this down into geometric series?\n\n2. **Manipulating the Series:** Perhaps I can separate the two parts of the series and tackle each one individually.\n\n3. **Series Convergence:** Ensuring the series converges is crucial. I need to think about the ratios and whether they converge to zero.\n\n4. **Alternative Methods:** If that doesn't work, maybe consider using the **Ratio Test** or **Comparison Test** to analyze convergence.\n\nHmm, breaking it into two separate series seems like a straightforward starting point. Let's try that and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Breaking Down the Series**\n\nI'll separate the given series into two parts:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{2n}{3^n} - \\frac{1}{2^n} \\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2n}{3^n} - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- The second series, \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n}\\), looks familiar. I know it's a geometric series with a common ratio less than 1, so it should converge.\n\n- The first series, \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2n}{3^n}\\), involves \\(n\\) in the numerator, which is less common. I might need to use a different strategy here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes separating the series make sense? Yes, because it allows me to handle each part individually, which simplifies the problem. Let's proceed with this approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating the Second Series**\n\nFirst, I'll tackle the simpler series:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- This is a **geometric series** where the first term \\(a = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and the common ratio \\(r = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n- I know geometric series converge when \\(|r| < 1\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{a}{1 - r} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because geometric series converge to a finite value when the common ratio is less than 1.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe second series converges to 1. This part is straightforward and confirms that my separation was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluating the First Series**\n\nNow, I'll focus on the more complex series:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2n}{3^n}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- The presence of \\(n\\) in the numerator suggests that this isn't a simple geometric series.\n\n- Perhaps I can relate it to the derivative of a geometric series.\n\n- Another idea is to use the **Ratio Test** to confirm convergence before finding the sum.\n\n**Exploring the Geometric Series Derivative Approach:**\n\nI remember that differentiating a geometric series with respect to its variable can help bring down the \\(n\\) in the exponent. Here's what I recall:\n\n- The sum of a geometric series is:\n\n  \\[\n  S = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n = \\frac{1}{1 - x} \\quad \\text{for} \\ |x| < 1\n  \\]\n\n- If I differentiate both sides with respect to \\(x\\), I get:\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{dS}{dx} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n x^{n-1} = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}\n  \\]\n\n- Multiplying both sides by \\(x\\) gives:\n\n  \\[\n  \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n x^n = \\frac{x}{(1 - x)^2}\n  \\]\n\n  **Forming an Equation:**\n\n  I can use this result to sum series of the form \\(\\sum n x^n\\).\n\n**Applying to Our Series:**\n\nIn our series:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2n}{3^n}\n\\]\n\nWe can set \\(x = \\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{4}{9}} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\n**But Wait...**\n\nI notice that in our original series, there's a \\(2n\\) in the numerator. So, I need to multiply the result by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2n}{3^n} = 2 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, multiplying by 2 aligns with the original series structure.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUsing the derivative of the geometric series was a clever move here. It streamlined the process and avoided more complex summation techniques.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combining the Results**\n\nNow, I'll subtract the two series' sums:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{2n}{3^n} - \\frac{1}{2^n} \\right) = \\frac{3}{2} - 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- The first series converged to \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) and the second to 1.\n\n- Subtracting them should give the final result.\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs \\(\\frac{3}{2} - 1\\) indeed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)? Yes, the arithmetic checks out.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe final answer seems consistent with the individual series evaluations. Everything adds up logically.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore concluding, let's ensure all steps align:\n\n1. **Separation of Series:** Correctly split the original series into two manageable parts.\n  \n2. **Second Series Evaluation:** Confirmed that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n} = 1\\).\n  \n3. **First Series Evaluation Using Geometric Series Derivative:** Validated that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2n}{3^n} = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n  \n4. **Combining Results:** Correctly computed \\(\\frac{3}{2} - 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nEverything checks out, and the approach feels solid.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{2n}{3^n} - \\frac{1}{2^n} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by considering different strategies, including separating the series and identifying geometric series components.\n\n- **Exploration:** Evaluated each series individually, using known formulas and properties of geometric series.\n\n- **Checks and Reflections:** Continuously checked the correctness of each step, ensuring that the approach aligned with mathematical principles.\n\n- **Final Verification:** Ensured that all components combined correctly to yield the final answer.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant reflection and checking, led to a confident and accurate solution.",
