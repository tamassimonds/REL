    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it like I would if I were tackling it on paper, thinking aloud, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, and checking my work as I go. This should give a more human-like thought process, complete with initial confusion, brainstorming, missteps, and those \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the equation\n\n$$(x^2 - 4x + 3)(x + 5) - (x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - c) = 0$$ for all $x$,\n\nI think, **\"This looks like an equation involving polynomials. Maybe I need to expand it or simplify somehow.\"** Expanding polynomials is something I'm familiar with, but I'm also aware that there might be a need to factor or collect like terms afterward. \n\nAnother possibility is **\"Could I set coefficients equal since this must hold for all $x$?\"** That often works when dealing with polynomial equations. But before jumping into that, maybe I'll start with expanding to see where it leads.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Expand Both Sides:** \n   - This seems like a straightforward start. By expanding, I can see the full expression and perhaps identify patterns or simplifications.\n\n2. **Set Coefficients Equal:**\n   - After expansion, setting coefficients of like terms equal could help in solving for $c$.\n\n3. **Factorization:**\n   - Maybe there's a way to factor the expression to simplify before expanding, but that might complicate things initially.\n\n**Reflection:** Expanding seems like the most direct approach to start with, so I'll go ahead with that. If it gets messy, I can consider factoring or other methods later.\n\n### **Step 1: Expanding the Left Side**\n\nLet\u2019s expand the left side step by step.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nOkay, I need to distribute each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. This reminds me of the distributive property I learned.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n$$(x^2 - 4x + 3)(x + 5) = x^2 \\cdot (x + 5) - 4x \\cdot (x + 5) + 3 \\cdot (x + 5)$$\n\n- **First Term:** \n  $$x^2 \\cdot x + x^2 \\cdot 5 = x^3 + 5x^2$$\n  \n- **Second Term:** \n  $$-4x \\cdot x - 4x \\cdot 5 = -4x^2 - 20x$$\n  \n- **Third Term:** \n  $$3 \\cdot x + 3 \\cdot 5 = 3x + 15$$\n  \n**Combining Like Terms:**\n\n$$(x^3 + 5x^2) + (-4x^2 - 20x) + (3x + 15)$$\n\n$$= x^3 + (5x^2 - 4x^2) + (-20x + 3x) + 15$$\n\n$$= x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15$$\n\n**Check:**\nThat looks good. The terms seem to combine correctly.\n\n### **Step 2: Expanding the Right Side**\n\nNow, let's expand the right side.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI\u2019ll use the same distributive property here. It feels similar to the left side, so I expect a similar process.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n$$(x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - c) = x^2 \\cdot (x - c) + 4x \\cdot (x - c) - 5 \\cdot (x - c)$$\n\n- **First Term:** \n  $$x^2 \\cdot x - x^2 \\cdot c = x^3 - cx^2$$\n  \n- **Second Term:** \n  $$4x \\cdot x - 4x \\cdot c = 4x^2 - 4cx$$\n  \n- **Third Term:** \n  $$-5 \\cdot x - (-5) \\cdot c = -5x + 5c$$\n  \n**Combining Like Terms:**\n\n$$(x^3 - cx^2) + (4x^2 - 4cx) + (-5x + 5c)$$\n\n$$= x^3 + (-c + 4)x^2 + (-5 - 4c)x + 5c$$\n\n**Check:**\nWait a second\u2014this looks a bit off. Let me double-check my distribution.\n\n**Reflection:**\nDid I make a mistake in signs? Let\u2019s see....\n\n**Re-examining the Second Term:**\n\nAh, I see. When distributing $-5$, I missed switching the sign correctly for $-(-5 \\cdot c)$.\n\n**Correction:**\n\n$$-5 \\cdot x - (-5) \\cdot c = -5x + 5c$$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSo the corrected right side is:\n\n$$x^3 + (-c + 4)x^2 + (-5 - 4c)x + 5c$$\n\n### **Step 3: Setting the Expanded Expressions Equal**\n\nNow, we set both expanded sides equal to each other since the original equation equals zero for all $x$.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince this must hold for all $x$, the coefficients of corresponding powers of $x$ must be equal. This is a key insight.\n\n**Equation:**\n\n$$x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15 = x^3 + (-c + 4)x^2 + (-5 - 4c)x + 5c$$\n\n### **Step 4: Equating Coefficients**\n\nLet\u2019s equate the coefficients of like terms.\n\n- **Coefficients of \\(x^3\\):**\n  $$1 = 1 \\quad \\text{(this is consistent)}$$\n  \n- **Coefficients of \\(x^2\\):**\n  $$1 = -c + 4$$\n  \n- **Coefficients of \\(x\\):**\n  $$-17 = -5 - 4c$$\n  \n- **Constant Terms:**\n  $$15 = 5c$$\n\n**Check:**\nThese equations look correct. Now, let's solve them step by step.\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the System of Equations**\n\nWe have three equations to solve for \\(c\\). Let's tackle them one by one.\n\n**Equation 1:**\n$$1 = -c + 4$$\n\n**Solving for \\(c\\):**\n\n$$-c = 1 - 4$$\n\n$$-c = -3$$\n\n$$c = 3$$\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, does this satisfy the other equations? Let\u2019s quickly check.\n\n**Equation 2:**\n$$-17 = -5 - 4c$$\n\nSubstituting \\(c = 3\\):\n\n$$-17 = -5 - 4(3)$$\n\n$$-17 = -5 - 12$$\n\n$$-17 = -17 \\quad \\text{(consistent)}$$\n\n**Equation 3:**\n$$15 = 5c$$\n\n$$15 = 5(3)$$\n\n$$15 = 15 \\quad \\text{(consistent)}$$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll equations are satisfied with \\(c = 3\\). So, \\(c = 3\\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n### **Step 6: Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s quickly verify by substituting \\(c = 3\\) back into the original equation.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nDoes substituting \\(c = 3\\) make both sides equal? If so, our solution is correct.\n\n**Original Equation with \\(c = 3\\):**\n\n$$(x^2 - 4x + 3)(x + 5) - (x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - 3) = 0$$\n\n**Expanding Both Sides Again:**\n\n**Left Side:**\n\n$$(x^2 - 4x + 3)(x + 5) = x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15$$\n\n**Right Side:**\n\n$$(x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - 3) = x^3 + (-3 + 4)x^2 + (-5 - 4(-3))x + 5(-3)$$\n\n$$= x^3 + x^2 + x - 15$$\n\n**Difference:**\n\n$$x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15 - (x^3 + x^2 + x - 15) = 0$$\n\n$$x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15 - x^3 - x^2 - x + 15 = 0$$\n\n$$(-17x - (-x)) + (15 - 15) = 0$$\n\n$$(-17x + x) + 0 = 0$$\n\n$$-16x = 0$$\n\n**Check:**\nWait, this should equal zero for all \\(x\\), but it simplifies to \\(-16x = 0\\). That only holds true if \\(x = 0\\). \n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, this suggests that our solution might not be correct, or perhaps there's an inconsistency. Let me think about it.\n\n**Issue Identification:**\nThe original equation was set to equal zero for all \\(x\\), but after substituting \\(c = 3\\), we only get zero for \\(x = 0\\). This indicates that \\(c = 3\\) might not be the correct solution.\n\n### **Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nMaybe I made an error in equating the coefficients or in my calculations. Let\u2019s re-examine the steps.\n\n**Re-examining Coefficients:**\n\nLooking back at the original coefficients:\n\n- **Coefficients of \\(x^2\\):**\n  $$1 = -c + 4 \\Rightarrow c = 3$$\n  \n- **Coefficients of \\(x\\):**\n  $$-17 = -5 - 4c \\Rightarrow -17 = -5 - 4(3) \\Rightarrow -17 = -17 \\quad \\text{(consistent)}$$\n  \n- **Constant Terms:**\n  $$15 = 5c \\Rightarrow c = 3$$\n\n**Observation:**\nAll three equations consistently lead to \\(c = 3\\). However, the final check suggests otherwise.\n\n**Possible Explanation:**\nThe issue might stem from how the original equation was set up or from the assumption that \\(c\\) is constant. Perhaps there's a hidden dependency or additional condition that hasn't been accounted for.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\nInstead of assuming \\(c\\) is a constant, maybe \\(c\\) could be a polynomial expression that still satisfies the equation for all \\(x\\). But that feels more complex and isn't hinted at in the problem.\n\n### **Brainstorming Again**\n\nGiven that \\(c = 3\\) leads to inconsistency, I need to reconsider the problem. Maybe there's a misinterpretation.\n\nAnother possible angle is **\"Could there be a mistake in the expansion?\"** Let\u2019s double-check the expansion steps.\n\n### **Step 7: Re-examining the Expansion**\n\n**Left Side Re-expansion:**\n$$(x^2 - 4x + 3)(x + 5)$$\n\n- **First Term:** \n  $$x^2 \\cdot x + x^2 \\cdot 5 = x^3 + 5x^2$$\n  \n- **Second Term:** \n  $$-4x \\cdot x - 4x \\cdot 5 = -4x^2 - 20x$$\n  \n- **Third Term:** \n  $$3 \\cdot x + 3 \\cdot 5 = 3x + 15$$\n  \n**Combining:**\n$$x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x^2 - 20x + 3x + 15 = x^3 + (5 - 4)x^2 + (-20 + 3)x + 15 = x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15$$\n\n**Right Side Re-expansion:**\n$$(x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - c)$$\n\n- **First Term:** \n  $$x^2 \\cdot x - x^2 \\cdot c = x^3 - cx^2$$\n  \n- **Second Term:** \n  $$4x \\cdot x - 4x \\cdot c = 4x^2 - 4cx$$\n  \n- **Third Term:** \n  $$-5 \\cdot x - (-5) \\cdot c = -5x + 5c$$\n  \n**Conclusion:**\nOddly, I still arrive at\n\n$$x^3 - cx^2 + 4x^2 - 4cx - 5x + 5c = x^3 + (-c + 4)x^2 + (-5 - 4c)x + 5c$$\n\nBut earlier, when checking with \\(c = 3\\), there was inconsistency. \n\n**Re-Reflection:**\nMaybe there\u2019s a misstep in how coefficients were equated or interpreted. Perhaps multiple solutions exist, or there\u2019s another dependency between terms not initially considered.\n\n### **Step 8: Exploring Alternative Approaches**\n\nSince the direct method led to inconsistency, perhaps **\"Is there a simpler way to find \\(c\\)?\"** \n\nOne alternative is to **use specific values of \\(x\\)** to create equations involving \\(c\\). This method sometimes helps bypass complex expansions.\n\n**Let\u2019s Try This:**\n\nChoose specific \\(x\\) values that simplify the equation.\n\n**Example:**\nLet\u2019s set \\(x = 1\\):\n\n$$(1^2 - 4(1) + 3)(1 + 5) - (1^2 + 4(1) - 5)(1 - c) = 0$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$(1 - 4 + 3)(6) - (1 + 4 - 5)(1 - c) = 0$$\n\n$$(0)(6) - (0)(1 - c) = 0$$\n\n$$0 - 0 = 0$$\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis doesn't provide new information since both sides equal zero. \n\n**Trying Another Value:**\n\nLet\u2019s set \\(x = 0\\):\n\n$$(0^2 - 4(0) + 3)(0 + 5) - (0^2 + 4(0) - 5)(0 - c) = 0$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$(3)(5) - (-5)(-c) = 0$$\n\n$$15 - 5c = 0$$\n\n$$5c = 15$$\n\n$$c = 3$$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAgain, \\(c = 3\\), but still, substituting back leads to inconsistency.\n\n**Alternative Insight:**\nPerhaps the problem has no real solution for \\(c\\) that satisfies the equation for all \\(x\\). Or, maybe there\u2019s a misunderstanding in the problem's setup.\n\n### **Step 9: Final Reflection and Brainstorming**\n\nGiven the repetitive outcome of \\(c = 3\\) and the subsequent inconsistency, it's clear that something isn't aligning.\n\n**Possible Explanations:**\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of the Problem:**\n   - Perhaps the equation setup is misinterpreted. Are there additional conditions or constraints not mentioned?\n\n2. **Polynomial Identity Issue:**\n   - Maybe the left and right sides are not identical polynomials, leading to a dependency on \\(x\\) values.\n\n3. **Assumption Error:**\n   - Assuming \\(c\\) is a constant might be too limiting. Perhaps \\(c\\) is not a single value but a condition imposed by the equation.\n\n**Brainstorming Next Steps:**\n\n- **Re-assess the Problem Statement:**\n  - Ensure that the equation is correctly interpreted.\n\n- **Consider Alternative Solutions:**\n  - Perhaps multiple values of \\(c\\) could satisfy different conditions, or the problem has no solution.\n\n- **Seek Patterns or Symmetries:**\n  - Look for inherent symmetries or patterns in the polynomials that could suggest a relationship.\n\n### **Step 10: Leveraging Symmetry in Polynomials**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWait a minute, maybe I can use the fact that the equation holds for all \\(x\\) to infer something about the polynomials involved.\n\nLooking closely at the original equation:\n\n$$(x^2 - 4x + 3)(x + 5) - (x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - c) = 0$$\n\nThe polynomials seem structured such that their difference equals zero for all \\(x\\). This suggests that the two expressions are identical.\n\n**Alternative Insight:**\nPerhaps for the equation to hold for all \\(x\\), the terms involving \\(x\\) must cancel out completely, implying that:\n\n$$(x^2 - 4x + 3)(x + 5) = (x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - c)$$\n\n**Reformulating:**\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n$$(x^2 - 4x + 3)(x + 5) = (x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - c)$$\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThis equality must hold for all \\(x\\), implying that the polynomials on both sides are identical. Therefore, the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\(x\\) must be equal.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\nInstead of equating coefficients directly, let's manipulate the equation to isolate \\(c\\).\n\n**Step 1: Expand Both Sides**\n\nAs done earlier, but ensuring all terms are correctly accounted for.\n\n**Left Side:**\n\n$$(x^2 - 4x + 3)(x + 5) = x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15$$\n\n**Right Side:**\n\n$$(x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - c) = x^3 + (4 - c)x^2 + (-5 + 4c)x + 5c$$\n\n**Equation:**\n\n$$x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15 = x^3 + (4 - c)x^2 + (-5 + 4c)x + 5c$$\n\n**Step 2: Equate Coefficients**\n\n- **Coefficients of \\(x^3\\):**\n  $$1 = 1 \\quad \\text{(consistent)}$$\n  \n- **Coefficients of \\(x^2\\):**\n  $$1 = 4 - c \\quad \\Rightarrow c = 3$$\n  \n- **Coefficients of \\(x\\):**\n  $$-17 = -5 + 4c \\quad \\Rightarrow -17 = -5 + 4(3) \\quad \\Rightarrow -17 = -17 \\quad \\text{(consistent)}$$\n  \n- **Constants:**\n  $$15 = 5c \\quad \\Rightarrow c = 3$$\n\n**Check:**\nAgain, all coefficients lead to \\(c = 3\\), but the final check showed inconsistency. This suggests that while mathematically, \\(c = 3\\) satisfies the coefficient equations, the initial condition of the equation holding for all \\(x\\) imposes additional constraints that aren't immediately apparent.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nGiven the repeating outcome and the contradiction in the final check, it's likely that the problem has an oversight or that additional conditions are required. For instance, perhaps the original equation is meant to hold for specific values of \\(x\\) rather than all \\(x\\).\n\n### **Step 11: Considering the Original Problem's Requirements**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe problem states finding the constant \\(c\\) such that the equation holds for all \\(x\\). If \\(c = 3\\) leads to constraints that only hold for specific \\(x\\) values, then \\(c = 3\\) might not be the correct solution.\n\n**Possible Alternative:**\nPerhaps the equation has no real solution for \\(c\\) that satisfies the condition for all \\(x\\), or the problem setup requires a different approach, such as considering \\(c\\) as a variable dependent on \\(x\\), although that seems unlikely given the problem's wording.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\nIf assuming \\(c\\) is constant leads to contradictions, maybe \\(c\\) must satisfy additional relationships between the polynomials that aren't captured by simple coefficient comparison.\n\n**New Approach:**\nConsider factoring or simplifying the original equation to see if it reveals a relationship involving \\(c\\), but given the complexity, perhaps this isn't the best path.\n\n### **Step 12: Seeking Patterns**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nMaybe there's a pattern or identity within the polynomials that can simplify the equation. For instance, recognizing that certain terms are perfect squares or other factorizable forms.\n\n**Potential Factorization:**\nLet's attempt to factor the left side:\n\n$$(x^2 - 4x + 3)(x + 5) = (x - 1)(x - 3)(x + 5) = (x - 1)(x^2 + 2x - 15)$$\n\nThe right side:\n\n$$(x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - c) = (x + 5)(x - c)(x - 1)$$\n\nThis suggests the equation simplifies to:\n\n$$(x - 1)(x^2 + 2x - 15) = (x + 5)(x - c)(x - 1)$$\n\nAssuming \\(x \\neq 1\\), we can cancel \\(x - 1\\) from both sides:\n\n$$x^2 + 2x - 15 = (x + 5)(x - c)$$\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n$$(x + 5)(x - c) = x^2 - cx + 5x - 5c = x^2 + (5 - c)x - 5c$$\n\nSetting both sides equal:\n\n$$x^2 + 2x - 15 = x^2 + (5 - c)x - 5c$$\n\nCancelling \\(x^2\\) terms and rearranging:\n\n$$(2 - (5 - c))x = -15 + 5c$$\n\n$$(2 - 5 + c)x = -15 + 5c$$\n\n$$(c - 3)x = -15 + 5c$$\n\nFor this to hold for all \\(x\\), the coefficient of \\(x\\) must be zero:\n\n$$c - 3 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c = 3$$\n\nBut again, substituting \\(c = 3\\) leads to:\n\n$$(3 - 3)x = -15 + 15$$\n\n$$0x = 0$$\n\nThis implies the equation is tautological (always true) for all \\(x\\), suggesting that \\(c = 3\\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter multiple reflections, checks, and considering various strategies, it's clear that \\(c = 3\\) satisfies the coefficient equations derived from equating the expanded polynomials. Despite the initial inconsistency when substituting back into the original equation, this factorization approach shows that \\(c = 3\\) is valid.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe constant \\(c\\) is **3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nIt's interesting how starting with a straightforward expansion led to confusion due to inconsistency. This prompted a re-examination of the problem, where recognizing that the equation must hold for all \\(x\\) allowed for a simpler solution through factorization. It underscores the importance of checking assumptions and being open to alternative methods when faced with contradictions.\n\nReflecting on the process, it\u2019s clear that while multiple strategies can lead to the same solution, verifying each step ensures confidence in the result. Initially misinterpreting the problem's requirements led to dead ends, but re-thinking the approach\u2014considering canceling common factors\u2014clarified that \\(c = 3\\) is indeed correct. It\u2019s a valuable reminder of the depth and flexibility needed in problem-solving, especially in polynomial equations.",
