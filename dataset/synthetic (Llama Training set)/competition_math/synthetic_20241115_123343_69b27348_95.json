    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I\u2019ll brainstorm, explore different strategies, and reflect often to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, **|2n - 7| = 3**, my immediate reaction is that this involves absolute values. Absolute value equations typically have two possible cases because the expression inside can be positive or negative.\n\n#### **Initial Brainstorming:**\n1. **Absolute Value Properties:** I remember that |x| = a means x = a or x = -a.\n2. **Creating Two Equations:** So, I can set up two separate equations to solve for n: one where the inside is positive and another where it's negative.\n3. **Possible Strategies:** \n   - Solve the two equations separately.\n   - Check if there\u2019s a way to simplify or verify solutions easily.\n\nBut before jumping in, let me jot down what I know:\n- **Absolute value equations have two solutions** because the expression can equal the positive or negative of the given number.\n- I should expect **two values of n** as solutions unless there's some restriction.\n\nDoes this make sense? I think so, but let me proceed and see if the steps lead me there.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Two Equations**\n\nThinking it through, I need to apply the property of absolute values:\n\n\\[\n|2n - 7| = 3 \\implies 2n - 7 = 3 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2n - 7 = -3\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nThis looks correct because absolute value equations split into two cases. Let me write them down:\n\n1. **Positive Case:** 2n - 7 = 3\n2. **Negative Case:** 2n - 7 = -3\n\nSo, I\u2019ll solve these two equations separately for n.\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Positive Case**\n\n**Equation:** \\(2n - 7 = 3\\)\n\nAlright, I\u2019ll add 7 to both sides to isolate the term with n:\n\n\\[\n2n - 7 + 7 = 3 + 7 \\implies 2n = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to solve for n:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\n#### **Quick Check:**\nDoes n = 5 satisfy the original equation?\n\n\\[\n|2(5) - 7| = |10 - 7| = |3| = 3\n\\]\n\nYes, it works! That\u2019s a good sign. One solution found.\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Negative Case**\n\n**Equation:** \\(2n - 7 = -3\\)\n\nNow, I\u2019ll add 7 to both sides again:\n\n\\[\n2n - 7 + 7 = -3 + 7 \\implies 2n = 4\n\\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\n#### **Quick Check:**\nLet\u2019s check if n = 2 satisfies the original equation:\n\n\\[\n|2(2) - 7| = |4 - 7| = |-3| = 3\n\\]\n\nIt works too! So, n = 2 is also a valid solution.\n\n### **Step 4: Listing the Solutions**\n\nI\u2019ve found two solutions:\n- **n = 5**\n- **n = 2**\n\n#### **Reflection:**\nWait, the problem asks for the **sum of the values of n** that satisfy the equation. I almost missed that! So, I need to add these two solutions together.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Sum**\n\nLet\u2019s add the two solutions:\n\n\\[\n5 + 2 = 7\n\\]\n\n#### **Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Adding the two solutions seems straightforward. No red flags here.\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Approach**\n\nLet me think back. The approach involved:\n- Splitting the absolute value equation into two separate cases.\n- Solving each case independently.\n- Verifying each solution satisfies the original equation.\n- Adding the valid solutions to find the required sum.\n\nI followed the standard procedure for absolute value equations, and both solutions checked out.\n\n#### **Final Reflection:**\nEverything seems correct. The strategy worked well, and the checks confirm the solutions are valid.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe sum of the values of n that satisfy the equation **|2n - 7| = 3** is **7**.\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n- **Brainstorming helped:** Initially considering the properties of absolute values guided me to set up two equations.\n- **Checking is crucial:** Verifying each solution ensured accuracy.\n- **Reflecting kept me on track:** Reminding myself what the problem asked for (the sum) prevented oversight.\n\nBy approaching the problem step by step and continuously reflecting on each part, I ensured a thorough and correct solution.",
