    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking my work regularly, and adjusting my approach as needed. It's important to approach this like I would if I were solving it manually, reflecting and brainstorming along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n- **Initial Reaction**: This reminds me of problems involving inverse functions. Maybe I need to leverage the properties of inverses here.\n- **Keywords**: The term \\( g(x) = f^{-1}(x) \\) stands out. Inverse functions come to mind.\n- **Given Information**: I have specific values for \\( g(x) \\): \\( g(-15) = 0 \\), \\( g(0) = 3 \\), \\( g(3) = 9 \\), and \\( g(9) = 20 \\). These mappings could be crucial.\n- **Goal**: I need to find \\( f(f(9)) \\). This seems like a two-step application of \\( f \\).\n\nBut to be honest, I'm a bit unsure if that's the direct path to the solution. Let me brainstorm different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions**: Since \\( g(x) = f^{-1}(x) \\), maybe \\( g(a) = b \\) implies \\( f(b) = a \\). So perhaps I can use the given \\( g \\) values to backtrack to \\( f \\).\n   \n2. **Mapping Given Values**: I could create a table to map \\( g(x) \\) to \\( f(f(y)) \\) values, assuming I know how \\( f \\) operates.\n   \n3. **Finding \\( f(9) \\) First**: Maybe by determining \\( f(9) \\), I can proceed to find \\( f(f(9)) \\).\n\nWait, looking at these ideas, I realize I don't have an explicit form for \\( f(x) \\), which complicates things. Perhaps I need to focus on the relationships between \\( g \\) and \\( f \\) instead.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Inverse Function Property**\n\nNow, reflecting on the properties of inverse functions:\n\n- If \\( g(x) = f^{-1}(x) \\), then applying \\( f \\) to \\( g(x) \\) should give me back \\( x \\). In other words:\n  \\[\n  f(g(x)) = x\n  \\]\n  \n- Given this, perhaps I can use the known \\( g(x) \\) values to find corresponding \\( f(x) \\) values.\n\nLet me see how this applies to the given data.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying the Inverse Function Property**\n\nLet's take the provided mappings one by one:\n\n1. **From \\( g(-15) = 0 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   g(-15) = 0 \\implies f(0) = -15\n   \\]\n   \n2. **From \\( g(0) = 3 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   g(0) = 3 \\implies f(3) = 0\n   \\]\n   \n3. **From \\( g(3) = 9 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   g(3) = 9 \\implies f(9) = 3\n   \\]\n   \n4. **From \\( g(9) = 20 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   g(9) = 20 \\implies f(20) = 9\n   \\]\n\nHmm, this seems to create a mapping where \\( f(x) \\) maps back to earlier inputs. But wait, is there a pattern or structure here? Let me think.\n\n---\n\n### **Looking for Patterns in the Mappings**\n\nNow, trying to see if there's a compositional pattern:\n\n- **Mapping Chain**:\n  - \\( g(-15) = 0 \\) \u21d2 \\( f(0) = -15 \\)\n  - \\( g(0) = 3 \\) \u21d2 \\( f(3) = 0 \\)\n  - \\( g(3) = 9 \\) \u21d2 \\( f(9) = 3 \\)\n  - \\( g(9) = 20 \\) \u21d2 \\( f(20) = 9 \\)\n  \nThis looks like a cycling or looping pattern, where each output feeds into the next input. But I need to find \\( f(f(9)) \\). Let's see where \\( f(9) = 3 \\) leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Determining \\( f(f(9)) \\)**\n\nGiven \\( f(9) = 3 \\), I need to find \\( f(f(9)) = f(3) \\).\n\nFrom our earlier mapping:\n\\[\nf(3) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( f(f(9)) = 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's check if this makes sense with the inverse properties:\n\n- **Given \\( g(3) = 9 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  g(3) = 9 \\implies f(9) = 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **And \\( f(3) = 0 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  f(3) = 0 \\implies f(f(9)) = f(3) = 0\n  \\]\n  \nThis aligns perfectly with the definitions. So the answer seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nThroughout this problem, I relied heavily on the properties of inverse functions, specifically that \\( g(x) = f^{-1}(x) \\) implies \\( f(g(x)) = x \\). By systematically applying this property to the given \\( g(x) \\) values, I was able to map back to the corresponding \\( f(x) \\) values and find \\( f(f(9)) \\).\n\nInitially, I considered different strategies, including trying to map \\( f \\) directly, but realized that leveraging the inverse relationships was the most straightforward path. Checking each step ensured that the mappings were consistent, leading to the correct conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**: \\( f(f(9)) = 0 \\)\n\nThis process highlights the importance of understanding function properties and systematically applying them, checking for consistency at each step to ensure accuracy.",
