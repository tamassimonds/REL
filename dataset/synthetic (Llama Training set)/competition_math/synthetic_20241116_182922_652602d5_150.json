    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and approach it just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting as needed. Here's how I would naturally think through solving the equation:\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Okay, the equation is \\(-x^2 = \\frac{3x + 1}{x + 3}\\).\n- At first glance, it looks like I have a quadratic term on one side and a rational expression on the other.\n- **Recalling Strategies:** This reminds me of problems where you set fractions equal to a quadratic, maybe clearing the denominator could help. Or perhaps bringing everything to one side to form a standard equation?\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- **Option 1:** Clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \\(x + 3\\).\n- **Option 2:** Bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n- **Option 3:** Check if factoring could simplify it later.\n\nI think starting by clearing the fraction makes sense because it could simplify the equation right away. But I\u2019ll also keep in mind that I might need to factor or use the quadratic formula later.\n\n**Decision:** Let\u2019s go with multiplying both sides by \\(x + 3\\) to eliminate the denominator.\n\n### **Step 2: Clearing the Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Action:** Multiply both sides by \\(x + 3\\) to remove the fraction.\n  \n  \\[\n  -x^2 \\cdot (x + 3) = \\frac{3x + 1}{x + 3} \\cdot (x + 3)\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplifying:** \n  \\[\n  -x^2(x + 3) = 3x + 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Expanded Form:**\n  \\[\n  -x^3 - 3x^2 = 3x + 1\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Did I distribute correctly? Yes, \\(-x^2 \\times x = -x^3\\) and \\(-x^2 \\times 3 = -3x^2\\).\n- **Reflection:** Seems correct so far. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n### **Step 3: Bringing All Terms to One Side**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Action:** To set the equation to zero, add \\(3x + 1\\) to both sides.\n  \n  \\[\n  -x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Rearranging:**\n  \\[\n  -x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  (Already in standard form)\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Is everything on one side? Yes, all terms are on the left side, and zero is on the right. Looks good.\n\n### **Step 4: Factoring the Polynomial**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Recalling Strategies:** Now, I need to solve the cubic equation \\(-x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1 = 0\\). Factoring might be tricky, but let\u2019s see if I can find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.\n- **Possible Roots:** According to the theorem, possible rational roots are factors of \\(-1\\) divided by factors of \\(-1\\): \\( \\pm 1\\).\n\n**Testing \\(x = -1\\):**\n\n- **Substitution:**\n  \\[\n  -(-1)^3 - 3(-1)^2 - 3(-1) - 1 = 1 - 3 + 3 - 1 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:** \\(x = -1\\) is a root.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, that\u2019s great!** I found \\(x = -1\\) is a root, which means \\((x + 1)\\) is a factor of the cubic equation. Let\u2019s use synthetic division to factor the polynomial.\n\n### **Step 5: Synthetic Division to Factor the Polynomial**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Action:** Use synthetic division to divide the cubic equation by \\((x + 1)\\).\n  \n- **Setup:**\n  \n  Coefficients: \\(-1, -3, -3, -1\\)\n  \n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n  -1 & -1 & -3 & -3 & -1 \\\\\n     &    & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n  \\hline\n     & -1 & -2 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Explanation:**\n  - Bring down the \\(-1\\).\n  - Multiply \\(-1\\) by \\(1\\) (next coefficient), add to \\(-3\\) \u2192 \\(-2\\).\n  - Multiply \\(-1\\) by \\(-2\\) \u2192 \\(2\\), add to \\(-3\\) \u2192 \\(-1\\).\n  - Multiply \\(-1\\) by \\(-1\\) \u2192 \\(1\\), add to \\(-1\\) \u2192 \\(0\\).\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n- **Resulting Polynomial:** \\(-1x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0\\)\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Reversing Steps:** Multiplying back, \\((x + 1)(-x^2 - 2x - 1) = -x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1\\) matches the original equation.\n\n### **Step 6: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Action:** Now, solve \\(-x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0\\).\n  \n- **Rearranging:**\n  \\[\n  x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0 \\quad \\text{(Multiplying by -1)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Recognizing a Perfect Square:**\n  \\[\n  (x + 1)^2 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solution:**\n  \\[\n  x + 1 = 0 \\implies x = -1\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a second\u2026** The quadratic equation gave me \\(x = -1\\) again. But I already found \\(x = -1\\) as a root during synthetic division. This indicates that \\(x = -1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\((x + 1)^2 = 0\\) make sense? Yes, it indicates that the root \\(x = -1\\) has a multiplicity of 2.\n\n### **Step 7: Identifying All Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Recalling:** From synthetic division, we factored the original equation into \\((x + 1)(-x^2 - 2x - 1) = 0\\).\n- **Factored Form:**\n  \\[\n  (x + 1)(x + 1)^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad (x + 1)^3 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solutions:**\n  \\[\n  x = -1 \\quad \\text{(with multiplicity 3)}\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\((x + 1)^3 = 0\\) yield \\(x = -1\\) as a triple root? Yes, it does.\n\n### **Step 8: Final Answer**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **All Solutions Identified:** The only solution is \\(x = -1\\), and it\u2019s a root of multiplicity 3.\n- **Reflection:** It\u2019s interesting that the original equation has a single repeated root. This can happen in cubic equations depending on how the factors combine.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\[\nx = -1\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThroughout this problem, I started by brainstorming different strategies to tackle the equation. Initially, I attempted to clear the fraction, which led me to a cubic equation. Recognizing \\(x = -1\\) as a root allowed me to factor the polynomial using synthetic division, revealing that \\(x = -1\\) is a repeated root. \n\n**Key Checks:**\n\n- After clearing the fraction, all terms were correctly set to zero.\n- Synthetic division confirmed \\(x = -1\\) as a root.\n- Solving the quadratic factor showed \\(x = -1\\) again, indicating it\u2019s a root with multiplicity 3.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, including reflecting and checking at each stage, ensured that the solution was accurate and complete.",

  "ground_truth": "Multiplying both sides by $x+3,$ we have $-x^2(x+3) = 3x+1,$ or $-x^3 - 3x^2 = 3x + 1.$ Thus, \\[x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0.\\]We recognize the left-hand side as the expansion of $(x+1)^3,$ so \\[(x+1)^3 = 0.\\]This forces $x+1=0,$ so $x = \\boxed{-1},$ which is the only solution."
