We'll explore various methods, adjust as needed, and ensure each step makes sense before moving forward. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Brainstorming**\n\n**First thoughts:**\n\nOkay, we're dealing with a right circular cone, which makes me think about the geometry formulas I know. The question involves finding the height of the cone given its volume and radius. I remember that the volume of a cone is linked to its radius and height, but I can't recall the exact formula at the moment. \n\nWhat I do know is:\n\n- **Cone Volume Formula:** V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n- The given volume is \\(30\\pi\\) cubic inches.\n- The radius \\(r\\) is 3 inches.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Yes, the radius is indeed 3 inches, and the volume is \\(30\\pi\\).\n\n**Possible strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Volume Formula Directly:** Plug in the given values into the volume formula and solve for \\(h\\).\n   \n2. **Rearrange the Formula:** Since I know the volume and radius, I could rearrange the formula to solve for height before plugging in numbers.\n   \n3. **Check Units and Simplify:** Make sure units are consistent and perhaps simplify \\(\u03c0\\) out early to make calculations easier.\n\nHmm, the first strategy seems straightforward\u2014using the volume formula directly. But let me think if there's an easier path. Maybe simplifying \\(\u03c0\\) out right away could make calculations cleaner. \n\n**Realization:** \n\nAfter considering these options, I think using the volume formula directly is the most straightforward approach. However, ensuring that \\(\u03c0\\) cancels out appropriately might simplify things. Let's proceed with the direct method first and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Volume Formula**\n\n**Thought process:**\n\nLet's use the volume formula for a cone:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nWe know:\n\n- \\(V = 30\\pi\\)\n- \\(r = 3\\) inches\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n30\\pi = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify the right side:\n\n\\[\n30\\pi = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times 9 \\times h\n\\]\n\n\\[\n30\\pi = 3\\pi h\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting on the calculation:**\n\nWait a minute, I see that \\(\u03c0\\) appears on both sides. Could I have simplified earlier? Let's check.\n\n**Check:**\n\nYes, \\(\u03c0\\) cancels out, making the equation much simpler:\n\n\\[\n30 = 3h\n\\]\n\nThis is straightforward. Solving for \\(h\\):\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{30}{3} = 10 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat seems too clean, doesn't it? But the math checks out. The height \\(h\\) is 10 inches. Let's proceed with this answer for now, but I'll double-check by plugging it back into the volume formula to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought process:**\n\nIt's always good to verify the solution by plugging the value back into the original formula to ensure it satisfies the volume condition.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's use the height we found (\\(h = 10\\) inches) and see if it gives the correct volume.\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nPlugging in \\(r = 3\\) and \\(h = 10\\):\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (3)^2 (10)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times 9 \\times 10\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times 90\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV = 30\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nYes, it matches the given volume exactly! So, our height calculation is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Checking if there\u2019s a more straightforward method:**\n\nNow that we've confirmed our initial approach works, let's see if there's a quicker way to arrive at the same answer.\n\n**Alternative strategy:**\n\n- **Rearrange the volume formula before plugging in numbers:**\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\implies h = \\frac{3V}{\\pi r^2}\n\\]\n\nWait, maybe I should simplify the formula first to see if it helps.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\(V = 30\\pi\\)\n- \\(r = 3\\)\n\nPlugging them into the rearranged formula:\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{3 \\times 30\\pi}{\\pi (3)^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{90\\pi}{\\pi \\times 9}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{90}{9} = 10 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, we arrived at the same height\u201410 inches. This confirms that our initial method was correct. However, rearranging the formula before plugging in numbers can sometimes make it easier to spot errors or simplify calculations, especially with more complicated values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought process:**\n\nIt's always good to do one last check to ensure everything aligns perfectly.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nUsing the original volume formula with all values:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (3)^2 (10) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times 9 \\times 10 = \\frac{90}{3} \\pi = 30\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out! The volume calculated with the height we found matches the given volume exactly. So, we're confident in our solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, applying the volume formula directly, and verifying the solution through multiple checkpoints, we've determined that the height of the cone needed to hold \\(30\\pi\\) cubic inches of water is **10 inches**. Throughout the process, reflecting and checking our work ensured accuracy and clarity, resembling a natural human problem-solving approach.",
