    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just as I would tackle it if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my progress, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's start by really understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, I see the equation:  \n\\[ 3000 + x - 2000 = 1500 + 1000 \\]\n\nAt first glance, this looks like an equation involving simple arithmetic with a variable \\( x \\). My initial thought is that it's a linear equation, and I need to solve for \\( x \\). It reminds me of balancing equations where both sides must be equal.\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n\n1. **Simplify Both Sides:** Maybe I can simplify each side of the equation to see if that reveals the value of \\( x \\).\n2. **Isolate \\( x \\):** Attempt to get \\( x \\) by itself on one side, similar to solving basic algebraic equations.\n3. **Plug and Chug:** Substitute different values for \\( x \\) to see which one makes the equation true, although this might be time-consuming.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI think simplifying both sides first makes the most sense. It should give me a clearer picture of what's happening with the equation. If that doesn't work, I can try isolating \\( x \\). Plugging in values could take too long, so I'll save that as a last resort.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify Both Sides**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s start by simplifying both sides of the equation to see if that helps. I\u2019ll combine like terms and see what I get.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[ 3000 + x - 2000 = 1500 + 1000 \\]  \n\\[ (3000 - 2000) + x = 1500 + 1000 \\]  \n\\[ 1000 + x = 2500 \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense?  \n- Left Side: \\( 1000 + x \\)  \n- Right Side: \\( 2500 \\)\n\nSo, it seems like \\( x \\) must be \\( 1500 \\) to make both sides equal. But let me double-check by substituting back into the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verify the Solution \\( x = 1500 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore concluding, I should verify whether substituting \\( x = 1500 \\) satisfies the original equation. This is important to ensure there were no mistakes in the simplification process.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 1500 \\) into the original equation:  \n\\[ 3000 + 1500 - 2000 = 1500 + 1000 \\]  \n\\[ 4500 - 2000 = 2500 \\]  \n\\[ 2500 = 2500 \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nBoth sides are equal, so \\( x = 1500 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe simplification worked perfectly, and the checks confirm that \\( x = 1500 \\) is correct. This approach was straightforward and efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Isolating \\( x \\) Directly**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEven though the first method worked well, let's explore another strategy by directly isolating \\( x \\) to see if we arrive at the same solution. Sometimes approaching from different angles reinforces the correctness of the answer.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nStarting from the simplified equation:  \n\\[ 1000 + x = 2500 \\]\n\nSubtract \\( 1000 \\) from both sides:  \n\\[ x = 2500 - 1000 \\]  \n\\[ x = 1500 \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nAgain, \\( x = 1500 \\). This matches our previous result.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth methods lead to the same solution, which is reassuring. It confirms that the initial approach was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring a Third Method: Plug and Chug**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlthough the previous methods were efficient, let's consider the \"plug and chug\" method, where we substitute different values for \\( x \\) to see which one satisfies the equation. This is more of a trial-and-error approach and can be time-consuming, but it's worth exploring to ensure our solution is robust.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's check a few values:\n\n1. **Try \\( x = 1000 \\):**  \n   \\[ 3000 + 1000 - 2000 = 1500 + 1000 \\]  \n   \\[ 4000 - 2000 = 2500 \\]  \n   \\[ 2000 \u2260 2500 \\] \u2192 Incorrect\n\n2. **Try \\( x = 1500 \\):**  \n   \\[ 3000 + 1500 - 2000 = 1500 + 1000 \\]  \n   \\[ 4500 - 2000 = 2500 \\]  \n   \\[ 2500 = 2500 \\] \u2192 Correct\n\n3. **Try \\( x = 2000 \\):**  \n   \\[ 3000 + 2000 - 2000 = 1500 + 1000 \\]  \n   \\[ 5000 - 2000 = 2500 \\]  \n   \\[ 3000 \u2260 2500 \\] \u2192 Incorrect\n\n**Check:**\n\nOnly \\( x = 1500 \\) satisfies the equation, confirming our earlier findings.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis method is less efficient than simplifying the equation directly, but it serves as a validation step. It shows that \\( x = 1500 \\) is the only value that makes the equation true.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThroughout the problem, starting with simplifying the equation was the most straightforward and effective approach. Verifying the solution ensured accuracy, and exploring alternative methods like isolating \\( x \\) and plugging in values reinforced the correctness of the answer. Although the \"plug and chug\" method was more time-consuming, it confirmed that no other values aside from \\( x = 1500 \\) satisfy the equation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe value of \\( x \\) that makes the equation true is  \n\\[ x = 1500 \\]\n\nBy approaching the problem step by step, checking each stage, and exploring multiple strategies, we've confidently arrived at the correct solution.",
