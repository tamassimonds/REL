    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle the problem **\"Express \\(0.1\\overline{7}\\) as a common fraction\"** step by step, reflecting and brainstorming as we go along. I'll write my thought process in a natural flow, exploring different strategies, checking as I progress, and adjusting my approach whenever necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so I need to convert the decimal \\(0.1\\overline{7}\\) into a common fraction. The notation \\(0.1\\overline{7}\\) suggests that after the initial 0.1, the digit 7 repeats indefinitely. \n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Recurring Decimals:** This looks like a recurring decimal problem similar to \\(0.\\overline{3}\\) or \\(0.142857\\overline{142857}\\).\n- **Strategies I Know:**\n  - Use algebraic equations to represent the repeating part.\n  - Perhaps there's a geometric series approach?\n  - Maybe I can separate the non-repeating and repeating parts and handle them differently.\n\nAt this moment, separating the non-repeating and repeating components seems like a good starting point. Let me jot down this initial strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Separating the Non-Repeating and Repeating Parts**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe decimal is \\(0.1\\overline{7}\\), meaning:\n- There's a non-repeating part: \\(0.1\\)\n- There's a repeating part: \\(0.0\\overline{7}\\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n\\[\n0.1\\overline{7} = 0.1 + 0.0\\overline{7}\n\\]\n\nThis makes sense because adding the two should give me the original decimal back.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so separating the parts feels intuitive. Addressing the non-repeating and repeating components individually might simplify the problem. But how do I convert \\(0.0\\overline{7}\\) into a fraction? \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Converting the Repeating Decimal \\(0.0\\overline{7}\\) into a Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI remember that converting repeating decimals into fractions usually involves setting up an equation. Let\u2019s apply that here.\n\n**Strategy: Using Algebraic Equations**\n\n1. **Let\u2019s Define the Decimal:**\n   \\[\n   x = 0.0\\overline{7}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply by 10 to Shift the Decimal Point:**\n   \\[\n   10x = 0.07\\overline{7}\n   \\]\n\n   By multiplying by 10, I\u2019m moving the decimal one place to the right.\n\n3. **Subtract the Original Equation from This New One:**\n   \\[\n   10x - x = 0.07\\overline{7} - 0.0\\overline{7}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9x = 0.07\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{0.07}{9}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a moment\u2014does this make sense? Let me check. If \\(0.0\\overline{7} = \\frac{0.07}{9}\\), then multiply back to see if it holds:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.07}{9} \\times 9 = 0.07\n\\]\n\nBut \\(0.0\\overline{7}\\) should repeat, so I might need to adjust. I think I need to reconsider how the decimal is set up. Let me brainstorm other approaches.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Fixing the Initial Step**\n\nHmm, the repeating part starts after the first digit. Maybe I need to set up the equation differently to capture the full repeating cycle starting from the first 7.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1. **Let\u2019s Define the Decimal Again:**\n   \\[\n   x = 0.1\\overline{7}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply by 10 to Shift Past the Non-Repeating Part:**\n   \\[\n   10x = 1.\\overline{7}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply by 10 Again to Capture the Repeats:**\n   \\[\n   100x = 10.\\overline{7}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the First Equation from This New One:**\n   \\[\n   100x - 10x = 10.\\overline{7} - 1.\\overline{7}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90x = 9\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so now I get \\(x = \\frac{1}{10}\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because \\(0.1\\overline{7}\\) should be greater than \\(0.1\\). Let me re-evaluate my steps.\n\n**Identifying the Mistake:**\n\nI think I might have mismanaged the transitions between equations. Let's properly account for the repeating segment without losing its value.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Correcting the Repeating Decimal Conversion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to ensure that the repeating part is accurately captured. Let\u2019s set up the equations more carefully.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1. **Define the Decimal Again:**\n   \\[\n   x = 0.1\\overline{7}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply by 10 to Shift Past the Non-Repeating Part:**\n   \\[\n   10x = 1.\\overline{7}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply by 10 Again to Bring Back the Decimal Point After One Repetition:**\n   \\[\n   100x = 17.\\overline{7}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the First Equation from This New One:**\n   \\[\n   100x - 10x = 17.\\overline{7} - 1.\\overline{7}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90x = 16\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{16}{90}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{8}{45}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, \\(x = \\frac{8}{45}\\). Let\u2019s check this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure that \\(0.1\\overline{7} = \\frac{8}{45}\\), let's convert \\(\\frac{8}{45}\\) back to a decimal and see if it matches.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{45} = 0.177777...\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\nDoes this match \\(0.1\\overline{7}\\)?\n\n\\[\n0.1\\overline{7} = 0.177777...\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nYes, they match! So, \\(\\frac{8}{45}\\) is indeed the correct fraction representation for \\(0.1\\overline{7}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:** Started by separating the non-repeating and repeating parts, which felt logical.\n- **Mistakes Identified:** Initially mismanaged the conversion of the repeating part by not accurately capturing the length and position of the repetition.\n- **Correct Approach:** Carefully setting up algebraic equations to handle both the non-repeating and repeating segments separately led to the correct fraction.\n- **Verification:** Converting \\(\\frac{8}{45}\\) back to a decimal confirmed the accuracy of the solution.\n\nThis problem required a bit of back-and-forth, reflecting on where things went wrong, and adjusting the approach to get it right. But by persistently checking and adapting the strategy, we arrived at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[0.1\\overline{7} = \\frac{8}{45}\\]\n\nFeel free to ask if there's anything else you'd like to explore or if another problem needs tackling!",
