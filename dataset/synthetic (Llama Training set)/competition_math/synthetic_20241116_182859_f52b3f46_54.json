I'll approach it step-by-step, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on whether they're correct, checking my work often, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's think through it like a human would, complete with messy thoughts, realizations, and maybe even a bit of confusion along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, **\u201cThe base six number \\(53_6\\) is equal to the base \\(b\\) number \\(113_b\\). What is the positive value of \\(b\\)?\u201d**, I think:\n\n- **Base Conversion:** This looks like a problem involving converting numbers between different bases. I remember that converting from one base to another requires understanding how to express numbers in different numeral systems.\n\n- **Equality of Numbers:** Since \\(53_6\\) and \\(113_b\\) are equal in value, I can set up an equation based on their conversions to a common base, probably base ten, to find \\(b\\).\n\n- **Need for Base \\(b\\) to be Greater than 6:** I'm recalling that a base \\(b\\) number can only include digits less than \\(b\\), so \\(b\\) must be greater than 6 to accommodate the digit '3' in \\(53_6\\).\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure where to start. Let me brainstorm a few strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Convert Both Numbers to Base Ten:**\n   - Convert \\(53_6\\) to base ten.\n   - Convert \\(113_b\\) to base ten (expressing \\(b\\) as an unknown).\n   - Set the two base ten values equal to each other.\n\n2. **Use the Relationship Between Bases:**\n   - Perhaps there's a formula or relationship between bases that can simplify the problem.\n\n3. **Trial and Error with Base Ten Conversions:**\n   - Try different values of \\(b\\) greater than 6 to see if the equality holds.\n\nHmm, strategy 1 seems the most straightforward: converting both numbers to base ten and setting them equal. Let\u2019s go with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Convert \\(53_6\\) to Base Ten**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to understand how to convert a number from base six to base ten. The positional values in base six are powers of six, starting from \\(6^0\\) on the right.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n53_6 = 5 \\times 6^1 + 3 \\times 6^0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 5 \\times 6 + 3 \\times 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 30 + 3 = 33_{10}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, so \\(53_6\\) is equal to \\(33\\) in base ten. That seems correct because \\(5 \\times 6\\) is 30, and adding 3 gives 33.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Convert \\(113_b\\) to Base Ten**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to convert \\(113_b\\) to base ten. The digit positions represent powers of \\(b\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n113_b = 1 \\times b^2 + 1 \\times b^1 + 3 \\times b^0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1 \\times b^2 + 1 \\times b + 3 \\times 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= b^2 + b + 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, \\(113_b\\) in base ten is \\(b^2 + b + 3\\). This makes sense as each digit is multiplied by its respective power of \\(b\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Set Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince the two numbers are equal in their respective bases, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n33_{10} = b^2 + b + 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis equation looks good because both sides represent the same value in base ten. Now, I need to solve for \\(b\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Rearrange the Equation**\n\n**Calculation:**\nBring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\nb^2 + b + 3 - 33 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb^2 + b - 30 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, simplifying the equation makes it easier to solve. Now, it looks like a standard quadratic equation. I can use factoring or the quadratic formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solve the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Strategy:**\nLet\u2019s try to factor the quadratic equation \\(b^2 + b - 30 = 0\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI'm looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-30\\) (the constant term) and add up to \\(1\\) (the coefficient of \\(b\\)).\n\n**Possible Factors:**\n- \\(-3\\) and \\(10\\)\n- \\(3\\) and \\(-10\\)\n- \\(-5\\) and \\(6\\)\n- \\(5\\) and \\(-6\\)\n\n**Checking:**\n\\[\n(-5) \\times 6 = -30 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (-5) + 6 = 1\n\\]\nPerfect!\n\n**Calculation:**\nSo, the equation factors to:\n\n\\[\n(b - 5)(b + 6) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(b\\):**\n\\[\nb - 5 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 5\n\\]\n\\[\nb + 6 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = -6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nI have two possible solutions: \\(b = 5\\) and \\(b = -6\\). But wait, the problem asks for the positive value of \\(b\\), so the only valid solution is \\(b = 5\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Check the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let me check if \\(b = 5\\) makes both numbers equal in their respective bases.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Convert \\(113_5\\) to Base Ten:**\n   \\[\n   113_5 = 1 \\times 5^2 + 1 \\times 5^1 + 3 \\times 5^0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 1 \\times 25 + 1 \\times 5 + 3 \\times 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 25 + 5 + 3 = 33_{10}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Comparison:**\n   Both \\(53_6\\) and \\(113_5\\) converted to base ten equal \\(33\\). This confirms that \\(b = 5\\) is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe solution checks out. Both numbers are equal when converted to base ten with \\(b = 5\\). Any other approach would likely lead to more complex calculations or trial and error, making this method the most efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAfter exploring different strategies, solving the quadratic equation, and verifying the solution, I\u2019m confident that the positive value of \\(b\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis step-by-step approach\u2014starting with base conversions, setting up and solving an equation, and finally checking the solution\u2014ensured accuracy. By brainstorming different methods and reflecting on each step, I avoided potential pitfalls and confirmed the validity of the answer.",
