    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking through various strategies, reflecting often, and checking our work along the way. I'll start by brainstorming different approaches, see which one feels right, and adjust as needed. Let's treat this like a human would tackle a problem \u2014 exploring, getting sometimes sidetracked, realizing when something doesn't work, and adjusting the path accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about a geometric series: \n\n\\[4+\\frac{12}{a}+\\frac{36}{a^2}+\\cdots\\]\n\nAnd we need to find the smallest positive integer value of \\(a\\) such that the sum of this series is a perfect square.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Geometric Series:** I remember that geometric series have a common ratio between terms. Maybe I can identify that here.\n  \n- **Sum of the Series:** The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is familiar to me. I think I can use that to find the total sum in terms of \\(a\\).\n  \n- **Perfect Square Condition:** This is interesting. I need the sum to be a perfect square, so I'll have to consider how the value of \\(a\\) affects that.\n\n- **Finding \\(a\\):** Since \\(a\\) must be a positive integer, I might have to test a few values to see which one makes the sum a perfect square.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Identify the Common Ratio:** First, see if I can determine the common ratio of the series. This seems essential because the sum formula depends on it.\n\n2. **Apply the Infinite Geometric Series Sum Formula:** Once I have the common ratio, I can apply the formula to find the sum in terms of \\(a\\).\n\n3. **Set the Sum to Be a Perfect Square:** After finding the sum, I'll set it equal to a perfect square and solve for \\(a\\).\n\n4. **Check Integer Constraints:** Ensure that the solution for \\(a\\) is a positive integer.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n\n- **Or Maybe There's a Simpler Way:** Perhaps there's a more straightforward method to find \\(a\\) without going through the entire sum calculation.\n  \n- **Checking Multiple Strategies:** I might need to try different approaches if the first one seems too complex or doesn't lead to a clear solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying the Common Ratio**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me start by examining the series terms: \n\\[4, \\frac{12}{a}, \\frac{36}{a^2}, \\ldots\\]\n\nI recall that in a geometric series, each term is multiplied by a constant (the common ratio) to get the next term.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **First Term:** \\(4\\)\n- **Second Term:** \\(\\frac{12}{a}\\)\n  \n  To find the common ratio \\(r\\), I can divide the second term by the first term:\n  \n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{\\frac{12}{a}}{4} = \\frac{12}{4a} = \\frac{3}{a}\n  \\]\n  \n  So, the common ratio \\(r = \\frac{3}{a}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, dividing the second term by the first gives me a ratio that depends on \\(a\\), which is what I expect in a geometric series.\n\n**Check:**\n\nI can quickly check by looking at the ratio between the second and third terms:\n  \n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\frac{36}{a^2}}{\\frac{12}{a}} = \\frac{36}{12} \\times \\frac{a}{a^2} = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{3}{a}\n\\]\n  \nLooks consistent. The common ratio is indeed \\(\\frac{3}{a}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Infinite Geometric Series Sum Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I know the common ratio, I can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a_1}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(S\\) is the sum,\n- \\(a_1\\) is the first term,\n- \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **First Term (\\(a_1\\)):** \\(4\\)\n- **Common Ratio (\\(r\\)):** \\(\\frac{3}{a}\\)\n\nPlugging these into the sum formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{4}{1 - \\frac{3}{a}} = \\frac{4}{\\frac{a - 3}{a}} = \\frac{4a}{a - 3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, does the formula look right? At first glance, yes, but let me double-check the steps.\n\n**Check:**\n\nRevisiting the formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a_1}{1 - r} = \\frac{4}{1 - \\frac{3}{a}} = \\frac{4}{\\frac{a - 3}{a}} = 4 \\times \\frac{a}{a - 3} = \\frac{4a}{a - 3}\n\\]\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting the Sum to Be a Perfect Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum \\(S\\) must be a perfect square. I need to set up an equation where \\(\\frac{4a}{a - 3}\\) is a perfect square.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet\u2019s set \\(S = k^2\\), where \\(k\\) is some integer:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4a}{a - 3} = k^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis equation needs to be solved for \\(a\\). To make it easier, I'll multiply both sides by \\(a - 3\\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n4a = k^2 (a - 3)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4a = k^2a - 3k^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4a - k^2a = -3k^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\na(4 - k^2) = -3k^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-3k^2}{4 - k^2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, letting \\(a\\) be negative doesn't make sense here since \\(a\\) must be a positive integer. So, I need to ensure that \\(\\frac{-3k^2}{4 - k^2}\\) results in a positive integer.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nHmm, and \\(4 - k^2\\) must divide \\(-3k^2\\) without leaving a fraction. This condition will help in finding suitable \\(k\\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Analyzing the Equation \\(a = \\frac{-3k^2}{4 - k^2}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s think about the constraints here:\n\n- \\(a\\) must be a positive integer.\n- The denominator \\(4 - k^2\\) should be a factor of \\(-3k^2\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nRearranging the equation for \\(a\\):\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-3k^2}{4 - k^2}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(a\\) to be positive, \\(\\frac{-3k^2}{4 - k^2}\\) must be positive, meaning:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-3k^2}{4 - k^2} > 0\n\\]\n\nThis inequality will help determine valid \\(k\\) values.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet\u2019s analyze this:\n\n- If \\(k^2 < 4\\), then \\(4 - k^2 > 0\\), making the denominator positive.\n- Since \\(k^2\\) is positive (\\(k\\) is an integer), \\(-3k^2\\) is negative, and dividing by a positive number will yield a negative \\(a\\).\n\n**Realization:**\n\nThis situation doesn't work because \\(a\\) must be positive. So, perhaps \\(k^2 > 4\\) is necessary to make the denominator negative, resulting in a positive \\(a\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nBut when \\(k^2 > 4\\), does \\(4 - k^2\\) divide \\(-3k^2\\) nicely? Let me think this through:\n\n- For example, if \\(k^2 = 9\\), then \\(4 - 9 = -5\\), and:\n  \n  \\[\n  a = \\frac{-3 \\times 9}{-5} = \\frac{27}{5} = 5.4\n  \\]\n  \n  But \\(a\\) needs to be an integer, so \\(k^2\\) needs to be such that \\(\\frac{-3k^2}{4 - k^2}\\) results in an integer.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nThis is becoming tricky. Let me see if there\u2019s a different approach that might simplify things.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Seeking a Different Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe instead of solving for \\(a\\) directly, I can look for \\(k\\) values that satisfy the condition and then calculate \\(a\\).\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\n- Consider that \\(a\\) must be a positive integer.\n- Look for integer values of \\(k\\) such that \\(a\\) also becomes a positive integer.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet\u2019s start guessing integer values for \\(k\\) and see if \\(a\\) comes out to be a positive integer.\n\n**Guessing \\(k = 3\\):**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-3 \\times 3^2}{4 - 3^2} = \\frac{-3 \\times 9}{4 - 9} = \\frac{-27}{-5} = 5.4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nStill not an integer. Maybe \\(k = 5\\) would work?\n\n**Guessing \\(k = 5\\):**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-3 \\times 5^2}{4 - 5^2} = \\frac{-3 \\times 25}{4 - 25} = \\frac{-75}{-21} = 3.571\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nStill not an integer. Hmm, it seems that guessing \\(k\\) is not leading to integer values of \\(a\\).\n\n**Realization:**\n\nPerhaps I need to re-evaluate whether this approach is effective or if there's a better way.\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs there a mistake in my reasoning? Wait, maybe \\(k\\) needs to be larger, or perhaps the values I'm picking aren't suitable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Trying \\(k^2 = 16\\) (i.e., \\(k = \\pm 4\\))**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s pick \\(k = 4\\) since \\(k^2 = 16\\) and see if that works.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-3 \\times 4^2}{4 - 4^2} = \\frac{-3 \\times 16}{4 - 16} = \\frac{-48}{-12} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, \\(a = 4\\), which is a positive integer. Let\u2019s see if the sum \\(S\\) with \\(a = 4\\) is a perfect square.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nRe-calculate the sum \\(S\\) with \\(a = 4\\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{4 \\times 4}{4 - 3} = \\frac{16}{1} = 16\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the sum \\(S = 16\\), which is \\(4^2\\), a perfect square. It looks like \\(a = 4\\) is indeed the correct answer.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes everything align? Yes, \\(k = 4\\) leads to \\(a = 4\\), and the sum is a perfect square.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying \\(a = 4\\) as the Smallest Possible Value**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore concluding, let\u2019s ensure that \\(a = 4\\) is indeed the smallest possible positive integer value satisfying the condition.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nRecall the equation:\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-3k^2}{4 - k^2}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(a\\) must be a positive integer, and \\(k\\) is an integer, we need to check if there are any smaller \\(a\\) values possible.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFrom the earlier steps, attempting \\(k = 1, 2, 3\\) resulted in non-integer or negative \\(a\\) values. The next integer \\(k\\) is 4, which yields \\(a = 4\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, could there be another \\(k > 4\\) that leads to \\(a < 4\\)? Let\u2019s consider \\(k = 5\\):\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-3 \\times 5^2}{4 - 5^2} = \\frac{-75}{-21} = 3.571\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nBut \\(a = 3.571\\), which is not an integer. Hence, \\(k = 5\\) doesn\u2019t provide a valid integer \\(a\\).\n\n**Realization:**\n\nIt seems that \\(k = 4\\) leading to \\(a = 4\\) is indeed the smallest possible solution.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nTo be absolutely certain, let's briefly revisit the entire process:\n\n1. **Identified the Common Ratio:** \\(r = \\frac{3}{a}\\)\n2. **Applied the Sum Formula:** \\(S = \\frac{4a}{a - 3}\\)\n3. **Set the Sum as a Perfect Square:** \\(\\frac{4a}{a - 3} = k^2\\)\n4. **Solved for \\(a\\):** \\(a = \\frac{-3k^2}{4 - k^2}\\)\n5. **Tested \\(k = 4\\):** Yielded \\(a = 4\\), and the sum \\(S = 16\\), a perfect square.\n\nEverything checks out, and there are no smaller \\(a\\) values that satisfy the conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming and exploring various strategies, we determined that the smallest possible value of \\(a\\) is **4**. This was verified by ensuring that with \\(a = 4\\), the sum of the series is indeed a perfect square (\\(16\\)).",

We want $\\frac{4a}{a-3}$ to be a perfect square $b^2$, where $b$ is a positive integer. So we have $4a=b^2(a-3)$ and start trying values for $b$ until we get a positive integer $a$.\nIf $b=1$, then $4a=a-3$, but that means $a=-1$.\nIf $b=2$, then $4a=4(a-3)\\qquad\\Rightarrow 0=-12$.\nIf $b=3$, then $4a=9(a-3)\\qquad\\Rightarrow -5a=-27$, which doesn't yield an integer value for $a$.\nIf $b=4$, then $4a=16(a-3)\\qquad\\Rightarrow -12a=-48$, so $a=\\boxed{4}$, which is a positive integer.\n\nOR\n\nFor an infinite geometric series to converge, the common ratio must be between $-1$ and $1$.
