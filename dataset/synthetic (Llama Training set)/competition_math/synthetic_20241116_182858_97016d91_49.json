    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through it step by step, reflecting and checking my work along the way to ensure I'm heading in the right direction. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll tackle it:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst off, I need to **understand what the problem is asking**. The question is:\n\n\\[ \\lfloor |-4.2| \\rfloor + |\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor| \\]\n\n- **Thoughts:** \n  - **Floor Function (\\(\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor\\))**: I remember that the floor function returns the **greatest integer less than or equal to a given number**.\n  - **Absolute Value (\\(| \\cdot |\\))**: This function returns the **non-negative value** of a number, stripping away any negative sign.\n  - **Combining These**: The expression involves both absolute values and floor functions, which are **ordered sequentially**.\n\nSo, at a glance, it seems I need to evaluate the absolute value first, then apply the floor function, and finally add that result to the absolute value of the floor function applied to the negative number.\n\n### **2. Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** **Evaluate Inside Out**\n  - Start with the **innermost operations**: absolute value and floor function.\n  \n- **Strategy 2:** **Simplify Step by Step**\n  - Break down the expression into **smaller, manageable parts** and simplify each part before proceeding.\n\n- **Strategy 3:** **Check with Negative and Positive Examples**\n  - Maybe think about how these functions behave with **different types of numbers** (e.g., negative, positive, integers, non-integers).\n\n**Reflection:** I think Strategy 1\u2014evaluating inside out\u2014makes the most sense because it follows the natural order of operations. But I'll keep Strategy 2 in mind if I get stuck.\n\n### **3. Starting with Strategy 1: Evaluating Inside Out**\n\n#### **Step 1: Compute \\(|-4.2|\\)**\n\n- **Thoughts:** \n  - The absolute value of \\(-4.2\\) should return a **positive number**, right?\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  |-4.2| = 4.2\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** \n  - **Quick Check:** Yes, taking away the negative sign makes it \\(4.2\\). That seems correct.\n\n#### **Step 2: Apply Floor Function to 4.2**\n\n- **Thoughts:** \n  - Now, I need to find \\(\\lfloor 4.2 \\rfloor\\). The floor function should give me the **greatest integer less than or equal to 4.2**.\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\lfloor 4.2 \\rfloor = 4\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** \n  - **Quick Check:** \\(4\\) is indeed the greatest integer less than \\(4.2\\). This looks good.\n\n#### **Step 3: Compute \\(\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor\\)**\n\n- **Thoughts:** \n  - Wait, I need the floor of the **negative number**. So, \\(\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor\\) is looking for the **greatest integer less than or equal to -4.2**.\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor = -5\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** \n  - **Quick Check:** Is \\(-5\\) the greatest integer less than \\(-4.2\\)? Yes, because \\(-4\\) is greater than \\(-4.2\\), so \\(-5\\) makes sense.\n\n#### **Step 4: Compute \\(|\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor|\\)**\n\n- **Thoughts:** \n  - Now, take the absolute value of \\(-5\\).\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  |-5| = 5\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** \n  - **Quick Check:** Turning \\(-5\\) into a positive number gives \\(5\\). That\u2019s correct.\n\n### **4. Combining the Results**\n\n#### **Step 5: Add the Two Results Together**\n\n- **Expression Now:**\n  \\[\n  \\lfloor |-4.2| \\rfloor + |\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor| = 4 + 5\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  4 + 5 = 9\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Feeling Good About This:** All steps seem logical, and each part checks out. The addition is straightforward.\n\n### **5. Final Check**\n\n- **Thoughts:** \n  - Let me quickly review each step to ensure everything lines up correctly.\n  \n- **Review:**\n  - \\(|-4.2| = 4.2\\) **\u2714\ufe0f**\n  - \\(\\lfloor 4.2 \\rfloor = 4\\) **\u2714\ufe0f**\n  - \\(\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor = -5\\) **\u2714\ufe0f**\n  - \\(|\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor| = 5\\) **\u2714\ufe0f**\n  - \\(4 + 5 = 9\\) **\u2714\ufe0f**\n\n- **Conclusion:** \n  - The final answer is \\(9\\). Everything checks out, and the approach feels correct.\n\n### **6. Alternative Strategy: Simplifying Step by Step**\n\n- **Thoughts:** \n  - Maybe I can verify my answer by considering another approach\u2014simplifying parts separately before combining them.\n  \n- **Applying Strategy 2:**\n  - **Compute \\(|-4.2|\\)** \u2192 \\(4.2\\)\n  - **Then, \\(\\lfloor 4.2 \\rfloor\\)** \u2192 \\(4\\)\n  - **Next, \\(\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor\\)** \u2192 \\(-5\\)\n  - **Then, \\(|\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor|\\)** \u2192 \\(5\\)\n  - **Finally, add them together:** \\(4 + 5 = 9\\)\n\n- **Check:** \n  - **Same Result:** Using a different approach confirms that the answer is indeed \\(9\\).\n\n### **7. Final Reflection**\n\n- **Thoughts:** \n  - Both strategies lead to the same result, which adds confidence to the correctness of the answer.\n  - **Mistakes to Avoid:** Initially, I might have underestimated the impact of the negative floor function, but reflecting on each step ensured accuracy.\n\n- **Conclusion:** \n  - The final answer is confidently \\(9\\). Exploring different strategies and constantly checking along the way helped solidify the correctness.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, by methodically evaluating each component of the expression and verifying each step, I arrived at the correct answer. Reflecting and brainstorming alternate strategies ensured that I didn't miss any details or make errors along the way.",
