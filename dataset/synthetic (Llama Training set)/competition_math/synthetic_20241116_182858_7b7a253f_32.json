    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and approach it just like I would when tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work as I go, and adjust my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**\"Find the fifth term of the geometric sequence with first term \\(2\\) and second term \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\"**\n\nHmm, this looks like a problem involving geometric sequences. I remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Common Ratio (\\(r\\)):** \n   - Since I know the first and second terms, I can find \\(r\\) by dividing the second term by the first term.\n   \n2. **Use the Formula for \\(n\\)-th Term:**\n   - Once I have \\(r\\), I can use the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of a geometric sequence to find the fifth term.\n   \n3. **Check Consistency:**\n   - After calculating, I should check if the numbers make sense (e.g., \\(r\\) should be consistent between the terms).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- I think the first step should definitely be finding the common ratio \\(r\\). From there, using the \\(n\\)-th term formula seems straightforward.\n- But wait, let me consider if there's another way... Maybe I could list a few terms manually to see the pattern? However, that might be prone to error for the fifth term.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Calculating \\(r\\) and then using the \\(n\\)-th term formula sounds like the most reliable method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Common Ratio (\\(r\\))**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to find the common ratio \\(r\\) that connects the first and second terms.\n- From the definition of a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by \\(r\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\text{Second term}}{\\text{First term}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, the common ratio \\(r\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n- Let me quickly check: \\(2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\\). Yep, that aligns with the second term given.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- The calculation seems correct. Multiplying by \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) makes sense to go from \\(2\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Use the Formula for the \\(n\\)-th Term**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now that I have \\(r = \\frac{1}{8}\\), I can use the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of a geometric sequence:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 \\times r^{(n-1)}\n\\]\n\n- Here, \\(a_1 = 2\\), \\(r = \\frac{1}{8}\\), and I want to find \\(a_5\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\na_5 = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{(5-1)} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^4\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\na_5 = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{8^4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\na_5 = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{4096}\n\\]\n\n\\[\na_5 = \\frac{2}{4096}\n\\]\n\n\\[\na_5 = \\frac{1}{2048}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The fifth term \\(a_5\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2048}\\).\n- Let me pause and think: Does this result make sense? \n\n**Check for Reasonableness:**\n- We're dealing with a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n- Starting from \\(2\\), after multiple steps, ending up with \\(\\frac{1}{2048}\\) seems reasonable.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Just to double-check: \\(8^4 = 4096\\), and dividing \\(2\\) by \\(4096\\) gives \\(\\frac{1}{2048}\\). Calculation looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Calculation by Re-expressing the Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Sometimes it's helpful to re-express the formula or break down the calculation differently to ensure accuracy.\n- Let's see if there's another way to calculate \\(a_5\\) that confirms our previous result.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\n- Instead of calculating \\(r^4\\) directly, I can calculate each term step-by-step until the fifth term.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{First term } (a_1) = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Second term } (a_2) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Third term } (a_3) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{32}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fourth term } (a_4) = \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{256}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fifth term } (a_5) = \\frac{1}{256} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{2048}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This step-by-step approach also gives us \\(a_5 = \\frac{1}{2048}\\).\n- It matches our earlier calculation, confirming its correctness.\n\n**Check for Consistency:**\n- Both methods yield the same fifth term. This consistency reassures me that the calculation is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- After exploring different strategies\u2014first calculating the common ratio and using the \\(n\\)-th term formula, and then verifying by computing each term step-by-step\u2014I've confirmed that the fifth term of the sequence is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{2048}\\).\n- Throughout the process, I checked intermediate steps to ensure accuracy and reflected on whether the result made sense, which helped catch any potential errors early.\n- Engaging in these checks and considering alternative methods provided confidence in the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe fifth term of the geometric sequence is \\(\\frac{1}{2048}\\).",
