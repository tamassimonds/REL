    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Honestly, when I first look at it, I see that it's about finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) between a polynomial expression and a multiple of a specific number. GCD with polynomials? That reminds me of using the Euclidean algorithm, which I think I've used before with numbers. \n\nBut wait, I need to be sure that this polynomial GCD concept is similar to the numeric one. Hmm... let me brainstorm different strategies to tackle this.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- The problem states that \\( a \\) is a multiple of \\( 456 \\).\n- We need to find the GCD of \\( 3a^3 + a^2 + 4a + 57 \\) and \\( a \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- GCD typically deals with integers, but here we're involving variables and polynomials. That makes me think the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials might come into play.\n- Also, since \\( a \\) is a multiple of \\( 456 \\), maybe substituting \\( a = 456k \\) (where \\( k \\) is some integer) could simplify things? But I'm not sure if that's the best route.\n\n**Exploration:**\n1. **Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomials:**\n   - This is used to find the GCD of two polynomials by dividing and taking remainders, similar to the numeric Euclidean algorithm.\n   \n2. **Substituting \\( a \\):**\n   - Replacing \\( a \\) with \\( 456k \\) might simplify the expression, but I'm not certain if it directly helps in finding the GCD with \\( a \\).\n\n3. **Factoring Out \\( a \\):**\n   - Maybe factoring \\( a \\) out of the polynomial could reveal common factors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Let's start by trying to factor out \\( a \\) from the polynomial. If that doesn't work, maybe I'll consider substituting or applying the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Step 2: Attempting to Factor Out \\( a \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I\u2019ll look at the polynomial \\( 3a^3 + a^2 + 4a + 57 \\) and see if \\( a \\) can be factored out.\n  \n**Calculation:**\n- Factoring \\( a \\) would give me: \n  \\[\n  a(3a^2 + a + 4) + 57\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- Wait a minute, I can't factor \\( a \\) out perfectly because of the \\( +57 \\) at the end. So, factoring \\( a \\) doesn't seem to help here.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this make sense? No, because factored out, I still have a constant term \\( +57 \\) that doesn't involve \\( a \\). So maybe this approach isn't helpful.\n\n**Move On:**\n- Factoring out \\( a \\) doesn\u2019t work. Let\u2019s try another method.\n\n### Step 3: Considering the Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomials\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The Euclidean algorithm for numbers involves finding the GCD by dividing and taking remainders. Can I apply a similar concept to polynomials?\n\n**Exploration:**\n- I need to divide the polynomial \\( 3a^3 + a^2 + 4a + 57 \\) by \\( a \\) and see what the remainder is.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Performing polynomial division:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3a^3 + a^2 + 4a + 57}{a} = 3a^2 + 1 + \\frac{4a + 57}{a}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- So, the quotient is \\( 3a^2 + 1 \\) and the remainder is \\( \\frac{4a + 57}{a} \\). But wait, remainders in the Euclidean algorithm are usually polynomials with degrees lower than the divisor. Here, \\( \\frac{4a + 57}{a} \\) simplifies to \\( 4 + \\frac{57}{a} \\), which involves \\( a \\).\n\n**Check:**\n- This doesn't seem right because we\u2019re left with a term \\( \\frac{57}{a} \\), and since \\( a \\) is a multiple of \\( 456 \\), this term becomes a fraction involving \\( a \\). Is that acceptable in finding GCD? Hmm... I'm not sure if this aligns with standard GCD definitions.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Maybe dividing by \\( a \\) isn't the best approach because it introduces fractions and complicates things. Perhaps I need a different strategy.\n\n**Move On:**\n- Since dividing by \\( a \\) leads to complications, let\u2019s try substituting \\( a = 456k \\) to see if that simplifies the problem.\n\n### Step 4: Trying Substituting \\( a = 456k \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Substituting \\( a = 456k \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer might simplify the expression. But I need to see if it helps in finding the GCD.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Substitute into the polynomial:\n  \\[\n  3(456k)^3 + (456k)^2 + 4(456k) + 57\n  \\]\n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 456^3 k^3 + 456^2 k^2 + 4 \\times 456 k + 57\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- This results in a very large polynomial involving \\( k \\). It seems like overcomplicating the problem, especially since we're dealing with GCD, which should ideally remain in terms of \\( a \\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this make sense? No, substituting \\( a \\) makes the expression too complex and doesn't directly help in finding the GCD with \\( a \\).\n\n**Realization:**\n- Substituting \\( a \\) makes things messier. Maybe it's better to stick with the original expression and try another approach.\n\n**Move On:**\n- Since substitution doesn\u2019t simplify the problem, let\u2019s consider another method: factoring the polynomial \\( 3a^3 + a^2 + 4a + 57 \\) to see if any common factors with \\( a \\) emerge.\n\n### Step 5: Attempting to Factor the Polynomial\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Perhaps factoring the entire polynomial might reveal common factors with \\( a \\).\n\n**Exploration:**\n- Looking for possible factoring techniques like grouping or recognizing patterns.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Trying to factor by grouping:\n  \\[\n  (3a^3 + a^2) + (4a + 57) = a^2(3a + 1) + (4a + 57)\n  \\]\n  \n  This doesn't seem to lead to a clean factorization, so perhaps another approach is needed.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Factoring the polynomial completely is challenging and doesn't seem to yield immediate insights about the GCD with \\( a \\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Is this helping? No, because factoring doesn't reveal common factors. It might be a dead end.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Factoring isn't providing clarity. Let's pivot to another strategy.\n\n**Move On:**\n- Since factoring isn't working, I'll consider leveraging the properties of GCD involving multiple and polynomial expressions.\n\n### Step 6: Leveraging GCD Properties\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- If \\( a \\) is a multiple of \\( 456 \\), and we want the GCD of \\( a \\) and the polynomial, perhaps reducing the polynomial modulo \\( a \\) could help.\n\n**Exploration:**\n- Reducing the polynomial modulo \\( a \\) means substituting \\( a \\) with \\( 0 \\) in the polynomial to see what's left.\n  \n**Calculation:**\n- Setting \\( a = 0 \\) in the polynomial:\n  \\[\n  3(0)^3 + (0)^2 + 4(0) + 57 = 57\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- So, the polynomial reduces to \\( 57 \\) when \\( a = 0 \\). \n\n**Check:**\n- Does this make sense? Yes, because if \\( a \\) divides the polynomial \\( 57 \\), then the GCD should be \\( 57 \\).\n\n**Realization:**\n- This indicates that \\( 57 \\) is a common divisor. Since we're looking for the greatest common divisor, \\( 57 \\) is likely the answer.\n\n**Move On:**\n- Given this realization, let's confirm if \\( 57 \\) is indeed the GCD by considering \\( 57 \\) as a factor of \\( a \\).\n\n### Step 7: Confirming \\( 57 \\) as a Factor of \\( a \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since \\( a \\) is a multiple of \\( 456 \\), and we suspect \\( 57 \\) to be the GCD, let's check if \\( 57 \\) divides \\( 456 \\).\n  \n**Calculation:**\n- Dividing \\( 456 \\) by \\( 57 \\):\n  \\[\n  456 \u00f7 57 = 8\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- This shows that \\( 57 \\) divides \\( 456 \\), meaning \\( a \\) being a multiple of \\( 456 \\) implies \\( a \\) is also a multiple of \\( 57 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this validate our earlier step? Yes, because if \\( a \\) is a multiple of \\( 57 \\), and reducing the polynomial modulo \\( a \\) gave \\( 57 \\), it confirms \\( 57 \\) is indeed the GCD.\n\n**Realization:**\n- This consistency reassures that \\( 57 \\) is the correct GCD.\n\n**Move On:**\n- Given the checks, let's finalize \\( 57 \\) as the GCD.\n\n### Step 8: Final Confirmation\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To ensure correctness, let's consider the polynomial \\( 3a^3 + a^2 + 4a + 57 \\) and see if substituting \\( a = 456k \\) aligns with our GCD finding.\n\n**Exploration:**\n- Substitute \\( a = 456k \\) into the polynomial:\n  \\[\n  3(456k)^3 + (456k)^2 + 4(456k) + 57\n  \\]\n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 456^3 k^3 + 456^2 k^2 + 4 \\times 456 k + 57\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- The resulting expression is indeed a multiple of \\( 57 \\) because each term involving \\( 456 \\) (which is \\( 456 = 57 \\times 8 \\)) is multiplied by \\( 57 \\), and the constant \\( 57 \\) remains.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this align with our earlier conclusion? Yes, because whether \\( a \\) is \\( 456k \\) or just \\( 456 \\), the polynomial remains divisible by \\( 57 \\).\n\n**Realization:**\n- This reinforces that \\( 57 \\) is the GCD, as every multiple of \\( a \\) (being \\( 456 \\)) also includes \\( 57 \\) as a factor.\n\n**Move On:**\n- With multiple confirmations, it's clear that the GCD is \\( 57 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n**Expression:**\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(3a^3 + a^2 + 4a + 57, a) = 57\n\\]\n\n**Explanation:**\n- By reducing the polynomial modulo \\( a \\), we found that the remainder is \\( 57 \\).\n- Since \\( a \\) is a multiple of \\( 456 \\) and \\( 57 \\) divides \\( 456 \\), \\( 57 \\) is a common divisor of both \\( a \\) and the polynomial.\n- Thus, the greatest common divisor is \\( 57 \\).\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n- Initially, I considered multiple strategies: factoring \\( a \\) out, using the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials, and substituting \\( a = 456k \\). \n- Factoring didn't work due to constant terms, and substitution made things overly complicated.\n- Ultimately, reducing the polynomial modulo \\( a \\) provided a straightforward path to the solution.\n- Throughout, checking the divisibility of \\( 456 \\) by \\( 57 \\) solidified the correctness of \\( 57 \\) as the GCD.\n- It's essential to explore different approaches and verify each step to ensure the accuracy of the final answer.",
