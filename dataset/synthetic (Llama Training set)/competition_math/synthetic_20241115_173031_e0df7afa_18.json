That makes me think about the properties of numbers and their divisors. I recall that the number of positive divisors is related to the prime factorization of the number.\n\n- **Find the Number of Positive Divisors of \\(8n^3\\):** Okay, we're dealing with \\(n^3\\), and then multiplying by 8. The exponent rules and properties of divisors come to mind here.\n\n- **User Query:** I want to find the number of positive divisors of this new expression, \\(8n^3\\).\n\nAt this point, I'm feeling like I need to revisit how divisor counts work, especially in relation to prime factorization. Let's explore different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Approach:**\n   - I could start by determining the prime factorization of \\(n\\). If \\(n\\) has exactly 11 divisors, there must be a specific form to its prime factors.\n   - Once I know \\(n\\), I can find \\(n^3\\), then include 8 (which is \\(2^3\\)), and then determine the total number of divisors.\n\n2. **Using Divisor Function Properties:**\n   - Recall that for a number \\(m = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}\\), the number of divisors \\(d(m) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\\).\n   - This property is crucial because it ties back to how \\(n\\) is structured.\n\n3. **Exploring Patterns with Small Numbers:**\n   - Maybe test with small odd integers having 11 divisors to see if a pattern emerges.\n   - This might help validate the theoretical approach.\n\nI'll start with the **Prime Factorization Approach**, as knowing the structure of \\(n\\) will directly lead to finding the divisors of \\(8n^3\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization of \\(n\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I know that the number of divisors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization.\n- If \\(n\\) has exactly 11 divisors, and 11 is a prime number, then the structure of \\(n\\) must be such that the divisor count formula results in 11.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- The divisor count formula is \\(d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\\).\n- Since 11 is prime, the only way to achieve this is if \\(n\\) is of the form:\n  \\[\n  n = p^{10}\n  \\]\n  where \\(p\\) is a prime number. This is because:\n  \\[\n  e_1 + 1 = 11 \\implies e_1 = 10\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, so \\(n\\) must be a prime raised to the 10th power? That feels solid because \\(p^{10}\\) would have exactly 11 divisors:\n  \\[\n  e_1 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\n  \\]\n- This aligns with the given condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Express \\(8n^3\\) in Terms of Prime Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I know \\(n = p^{10}\\), I can substitute this into \\(8n^3\\).\n- I need to express everything in terms of primes to easily determine the number of divisors.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Start by finding \\(n^3\\):\n  \\[\n  n^3 = (p^{10})^3 = p^{30}\n  \\]\n  \n- Now, multiply by 8:\n  \\[\n  8n^3 = 8 \\times p^{30}\n  \\]\n  \n- Since \\(8 = 2^3\\), substitute that in:\n  \\[\n  8n^3 = 2^3 \\times p^{30}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Okay, now the expression is clear: \\(2^3 \\times p^{30}\\).\n- This makes it straightforward to apply the divisor count formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Divisor Function to \\(8n^3\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I recall that the number of divisors \\(d(m)\\) is the product of each exponent incremented by one.\n- So, I need to calculate \\(d(2^3 \\times p^{30})\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Applying the formula:\n  \\[\n  d(8n^3) = (3 + 1)(30 + 1) = 4 \\times 31 = 124\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check the steps.\n- \\(2^3\\) contributes \\(3 + 1 = 4\\) and \\(p^{30}\\) contributes \\(30 + 1 = 31\\).\n- Multiplying these together gives \\(124\\).\n\n- That seems correct. Each prime's exponent incremented by one gives the number of divisors contributed by that prime.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Approach with an Alternative Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Even though the Prime Factorization Approach makes sense and gives a straightforward answer, it's always good to verify with another method.\n- I could try the **Exploring Patterns with Small Numbers** strategy to see if this aligns.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Let's consider a small prime, say \\(p = 3\\).\n- So, \\(n = 3^{10}\\).\n  \n- Calculate \\(n^3 = (3^{10})^3 = 3^{30}\\).\n  \n- Now, \\(8n^3 = 8 \\times 3^{30} = 2^3 \\times 3^{30}\\).\n  \n- Applying the divisor formula:\n  \\[\n  d(8n^3) = (3 + 1)(30 + 1) = 4 \\times 31 = 124\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- The alternative method also confirms the same result: 124 divisors.\n- This consistency strengthens the validity of the Prime Factorization Approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Before finalizing, let's ensure every step logically follows and the calculations are correct.\n- Does the structure of \\(n\\) make sense? Does the divisor count apply correctly?\n\n**Check:**\n\n- \\(n = p^{10}\\) leads to 11 divisors, which satisfies the initial condition.\n- \\(8n^3 = 2^3 \\times p^{30}\\) is correctly set up.\n- The divisor count calculation follows the formula accurately.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Everything checks out. The number of positive divisors of \\(8n^3\\) is indeed **124**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThrough brainstorming different strategies, starting with prime factorization, and verifying with an alternative approach, I've arrived at the conclusion that the number of positive divisors of \\(8n^3\\) is **124**. Along the way, I reflected on each step, checked calculations, and ensured consistency, which is crucial for solving such problems accurately.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $t(n) = 11$ is prime and is the product of 1 more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$, there can be only one exponent, and therefore one prime in the prime factorization of $n$.  This means $n = p^{10}$ for some odd prime number $p$, so $$ 8n^3 = 2^3 \\cdot p^{30} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(8n^3) = (3 + 1)(30 + 1) = \\boxed{124}. $$"
