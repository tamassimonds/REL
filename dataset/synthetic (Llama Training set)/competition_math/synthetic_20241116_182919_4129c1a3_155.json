    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: **Evaluate \\(\\log_3\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\)**.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see this, my initial thought is that it involves logarithms and possibly properties of exponents. I remember dealing with logarithms where you have fractional or radical expressions, so this feels somewhat familiar.\n\n- **Logarithm Base:** It\u2019s base 3, which is good because I\u2019m comfortable with logarithms base 3.\n- **Fraction and Square Root:** \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) looks a bit tricky because it involves both a fraction and a square root. I think I might need to manipulate this expression to make it easier to evaluate.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Logarithmic Properties:**\n   - Maybe I can apply properties of logarithms to simplify the expression inside the log.\n   - For example, properties like \\(\\log_b(\\frac{m}{n}) = \\log_b(m) - \\log_b(n)\\) or \\(\\log_b(m^k) = k \\cdot \\log_b(m)\\) come to mind.\n\n2. **Change of Base:**\n   - Alternatively, I could use the change of base formula to rewrite the logarithm in terms of natural logarithms or common logarithms.\n   - This might make it easier to evaluate if I don't remember the specific property.\n\n3. **Express in Exponential Form:**\n   - Maybe I can express \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) as an exponent of 3, since logarithms and exponents are inverses.\n   - I recall that exponents and logarithms are closely related, so this could be a path to explore.\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Using Logarithmic Properties**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first strategy and see where it leads.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Logarithm**\n\nThe expression is \\(\\log_3\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n\n- **What does this mean?** It\u2019s asking: \u201cTo what power must 3 be raised to equal \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\)?\u201d \n- This is directly related to the definition of logarithms.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I know that logarithms deal with exponents. So, I\u2019m looking for an exponent \\(x\\) such that:\n  \\[\n  3^x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Express \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) in Exponential Form**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Hmm, I remember that \\(\\sqrt{3} = 3^{1/2}\\).\n- Therefore, \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{3^{1/2}} = 3^{-1/2}\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = 3^{-1/2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Wait, does this make sense? Yes, because taking the reciprocal of the square root of 3 gives me \\(3^{-1/2}\\).\n\n**Step 3: Setting Up the Logarithm Equation**\n\nNow, substituting back into the logarithm:\n\\[\n\\log_3(3^{-1/2})\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- This looks more straightforward. I remember that \\(\\log_b(b^k) = k\\).\n- So, applying this property:\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\log_3(3^{-1/2}) = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Let\u2019s verify: If \\(3^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), then raising 3 to the power of \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) should indeed give \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n- Yes, \\(3^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), which matches the original expression.\n\n### **Exploring a Different Strategy: Change of Base**\n\nJust to be thorough, let\u2019s see if the change of base formula would lead to the same result.\n\n**Step 4: Applying Change of Base Formula**\n\nThe change of base formula is:\n\\[\n\\log_b(m) = \\frac{\\log_k(m)}{\\log_k(b)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is any positive number different from 1.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let\u2019s apply this to \\(\\log_3\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) using natural logarithms (\\(\\ln\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\log_3\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\ln(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})}{\\ln(3)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Hmm, this seems like a more roundabout way to get the same answer, but it\u2019s worth checking if it matches.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating \\(\\ln(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})\\)**\n\nFirst, simplify \\(\\ln(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})\\):\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\ln(3^{-1/2}) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(3)\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{\\ln(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})}{\\ln(3)} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(3)}{\\ln(3)} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Wait, this gives me the same result: \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\nBoth methods lead to the same answer: \\(\\log_3\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- This consistency suggests that the solution is correct.\n- By approaching it with different strategies, I\u2019ve cross-verified the result.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does the answer make sense? Yes, because \\(\\log_3\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) implies that raising 3 to the power of \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) gives \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), which aligns with our initial setup.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming and exploring multiple strategies, I concluded that:\n\\[\n\\log_3\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nBy using logarithmic properties and verifying through the change of base method, I ensured the accuracy of the solution. Checking each step along the way helped confirm that the approach was correct and the final answer is indeed \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).",
