    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were working on it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my progress, and make adjustments as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts** \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, I see that it's about finding the area of a region \\( S' \\) after applying a matrix transformation to \\( S \\). The matrix given is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} \n2 & 1 \\\\ \n7 & -3 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nAnd the area of \\( S \\) is 10.\n\n**What comes to mind:**\n\n- **Matrix Determinant:** I vaguely remember that the determinant of a transformation matrix relates to how areas are scaled. So maybe calculating the determinant of this matrix could be key.\n  \n- **Properties of Determinants:** Determinants can be positive, negative, or zero, affecting the area and orientation of the transformed shape. This makes me think I should pay attention to the sign and magnitude of the determinant.\n\n- **Verification Needed:** But I'm not entirely sure if this approach will directly give me the area of \\( S' \\). Maybe I need to reflect or check if there's something I'm missing.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculate Determinant and Scale Area Accordingly:** This seems like a straightforward approach. Compute the determinant and multiply the original area by this factor.\n\n2. **Explore Alternative Methods:** Perhaps there's another way to visualize or compute the area post-transformation, but the determinant method feels most direct based on what I remember.\n\n3. **Check with Simple Examples:** Maybe testing with a simpler matrix or a known shape could help validate the approach.\n\n**Reflecting:**\n- Does calculating the determinant make sense here? Yes, because it's a linear transformation affecting the area.\n- Should I consider the sign of the determinant? Absolutely, since it indicates whether the area is preserved or flipped.\n\nOkay, let's proceed with the determinant calculation as my primary strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Determinant of the Matrix**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI recall that the determinant of a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrix is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = ad - bc\n\\]\n\nwhere the matrix \\( A \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} \na & b \\\\ \nc & d \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Applying to Given Matrix:**\n\nFor the matrix\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} \n2 & 1 \\\\ \n7 & -3 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n- \\( a = 2 \\)\n- \\( b = 1 \\)\n- \\( c = 7 \\)\n- \\( d = -3 \\)\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = (2 \\times -3) - (1 \\times 7) = -6 - 7 = -13\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Wait, does a negative determinant make sense here? Yes, it indicates that the transformation flips the orientation of the area, which is fine as long as I account for its absolute value when scaling.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The determinant is \\(-13\\), so the scaling factor for the area is \\( |-13| = 13 \\).\n- This means the area of \\( S' \\) will be 13 times the area of \\( S \\).\n\n**Is this correct?**\n\n- Let's see: multiplying the area by the absolute value of the determinant is standard practice for linear transformations. So, it seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Area of \\( S' \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the scaling factor, I can compute the area of \\( S' \\) by multiplying the area of \\( S \\) by this factor.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven:\n\n- Area of \\( S = 10 \\)\n- Scaling factor = 13\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } S' = 10 \\times 13 = 130\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does this scaling seem reasonable? Multiplying by 13 significantly increases the area, which aligns with the determinant's absolute value.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The area of \\( S' \\) is 130. This makes sense given the determinant's scaling factor.\n- Double-checking: multiplying by the determinant's absolute value is the correct approach, so the answer should be accurate.\n\n**Is there anything wrong?**\n\n- I don't see any issues. The steps follow logically, and the calculations check out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me reflect and ensure that applying the determinant for area scaling is indeed the right method here.\n\n**Alternative Verification:**\n\n- **Determinant as Area Scale Factor:** I remember that in linear transformations, especially in \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\), the area of the transformed region is the original area multiplied by the absolute value of the determinant of the transformation matrix.\n  \n- **Orientation Consideration:** The negative sign in the determinant confirms that the transformation flips the orientation, but since we're interested in the area (which is intrinsically non-negative), taking the absolute value is appropriate.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Testing with Simple Matrices:** If I were to apply this to a simple shape like a square with area 1, using the same determinant method should yield consistent results. For instance, a matrix with a determinant of 4 would quadruple the area, which aligns with expectations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Given the properties of determinants and their role in linear transformations, the approach feels solid.\n- No alternative method seems simpler or more direct for this problem.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Final Reflection:** Applying the determinant to compute the scaling factor is a standard and correct approach. The answer of 130 makes sense both mathematically and contextually.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully calculating the determinant and applying it to scale the area of \\( S \\), the area of the transformed region \\( S' \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{130}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, calculating the determinant, and reflecting on each step, I've arrived at the area of \\( S' \\) as 130. Throughout the process, I checked and verified that each method was appropriate, ensuring the final answer is accurate.",
