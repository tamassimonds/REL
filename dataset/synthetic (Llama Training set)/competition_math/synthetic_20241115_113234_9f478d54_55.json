I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check if I'm on the right track, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **User Query**\n\nA right pyramid has a square base with an area of **288 square cm**. Its peak is **15 cm from each of the other vertices**. What is the volume of the pyramid, in cubic centimeters?\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at this problem, I immediately recognize that it's dealing with a **right pyramid**. I remember that in a right pyramid, the apex (or peak) is directly above the center of the base. That might help in visualizing the problem.\n\n- **Square Base:** This makes things a bit simpler because all sides are equal.\n- **Area of the Base:** I have the area, so I can find the length of each side.\n- **Distance from Peak to Vertices:** The fact that the peak is 15 cm from each vertex is interesting. It suggests that all edges from the peak to the base's vertices are equal.\n\nInitially, I'm thinking this might involve using the formula for the volume of a pyramid and determining the height. But I'm not sure how to find the height just yet. Let me brainstorm some strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Pythagorean Theorem:** Since it's a right pyramid, maybe I can right-angle triangle relationships between the height, slant height, and half the base's side.\n\n2. **Coordinates Approach:** Assign coordinates to each vertex and use distance formulas to find relationships.\n\n3. **Volume Formula for Pyramids:** Recall the volume formula \\( V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} \\). But I still need the height.\n\nAt this point, the **Pythagorean Theorem** approach stands out because I know the lengths involved form right triangles. But wait, I should confirm if that's the right direction.\n\nHmm... before proceeding, let me visualize: In a right pyramid, the height is perpendicular to the base, and the distances given are from the peak to the base's vertices. It seems the Pythagorean Theorem could relate the height, half the base's diagonal, and the given distance.\n\nLet me try the **Pythagorean Theorem** approach first. But if I get stuck, I'll switch to the coordinates method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Base**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I know the base is square and has an area of 288 cm\u00b2.\n- To find the side length of the square base, I can use the formula for the area of a square: \\( \\text{Area} = s^2 \\), where \\( s \\) is the side length.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\ns^2 = 288 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s = \\sqrt{288} = 12\\sqrt{2} \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, I think that's correct. The side length \\( s \\) is \\( 12\\sqrt{2} \\) cm. This makes sense since \\( \\sqrt{288} \\) simplifies to \\( 12\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nLet me quickly check:\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{288})^2 = 288\n\\]\n\nYup, that works. So, the side length is definitely \\( 12\\sqrt{2} \\) cm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Diagonal of the Base**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the relationship needed, I think knowing the diagonal of the square base might help.\n- In a square, the diagonal \\( d \\) can be calculated using \\( d = s\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nd = 12\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 24 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me think about it. The diagonal being 24 cm makes sense because multiplying the side by \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is correct.\n\nQuick check:\n\n\\[\n12\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 12 \\times 2 = 24\n\\]\n\nYup, that's correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding Half the Diagonal**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need half the diagonal because in a right pyramid, the apex forms a right triangle with half the diagonal of the base and the height.\n- So, I divide the diagonal by 2.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Half Diagonal} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat makes sense. Half the diagonal being 12 cm aligns with the geometry I'm picturing.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height of the pyramid.\n- The theorem relates the sides of a right triangle: \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\).\n- Here, \\( a \\) is the height, \\( b \\) is half the diagonal of the base, and \\( c \\) is the distance from the peak to a vertex.\n\n**Given:**\n\n- \\( b = 12 \\) cm (half diagonal)\n- \\( c = 15 \\) cm (distance from peak to vertex)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\na^2 + 12^2 = 15^2 \\\\\na^2 + 144 = 225 \\\\\na^2 = 225 - 144 \\\\\na^2 = 81 \\\\\na = \\sqrt{81} = 9 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute... the height comes out to be 9 cm. Let me think about this. Does it make sense for the height to be 9 cm when the distances to the vertices are 15 cm? Hmm, I should double-check my steps.\n\nQuick check:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 144 = 225 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 81 + 144 = 225 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 225 = 225\n\\]\n\nYes, the math checks out. So, the height is indeed 9 cm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Volume of the Pyramid**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have the height, I can use the volume formula for pyramids.\n- The formula is \\( V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 288 \\times 9 \\\\\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 2592 \\\\\nV = 864 \\text{ cm}^3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe volume comes out to be **864 cm\u00b3**. Let me think about this.\n\n- The base area is significant, and the height being 9 cm seems reasonable given the distances to the vertices.\n- I briefly considered whether the height should be more significant relative to the distance to the vertices, but in this case, the calculations align.\n\nQuick check:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 288 \\times 9 = \\frac{2592}{3} = 864\n\\]\n\nYes, the calculations are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Base Area Calculation:** Correct.\n- **Diagonal and Half-Diagonal Calculations:** Correct.\n- **Pythagorean Theorem Application:** Checks out.\n- **Volume Calculation:** Correct.\n\nEverything seems to be in order. The volume of the pyramid is indeed **864 cm\u00b3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nInitially, I wasn't entirely sure how to connect the given distances to the height of the pyramid. By brainstorming different strategies and opting to use the Pythagorean Theorem, I was able to find the height and subsequently calculate the volume.\n\nThroughout the process, I checked my intermediate steps to ensure accuracy, which helped catch any potential mistakes early on. In the end, the volume calculation aligned well with the provided dimensions, confirming the solution's validity.\n\nDoing it like this\u2014thinking aloud, reflecting, and continuously checking\u2014ensures a thorough and accurate approach to solving the problem.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding how to tackle such problems step by step!",

Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFB$ is a right triangle.  The area of the base of the pyramid is 288 square cm, so the length of each side of the base is $12\\sqrt{2}$ cm.  Since $F$ is the center of the base, $FB$ is half the diagonal of the base, or $(12\\sqrt{2}\\cdot\\sqrt{2})/2 = 12$ cm.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $PFB$ gives  \\[PF = \\sqrt{PB^2 - FB^2} = \\sqrt{225 - 144} = \\sqrt{81} = 9,\\]so the volume of the pyramid is $[ABCD](PF)/3 = (288)(9)/3 = 288\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{864}$ cubic centimeters."
