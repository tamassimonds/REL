    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through each part just like how I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work, and be open to adjusting my approach if something doesn\u2019t seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem is:  \n\\[\n(15x^2) \\cdot (6x) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{(3x)^2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is that this involves multiplying and perhaps simplifying expressions with variables and exponents. It looks like a mix of coefficients (numbers) and variables raised to powers, along with a fraction that has a squared term in the denominator.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Multiply all the coefficients and variables together as a single expression.\n- **Strategy 2:** Simplify the expression step by step, handling exponents and fractions carefully.\n- **Strategy 3:** Use properties of exponents to simplify before multiplying, especially with the fractional part.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI'm leaning towards **Strategy 2**, simplifying step by step, because dealing with exponents and fractions together can get tricky. But I\u2019ll also keep an eye out for opportunities to apply properties of exponents, which might make things easier.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Break Down the Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start by rewriting the expression to see if grouping certain parts makes it easier to handle. The expression has three main components multiplied together.\n\n\\[\n(15x^2) \\cdot (6x) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{(3x)^2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nMaybe separating the coefficients from the variable parts could help.\n\n**Rewriting:**\n\n\\[\n(15 \\cdot 6) \\cdot (x^2 \\cdot x) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{(3x)^2}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks better because now I can handle the coefficients and variables separately. Let\u2019s tackle the coefficients first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Multiply the Coefficients**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlright, multiply 15 and 6 together. Simple arithmetic.\n\n\\[\n15 \\cdot 6 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n90 \\times \\text{(rest of the expression)}\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct. Moving on to the variable parts.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplify the Variable Parts**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, focus on simplifying \\( x^2 \\cdot x \\) and dealing with the fractional exponent in the denominator.\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\cdot x = x^{2+1} = x^3\n\\]\n\nFor the fractional part:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{(3x)^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{9x^2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, did I apply the exponent correctly? Yes, because \\((3x)^2 = 3^2 \\cdot x^2 = 9x^2\\). So the reciprocal is \\(\\frac{1}{9x^2}\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\nx^3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{9x^2} = \\frac{x^3}{9x^2}\n\\]\n\nThis looks correct so far. Let\u2019s simplify this fraction next.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, simplify \\(\\frac{x^3}{9x^2}\\) by canceling out common factors.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^3}{x^2} = x^{3-2} = x^1 = x\n\\]\n\nSo, \n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^3}{9x^2} = \\frac{x}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat seems right. Canceling \\(x^2\\) from \\(x^3\\) leaves \\(x\\), and the 9 in the denominator stays. No mistakes here.\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n(90) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{x}{9}\\right) = \\frac{90x}{9} = 10x\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies perfectly to \\(10x\\). Let\u2019s finalize the steps to ensure everything is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore concluding, let\u2019s verify each part to ensure no errors were made along the way.\n\n1. **Co-efficients:**\n   \\[\n   15 \\cdot 6 = 90 \\quad \\text{(correct)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Variable Exponents:**\n   \\[\n   x^2 \\cdot x = x^3 \\quad \\text{(correct)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Fraction Simplification:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^3}{9x^2} = x \\quad \\text{(correct)}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Final Multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   90 \\cdot \\frac{x}{9} = 10x \\quad \\text{(correct)}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The approach worked well, and the solution makes sense. If I had encountered any discrepancies, I would\u2019ve revisited each step, but it looks clean.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter breaking down the problem step by step, verifying each part, and ensuring the correctness of the approach, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10x}\n\\]\n\nBy thinking through each stage, checking my work regularly, and being open to adjusting my strategy, I confidently arrived at the correct solution.",
