I'll brainstorm different strategies, share my initial thoughts, reflect frequently, and check my work along the way to ensure we're on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem **Compute \\( \\tan (-3645^\\circ) \\)**, several things come to mind:\n\n1. **Negative Angle:** I remember that trigonometric functions have specific properties when dealing with negative angles. Maybe I can use the periodicity of the tangent function here.\n\n2. **Large Angle:** \\(3645^\\circ\\) is a pretty large angle. Typically, I know that trigonometric functions are periodic, so perhaps reducing this angle to a smaller, equivalent angle could make calculations easier.\n\n3. **Reference Angles:** I recall that finding a reference angle might help, especially in determining the exact value of the tangent after reducing it.\n\n4. **General Strategies:** Possible strategies include:\n    - Using the periodicity of the tangent function.\n    - Converting the angle into radians (though I think sticking to degrees might be simpler since the question is already in degrees).\n    - Breaking down the angle into smaller components that are easier to handle.\n\nAt this point, I feel like reducing the angle using its periodicity is the most straightforward approach. But I'm also open to exploring other methods if this doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Using Periodicity of Tangent**\n\n- The tangent function has a period of \\(180^\\circ\\), meaning \\( \\tan(\\theta) = \\tan(\\theta + 180^\\circ) \\).\n- So, I could reduce \\( -3645^\\circ \\) by adding or subtracting \\( 180^\\circ \\) multiple times until it falls within a standard range.\n\n**Reflection:** This seems like a logical starting point. By reducing the angle, I can simplify the problem dramatically.\n\n**Strategy 2: Converting to Radians**\n\n- Although the question is in degrees, I could convert \\(3645^\\circ\\) to radians and then apply the periodicity.\n- However, I think sticking to degrees is more straightforward since that's how the question is presented.\n\n**Reflection:** Converting to radians might complicate things unnecessarily, especially since the periodicity in degrees is clear. I'll stick to degrees.\n\n**Strategy 3: Breaking Down the Angle**\n\n- Another approach could be to break down \\(3645^\\circ\\) into smaller angles that sum up to it, perhaps using known angles where tangent values are familiar.\n- But this might be more time-consuming and isn't immediately necessary if reducing the angle using periodicity works.\n\n**Reflection:** This seems like overkill for the problem. If reducing the angle works, why complicate it? Let's proceed with Strategy 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Reducing the Angle Using Periodicity**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since the tangent function is periodic with a period of \\(180^\\circ\\), I can reduce the negative angle by adding \\(180^\\circ\\) repeatedly until it falls within a standard range.\n- Let's see how many times I need to add \\(180^\\circ\\) to bring \\( -3645^\\circ \\) into a positive angle less than or equal to \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n-3645^\\circ + 180^\\circ \\times n = \\text{Positive Angle} \\leq 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( n \\) is the number of times \\(180^\\circ\\) is added.\n\nLet's find \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&-3645^\\circ + 180^\\circ \\times n \\geq 0^\\circ \\\\\n&180^\\circ \\times n \\geq 3645^\\circ \\\\\n&n \\geq \\frac{3645^\\circ}{180^\\circ} \\\\\n&n \\geq 20.25\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Since \\( n \\) must be a whole number, I'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is \\(21\\).\n- This means I need to add \\(180^\\circ\\) twenty-one times to bring the angle into a positive range.\n\n**Checking the Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n180^\\circ \\times 21 = 3780^\\circ\n\\]\n\\[\n-3645^\\circ + 3780^\\circ = 135^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo, adding \\(180^\\circ\\) twenty-one times brings \\( -3645^\\circ \\) to \\(135^\\circ\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, adding \\(180^\\circ\\) twenty-one times gives me \\(135^\\circ\\), which is within the \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(180^\\circ\\) range.\n- But earlier, I calculated \\(21\\) as the minimum integer. Let's double-check:\n\n\\[\n3780^\\circ - 3645^\\circ = 135^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Correct Approach:** Adding \\(180^\\circ\\) twenty-one times is correct because it brings the angle to \\(135^\\circ\\).\n- **Mistake Realization:** Initially, adding \\(21\\) seemed like it would go beyond \\(180^\\circ\\), but it actually lands at \\(135^\\circ\\), which is valid.\n\n**Final Reduced Angle:**\n\n\\[\n\\theta = 135^\\circ\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding \\( \\tan(135^\\circ) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that we've reduced the angle to \\(135^\\circ\\), I need to find the tangent of this angle.\n- I remember that \\(135^\\circ\\) is in the second quadrant, where the tangent function is negative.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Reference Angle:** The reference angle for \\(135^\\circ\\) is:\n  \n  \\[\n  180^\\circ - 135^\\circ = 45^\\circ\n  \\]\n\n- **Tangent Value:** Since tangent is negative in the second quadrant, and the tangent of the reference angle \\(45^\\circ\\) is \\(1\\):\n  \n  \\[\n  \\tan(135^\\circ) = -\\tan(45^\\circ) = -1\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This makes sense because \\(135^\\circ\\) is in the second quadrant, and the properties of trigonometric functions tell us that tangent should be negative here.\n- Checking if the reference angle and negative sign align correctly: Yes, \\( \\tan(45^\\circ) = 1\\), so \\( \\tan(135^\\circ) = -1\\).\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- Is \\( \\tan(135^\\circ) = -1 \\) correct?\n- Think about the unit circle: At \\(135^\\circ\\), the coordinates are \\((-1/\\sqrt{2}, +1/\\sqrt{2})\\), and tangent is the ratio of sine to cosine, which gives:\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\sin(135^\\circ)}{\\cos(135^\\circ)} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{2}}{-1/\\sqrt{2}} = -1\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Correct Value:** \\( \\tan(135^\\circ) = -1 \\)\n- **Approach Validity:** Reducing the angle using periodicity was the correct approach, and finding the reference angle led to the correct tangent value.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- After successfully reducing the angle and finding the tangent of the corresponding positive angle, I can confidently state the answer.\n- It's important to ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one and that the calculations align with trigonometric properties.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\tan(-3645^\\circ) = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Throughout the process, checking the correctness after each major step helped catch any potential mistakes early.\n- By validating the reference angle and understanding the properties of the tangent function in different quadrants, the solution remains consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Checks**\n\n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n  - Yes, \\( \\tan(-3645^\\circ) = -1 \\) aligns with the properties of the tangent function after reducing the angle appropriately.\n\n- **Are All Steps Justified?**\n  - Each step builds on the previous one, starting from reducing the angle using periodicity to calculating the tangent based on the reference angle.\n\n- **Could There Be an Alternative Approach?**\n  - While other strategies like converting to radians or breaking down the angle could work, using the periodicity of the tangent function proved to be the most straightforward and effective method for this problem.\n\n---\n\nBy following this step-by-step approach, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and continually checking the work, I've arrived at the correct solution: \\( \\tan(-3645^\\circ) = -1 \\). This method ensures clarity and correctness, mirroring a natural human thought process when solving a mathematical problem.",
