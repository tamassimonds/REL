I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each approach, check my work regularly, and adjust my methods as needed\u2014just like a human would when tackling a math problem. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question:\n\n**For how many different negative values of \\( x \\) is \\( \\sqrt{x + 150} \\) a positive integer?**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving perfect squares. I remember dealing with square roots yielding integers before. But then, I think, it's specifically about negative \\( x \\) values\u2014maybe that narrows things down.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Set Up an Equation:** Assume \\( \\sqrt{x + 150} = n \\), where \\( n \\) is a positive integer. Solve for \\( x \\).\n  2. **Consider Perfect Squares:** Since \\( \\sqrt{x + 150} \\) must be an integer, \\( x + 150 \\) should be a perfect square.\n  3. **Check Negative Values:** Ensure that the solutions for \\( x \\) are negative.\n\n- **But Wait:** Does setting \\( \\sqrt{x + 150} = n \\) cover all cases? What if there are multiple \\( n \\) leading to negative \\( x \\)? I should explore this further.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Set Up an Equation**\n\n**Brainstorming:** Let's assume \\( \\sqrt{x + 150} = n \\), where \\( n \\) is a positive integer. This should give us a direct relationship.\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x + 150} = n \\implies x + 150 = n^2 \\implies x = n^2 - 150\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Okay, this looks straightforward. For each positive integer \\( n \\), we can find a corresponding \\( x \\). But since we're only interested in negative \\( x \\), we need to find \\( n \\) values that make \\( x \\) negative.\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n\\[\nx = n^2 - 150 < 0 \\implies n^2 < 150\n\\]\n\nWait, that means \\( n < \\sqrt{150} \\). Let's calculate \\( \\sqrt{150} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{150} \\approx 12.25\n\\]\n\n**Realization:** Since \\( n \\) must be a positive integer, \\( n \\) can take values from 1 to 12. That seems manageable.\n\n**Reflection:** But does this cover all negative \\( x \\) values? What about \\( n \\) values beyond 12? Would they produce negative \\( x \\) as well?\n\n---\n\n### **Checking Strategy 1: Does It Capture All Solutions?**\n\n**Re-evaluation:** Let's plug in the maximum \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn = 12 \\implies x = 12^2 - 150 = 144 - 150 = -6\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** \\( x = -6 \\) is negative. But what about \\( n = 13 \\)?\n\n\\[\nn = 13 \\implies x = 13^2 - 150 = 169 - 150 = 19\n\\]\n\n**Observation:** Wait, \\( x = 19 \\) is positive. So, \\( n \\) values above 12 don't contribute negative \\( x \\). This suggests that only \\( n \\) from 1 to 12 are relevant.\n\n**Conclusion:** Strategy 1 seems to work, but let's see if there's a more intuitive way.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Consider Perfect Squares**\n\n**Brainstorming:** Instead of setting up an equation, think about what \\( x + 150 \\) being a perfect square means. Maybe visualize it differently.\n\n**Approach:** List perfect squares less than or equal to 150:\n\n\\[\n1^2 = 1, \\quad 2^2 = 4, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad \\dots, \\quad 12^2 = 144\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Each of these corresponds to an \\( n \\) value. For each perfect square, subtract 150 to find \\( x \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1 & : 1 - 150 = -149 \\\\\n4 & : 4 - 150 = -146 \\\\\n9 & : 9 - 150 = -141 \\\\\n16 & : 16 - 150 = -134 \\\\\n25 & : 25 - 150 = -125 \\\\\n36 & : 36 - 150 = -114 \\\\\n49 & : 49 - 150 = -101 \\\\\n64 & : 64 - 150 = -86 \\\\\n81 & : 81 - 150 = -69 \\\\\n100 & : 100 - 150 = -50 \\\\\n121 & : 121 - 150 = -29 \\\\\n144 & : 144 - 150 = -6 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:** All these \\( x \\) values are negative. This method seems logical. But let's verify by comparing with Strategy 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Comparing Strategies: Consistency Check**\n\n**Quick Check:** Strategy 1 suggested \\( n \\) values from 1 to 12, leading to \\( x \\) values from -149 to -6. Strategy 2 lists all perfect squares up to 144, also yielding negative \\( x \\) values.\n\n**Observation:** Both strategies yield the same set of \\( x \\) values. That's a good sign.\n\n**Reflection:** Since both methods agree, it reinforces the correctness. But to be thorough, let's count the distinct negative \\( x \\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Counting: How Many Different Negative \\( x \\) Values?**\n\n**List of Negative \\( x \\) Values:**\n\n\\[\n-149, -146, -141, -134, -125, -114, -101, -86, -69, -50, -29, -6\n\\]\n\n**Counting:** There are **12** different negative values.\n\n**Quick Check:** Does this seem reasonable? Yes, each perfect square from 1 to 144 yields a unique negative \\( x \\).\n\n**Realization:** The count aligns with both strategies, confirming the solution's validity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection: Is the Solution Correct?**\n\n**Thought Process:** By considering perfect squares and ensuring \\( x \\) remains negative, we've accounted for all possible \\( n \\) values leading to negative \\( x \\).\n\n**Checking the Approach:** Both strategies\u2014setting up the equation and listing perfect squares\u2014yield consistent results. The counting confirms the number of solutions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The solution is correct. There are **12** different negative values of \\( x \\) for which \\( \\sqrt{x + 150} \\) is a positive integer.\n\n---\n\nAlright, we've walked through the problem, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and ensuring our solution is accurate. By considering both equation setups and conceptual approaches, we've confidently arrived at the correct number of negative \\( x \\) values.",
