    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and explore different strategies to find the value of \\( y \\) so that the slope of the line through points \\( P(-2, 7) \\) and \\( Q(4, y) \\) is \\( \\frac{-3}{2} \\).\n\n### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, my immediate thought is that it involves calculating the slope between two points in the coordinate plane. I remember that the slope formula relates the change in \\( y \\) to the change in \\( x \\), which makes sense here since we're given two points.\n\n**Potential Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Application of the Slope Formula:** Use the slope formula to relate \\( y \\) and the given coordinates.\n   \n2. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Set up an equation based on the slope and solve for \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:** Although not explicitly required, sketching might provide insight into the relationship.\n\n4. **Check by Substitution:** Once \\( y \\) is found, substitute back to ensure the slope condition is satisfied.\n\n**First Thoughts:** I think starting with the **direct application of the slope formula** would be the most straightforward. If that doesn't work, I can explore other methods like algebraic manipulation or checking by substitution.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Slope Formula**\n\nThe slope \\( m \\) between two points \\( P(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( Q(x_2, y_2) \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n\\]\n\n**Given:**\n\n- \\( P(-2, 7) \\)\n- \\( Q(4, y) \\)\n- Slope \\( m = \\frac{-3}{2} \\)\n\n**Substituting Known Values:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y - 7}{4 - (-2)} = \\frac{-3}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** The denominator simplifies to \\( 6 \\), which looks straightforward. Let's compute that.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y - 7}{6} = \\frac{-3}{2}\n\\]\n\nCheck: Does this make sense so far? Yes, the formula applies directly, and the numbers are simplifying correctly.\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for \\( y \\)**\n\nNow, I need to isolate \\( y \\). To do this, I'll cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction.\n\n\\[\n2(y - 7) = -3 \\times 6\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n2(y - 7) = -18\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** So far, so good. Now, let's distribute the \\( 2 \\) on the left side.\n\n\\[\n2y - 14 = -18\n\\]\n\nCheck: Does everything look correct here? No errors in distribution, so let's proceed.\n\n### **Step 3: Isolating \\( y \\)**\n\nNext, I'll add \\( 14 \\) to both sides to solve for \\( y \\).\n\n\\[\n2y = -18 + 14\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n2y = -4\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Wait a minute \u2014 that adds up correctly. Now, dividing both sides by \\( 2 \\) to get \\( y \\).\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2\n\\]\n\nCheck: The arithmetic checks out. \\( y = -2 \\) seems plausible. But let's ensure this value satisfies the original slope condition.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, it's essential to verify if substituting \\( y = -2 \\) into the slope formula gives the correct slope.\n\n**Substituting \\( y = -2 \\) into the slope formula:**\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{-2 - 7}{4 - (-2)} = \\frac{-9}{6} = \\frac{-3}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** The calculated slope matches the given slope condition. So, \\( y = -2 \\) is indeed the correct value.\n\n**Thoughts:** This confirms our solution. The substitution back into the slope formula validates that \\( y = -2 \\) satisfies the condition.\n\n### **Reflection and Alternate Strategies**\n\nInitially, I thought about possibly using a graphical approach or checking by substitution separately. However, the direct application of the slope formula worked smoothly without complications. If the numbers had been messier or if the slope condition involved more complex fractions, revisiting alternative methods might have been necessary.\n\n**Mistakes or Realizations:** There were no significant mistakes in the calculation, but it's always good to reflect periodically to ensure each step logically follows the previous one.\n\n**Random Insight:** If I had chosen to start with checking if the slope condition was met by \\( y = -2 \\), it might have saved time, but since the direct method was straightforward, it worked out well.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully applying the slope formula, isolating \\( y \\), and verifying the solution, the value of \\( y \\) that makes the slope of the line through points \\( P(-2, 7) \\) and \\( Q(4, y) \\) equal to \\( \\frac{-3}{2} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2}\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out, and the approach was consistent from start to finish.",
