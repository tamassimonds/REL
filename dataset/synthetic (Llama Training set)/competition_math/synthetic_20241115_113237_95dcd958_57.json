I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and be ready to change my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**\"What is the least prime number which is the sum of two distinct positive perfect squares?\"**\n\nI think, *Hmm, this reminds me of problems involving sums of squares and primes. I believe there's a connection between number theory concepts here, possibly involving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. But honestly, I'm not 100% sure how to connect all the dots right now.*\n\nInitial impressions:\n\n- **Prime numbers:** Only divisible by 1 and themselves.\n- **Perfect squares:** Numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.\n- **Sum of two distinct perfect squares:** Adding two different perfect squares together.\n\nI recall that not all primes can be expressed as the sum of two squares, and there's a famous theorem related to this. But let me explore a bit to see different strategies.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List Perfect Squares and Their Sums:**\n   - Start by listing small perfect squares and adding them together to see which sums are prime.\n\n2. **Use Fermat\u2019s Theorem on Sums of Two Squares:**\n   - Recall that a prime \\( p \\) can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if \\( p = 2 \\) or \\( p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\).\n\n3. **Check Small Primes Individually:**\n   - For each small prime, check if it can be expressed as the sum of two distinct positive perfect squares.\n\nInitially, I'm leaning towards **Listing Perfect Squares and Their Sums** because it seems straightforward. But I might need to use **Fermat\u2019s theorem** to confirm my findings later.\n\n### **Step 1: Listing Small Perfect Squares**\n\nLet\u2019s start by listing the first few perfect squares:\n\n- \\( 1^2 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n- \\( 4^2 = 16 \\)\n- \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n- \\( 6^2 = 36 \\), and so on.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*This seems like a good start. I'll look for sums of two distinct squares among these.*\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Sums of Two Distinct Perfect Squares**\n\nNow, let\u2019s add these perfect squares together, ensuring they are distinct:\n\n- \\( 1 + 4 = 5 \\)\n- \\( 1 + 9 = 10 \\)\n- \\( 1 + 16 = 17 \\)\n- \\( 1 + 25 = 26 \\)\n- \\( 4 + 9 = 13 \\)\n- \\( 4 + 16 = 20 \\)\n- \\( 9 + 16 = 25 \\)\n- \u2026 and so on.\n\n**Check:**\n\n*Wait, let me pause and ensure I\u2019m only considering distinct squares and that the sums are correct.*\n\n*Looks good so far. I'll continue listing until I have enough to see a pattern.*\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Prime Numbers Among the Sums**\n\nFrom the list above, let's find which sums are prime:\n\n- \\( 5 \\) is prime.\n- \\( 10 \\) is not prime (divisible by 2).\n- \\( 17 \\) is prime.\n- \\( 26 \\) is not prime (divisible by 2).\n- \\( 13 \\) is prime.\n- \\( 20 \\) is not prime (divisible by 2).\n- \\( 25 \\) is not prime (perfect square).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*Hmm, among the sums I\u2019ve listed, 5, 13, 17 are primes. But 5 is the smallest. Let me check if 5 is indeed the sum of two distinct perfect squares.*\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Sum 5**\n\nDoes 5 equal the sum of two distinct perfect squares?\n\n- From my earlier list: \\( 1 + 4 = 5 \\) (which are \\( 1^2 \\) and \\( 2^2 \\)).\n\n**Check:**\n\n*That works! 5 is the sum of \\( 1^2 \\) and \\( 2^2 \\), which are distinct.*\n\n**Recollection:**\n\n*Wait a moment, let me think about this.* Is 5 really the least prime that can be expressed as the sum of two distinct positive perfect squares? I remember that Fermat\u2019s theorem states that every prime \\( p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\) can be expressed as the sum of two squares. But 5 is \\( 2 \\mod 4 \\), so it should still work because it\u2019s \\( 2 \\) (which is a special case).\n\n### **Step 5: Confirming with Fermat\u2019s Theorem**\n\nFermat\u2019s theorem on sums of two squares states:\n\n- A prime \\( p \\) can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if:\n  - \\( p = 2 \\) or\n  - \\( p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*Wait, let me see...* 5 is \\( 2 \\mod 4 \\), which is an exception because the theorem also states that \\( p = 2 \\) can be expressed as \\( 1^2 + 1^2 \\), but that\u2019s not distinct. However, since 5 is \\( 2^2 + 1^2 \\), and 2 and 1 are distinct, it fits the requirement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*Okay, I think 5 is indeed the correct answer. But let me double-check just to be sure.*\n\n### **Step 6: Double-Checking with Additional Sums**\n\nLet me check some more sums to see if there\u2019s a smaller prime that can be expressed this way:\n\n- \\( 1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10 \\) (not prime)\n- \\( 2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13 \\) (prime)\n- \\( 1^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17 \\) (prime)\n- \\( 1^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 25 = 26 \\) (not prime)\n\n**Check:**\n\n*So far, 10 and 26 are not primes. 13 and 17 are primes, but 13 > 5.*\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*This reinforces that 5 is indeed the smallest prime that can be expressed as the sum of two distinct perfect squares.*\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me re-read the question:\n\n- **Least prime number:** So we\u2019re looking for the smallest prime.\n- **Sum of two distinct positive perfect squares:** Must be distinct and positive.\n\n*Everything seems to align. 5 is the smallest prime that meets all the criteria.*\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe least prime number which is the sum of two distinct positive perfect squares is **5**.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout this process:\n\n- **Brainstorming helped:** Starting with listing perfect squares allowed me to see possible sums.\n- **Checking each step was crucial:** It ensured that I didn't miss any small primes or make calculation errors.\n- **Using Fermat\u2019s theorem validated my result:** It confirmed that 5 fits the criteria even though it\u2019s \\( 2 \\mod 4 \\).\n\n*In conclusion, approaching the problem step-by-step, reflecting and checking at each stage, led me to confidently identify 5 as the correct answer.*",
