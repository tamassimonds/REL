    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just as I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure to check my work along the way to ensure everything makes sense. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see that the measures of the interior angles of a triangle are in a **5:6:7 ratio**. I'm asked to find the measure of the **smallest interior angle**.\n\nInitially, this reminds me of problems where you deal with ratios and proportions, similar to finding parts of a whole. I know that the sum of interior angles in any triangle is always **180 degrees**. That\u2019s a crucial fact to keep in mind.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to set this up right away. My first instinct is to use the ratio to express each angle in terms of a common multiple, but I need to think this through a bit more to make sure it\u2019s the right approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use Proportions with a Variable:**\n   - Assign a variable to each part of the ratio.\n   - Set up an equation based on the sum of angles being 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Convert Ratios to Actual Angles:**\n   - Directly convert the ratio into degrees by scaling it up to 180.\n\n3. **Check if Simplifying the Ratio First Helps:**\n   - Maybe simplifying the ratio could make calculations easier.\n\nI think starting with assigning a variable to each part of the ratio might be the most straightforward. Let\u2019s see if that works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Assigning Variables to the Ratio**\n\nLet\u2019s denote the interior angles as follows:\n\n- **Angle A:** 5x\n- **Angle B:** 6x\n- **Angle C:** 7x\n\nHere, **x** is the common multiple.\n\n**Reflection:** This makes sense because using a variable allows me to express each angle in terms of **x**, which should help in setting up the equation for the sum of angles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation Based on the Sum of Angles**\n\nI know that the sum of the interior angles in a triangle is **180 degrees**. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n5x + 6x + 7x = 180\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Adding all the parts of the ratio together should equal 180 degrees. This feels like the right approach because it directly uses the given information.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n5x + 6x + 7x = 18x\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n18x = 180\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for x**\n\nNow, I need to solve for **x**:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{180}{18} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, let me double-check this. Dividing 180 by 18 gives me 10, which seems reasonable. I\u2019ll proceed but keep an eye out for any inconsistencies later.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating Each Angle**\n\nNow that I have **x = 10**, I can find each angle:\n\n1. **Angle A:** \\(5x = 5 \\times 10 = 50^\\circ\\)\n2. **Angle B:** \\(6x = 6 \\times 10 = 60^\\circ\\)\n3. **Angle C:** \\(7x = 7 \\times 10 = 70^\\circ\\)\n\n**Reflection:** These angles add up to 180 degrees:\n\n\\[\n50 + 60 + 70 = 180\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the calculations are correct so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying the Smallest Angle**\n\nFrom the calculated angles:\n\n- **Angle A:** 50 degrees\n- **Angle B:** 60 degrees\n- **Angle C:** 70 degrees\n\nThe **smallest interior angle** is clearly **50 degrees**.\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, 50 degrees is less than 60 and 70, and it fits within the triangle\u2019s interior angle requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Cross-Verification**\n\nLet me check if there\u2019s another way to approach this problem to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Alternative Approach:** Scaling the Ratio to 180 Degrees\n\nGiven the ratio **5:6:7**, I can think of it as parts of 180 degrees:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total parts} = 5 + 6 + 7 = 18\n\\]\n\nEach part represents:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{180}{18} = 10^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n- **Smallest Angle:** \\(5 \\times 10 = 50^\\circ\\)\n\n**Reflection:** This alternative method leads to the same result, which reinforces that our original approach was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\n- **Sum of Angles:** \\(50 + 60 + 70 = 180\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Each Angle in Ratio:** \n  - \\(50 = 5 \\times 10\\)\n  - \\(60 = 6 \\times 10\\)\n  - \\(70 = 7 \\times 10\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. The measure of the smallest interior angle is indeed **50 degrees**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBy assigning a variable to each part of the ratio and setting up an equation based on the sum of the interior angles, I was able to find that the smallest interior angle measures **50 degrees**. Reflecting and cross-verifying with an alternative approach ensured the accuracy of the solution.\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure to check each step and confirm that the calculations aligned with the properties of triangles, which helped catch any potential mistakes early on.",

  "ground_truth": "Choose $k$ so that the smallest angle measures $5k$ degrees.  Then the measures of the other two angles are $6k$ degrees and $7k$ degrees.  Since the measures of the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have $5k+6k+7k=180\\implies 18k=180\\implies k=10$.  The smallest angle measures $5k=5(10)=\\boxed{50}$ degrees."
