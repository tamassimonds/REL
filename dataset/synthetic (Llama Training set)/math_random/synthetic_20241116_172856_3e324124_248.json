    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At the outset, I notice that we have an expression involving exponents: \\((5^{-2})^0 + (5^0)^3\\). Exponents can sometimes be tricky, but I've done similar problems before, and that helps me get a starting point.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n- Breaking down the expression, we have two parts: \\((5^{-2})^0\\) and \\((5^0)^3\\).\n- Both involve a basic understanding of exponents and any exponent raised to the power of 0.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n1. When any non-zero number is raised to the power of 0, the result is always 1. Oh, that\u2019s a basic exponent rule! So, \\((5^{-2})^0\\) should equal 1. \n   - Wait, let me mentally run through the reasoning: anything non-zero raised to the power of zero is indeed 1. Makes sense!\n\n2. Next, look at \\((5^0)^3\\). \n   - I recall that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So \\(5^0\\) should be 1. \n   - Hmm, that means \\((5^0)^3\\) translates to \\(1^3\\).\n\n**Solving Each Part:**\n\n1. \\((5^{-2})^0 = 1\\). \n   - This holds because, again, any number to the power of 0 is 1. It doesn't matter what the base is, as long as it is non-zero.\n\n2. \\((5^0)^3\\):\n   - First, calculate \\(5^0\\), which is 1.\n   - Then, \\(1^3\\) equals 1. \n\n**Combining the Results:**\n\n- So, \\((5^{-2})^0 + (5^0)^3 = 1 + 1\\).\n\n**Result:**\n\n- The final calculation gives 2. With these types of problems, it's all about applying those core rules of exponents.\n\n**Double Check:**\n\n- Revisiting the basic exponential rules ensures the solutions for each part are correct. Both parts agree with fundamental properties of exponents.\n- Check intuition: Adding two independent results (both 1), it matches what I'd expect: \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Did I miss anything? Given the verification of exponents and my calculations, everything seems to align. It's always important to not skip the basics \u2014 they often hold the key! \n- It\u2019s good practice to revisit these rules when I encounter related questions, just as a refresher.\n\nThis systematic exploration and verification confirm that the expression \\((5^{-2})^0 + (5^0)^3\\) evaluates to 2.",
