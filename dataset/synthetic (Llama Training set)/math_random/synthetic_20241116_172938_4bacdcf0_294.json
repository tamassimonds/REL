    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. Our goal is to find the eighth term of a geometric sequence that starts with the terms \\(3\\), \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{27}{4}\\), and \\(\\frac{81}{8}\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Sequence\nFirst thoughts: When I see a sequence that involves fractions and powers, my mind jumps to geometric sequences where there's a consistent common ratio between terms.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nIt seems like each term can be obtained from the previous one through multiplication by some consistent number. \n- The first term is \\(a_1 = 3\\).\n- The second term is \\(a_2 = \\frac{9}{2}\\).\n\nInitially, the approach is to find the ratio between these two terms. Let's try dividing the second term by the first:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{2}}{3} = \\frac{9}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{9}{6} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis suggests the common ratio \\(r\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Common Ratio\nTo be sure, let's check that the ratio holds for the subsequent terms.\n\n- The third term \\(a_3 = \\frac{27}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\frac{\\frac{27}{4}}{\\frac{9}{2}} = \\frac{27}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{27 \\times 2}{4 \\times 9} = \\frac{54}{36} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n- The fourth term \\(a_4 = \\frac{81}{8}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_4}{a_3} = \\frac{\\frac{81}{8}}{\\frac{27}{4}} = \\frac{81}{8} \\times \\frac{4}{27} = \\frac{81 \\times 4}{8 \\times 27} = \\frac{324}{216} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nGreat! It looks like the common ratio is consistently \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\n### Step 4: General Formula for the Terms\nIn a geometric sequence, any term \\(a_n\\) is given by the formula: \n\\[\na_n = a_1 \\times r^{n-1}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a_1\\) is the initial term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n### Step 5: Find the Eighth Term\nLet's calculate the eighth term using the formula:\n- \\(a_1 = 3\\)\n- \\(r = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n- \\(n = 8\\)\n\n\\[\na_8 = 3 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{7}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{7}\\)\nThis is a bit of arithmetic, let's do it step by step:\n\n1. \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4}\\)\n2. \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{27}{8}\\)\n3. \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{81}{16}\\)\n4. \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{243}{32}\\)\n5. \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{729}{64}\\)\n6. \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7 = \\frac{2187}{128}\\)\n\n### Step 7: Final Multiplication\nNow multiply by the first term:\n\n\\[\na_8 = 3 \\times \\frac{2187}{128} = \\frac{6561}{128}\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Simplify the Fraction\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{6561}{128}\\), since 6561 is \\(3^8\\) and 128 is \\(2^7\\), they share no common factors. Thus:\n\n\\[\na_8 = \\frac{6561}{128}\n\\]\n\nThus, the eighth term of the sequence is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{6561}{128}}\\).\n\nThis feels correct as each step of the multiplication matched the expected growth, and our verification showed consistency. The calculation seems to confirm a long series of precise multiplications reflecting the geometric sequence behavior, cementing our understanding of how the sequence was formed.",
