    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: \\( z^3 = -8 \\). \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see this, I think it looks like finding roots for a complex number. The equation \\( z^3 = -8 \\) is essentially asking for the cube roots of \\(-8\\). I recognize that \\(-8\\) can be expressed as a complex number in polar form, which might simplify finding the roots.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Direct Cube Root**: I realize that finding the real cube root of \\(-8\\), which is \\(-2\\), is immediate. But I suspect there might be complex solutions as well, since I am dealing with complex numbers. \n\n2. **Polar Form Method**: It reminds me of the roots of unity and using De Moivre's Theorem. I have a faint memory that handling negative numbers as complex numbers could help. Perhaps converting \\(-8\\) to polar form could be a good start.\n\n3. **Consider the Complex Plane**: The cube root of a number will often have multiple solutions when considered in the complex plane. I expect three roots here due to the exponent '3'.\n\n### Converting \\(-8\\) to Polar Form\n\n- The number \\(-8\\) can be expressed as \\(-8 + 0i\\).\n- To convert this into polar form: \n  - The magnitude \\( r \\) is \\( |z| = \\sqrt{(-8)^2 + 0^2} = 8 \\).\n  - The argument \\(\\theta\\) for \\(-8\\) is \\(\\pi\\) because the line from the origin to \\(-8\\) is on the negative real axis.\n  \nThus, \\(-8\\) in polar form is \\(8(\\cos \\pi + i\\sin \\pi)\\).\n\n### Applying De Moivre\u2019s Theorem\n\nTo find the cube roots, we use De Moivre's Theorem: If \\( z = r(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta) \\), then the \\( n \\)-th roots are given by:\n\n\\[ z_k = \\sqrt[3]{r} \\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta + 2k\\pi}{3}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta + 2k\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right), \\]\nwhere \\( k = 0, 1, 2 \\).\n\nFor this problem:\n- \\( r = 8 \\), so \\( \\sqrt[3]{r} = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2 \\).\n- \\( \\theta = \\pi \\).\n\n### Calculating Each Root\n\n1. **For \\( k = 0 \\):**\n   \\[\n   z_0 = 2 \\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right) = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = 1 + i\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. **For \\( k = 1 \\):**\n   \\[\n   z_1 = 2 \\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi + 2\\pi}{3}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi + 2\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right) = 2 \\left(\\cos\\left(\\pi\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\pi\\right)\\right) = -2 + 0i\n   \\]\n\n3. **For \\( k = 2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   z_2 = 2 \\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi + 4\\pi}{3}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi + 4\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right) = 2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = -1 - i\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n### Reflection and Quick Check\n\n- Revisiting the real cube root I initially thought of, \\(-2\\), corresponds to the \\(z_1\\) root. That's correct and expected.\n- The roots \\(1 + i\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(-1 - i\\sqrt{3}\\) make sense in symmetry around the unit circle when translated through \\(2\\).\n\nThe solutions: \\(z_0 = 1 + i\\sqrt{3}\\), \\(z_1 = -2\\), and \\(z_2 = -1 - i\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nThe problem checks out as a complex roots problem, and introducing polar form was indeed the best approach for completeness. These solutions are confirmed to be correct!\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's take a closer look at the problem and correct it. My previous approach using the polar form and De Moivre\u2019s Theorem was a good way to find the complex roots of such an equation, but I must have made a mistake in calculating or interpreting the results. \n\nLet's re-evaluate the situation:\n\n### Reflection and Re-evaluation\n\n1. **Rechecking the Real Root**: Initially, I identified \\(-2\\) as one of the roots, which matches with any methodical approach to such problems. This was correct.\n\n2. **Re-thinking Complex Roots**: The part that needs correction is identifying the other two complex roots. I found \\(1 + i\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(-1 - i\\sqrt{3}\\), which upon reflection might not have been correctly derived or interpreted from the polar form process.\n\n3. **Trying out another Approach**: I\u2019ll explore this using the algebraic factorization method by looking at how a given cubic expression can be decomposed. Often, finding one solution can help factor the equation to find others.\n\n### Algebraic Factorization Approach\n\nGiven \\(z^3 = -8\\), which re-arranges to:\n\n\\[ z^3 + 8 = 0. \\]\n\nWe see that \\(z = -2\\) is indeed a solution. Hence, \\((z + 2)\\) is a factor. To explore further, I can divide the cubic polynomial by this factor:\n\n\\[ (z + 2)(z^2 - 2z + 4) = 0. \\]\n\nThe quadratic part, \\(z^2 - 2z + 4\\), needs solving to find the remaining roots. \n\n### Solving the Quadratic Equation\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \\]\nwhere \\( a = 1, b = -2, c = 4 \\):\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 4}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 16}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{-12}}{2}. \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{2 \\pm 2i\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}. \\]\n\n### Conclusion and Validation\n\nBy utilizing both polar form and algebraic techniques, the solutions to the equation are \\(-2, 1 + i\\sqrt{3},\\) and \\(1 - i\\sqrt{3}\\). This aligns with my revised understanding and checks out using a standard algebraic approach.\n\nThrough this exercise, I've reinforced the importance of double-checking calculations and considering multiple angles when approaching complex number problems.",
