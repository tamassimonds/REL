    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and break it down piece by piece. We'll start by gathering our initial thoughts.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nThe problem involves a quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) with right angles at \\(B\\) and \\(D\\), and one known diagonal \\(AC = 3\\). It also states that two sides of the quadrilateral are distinct integers, and we need to find the area of \\(ABCD\\). \n\nThis sounds like a peculiar quadrilateral, resembling the shape of a \"kite\" or an \"L\" with corners at \\(B\\) and \\(D\\). I've seen quadrilaterals where you can incorporate Pythagorean theorem or properties of right triangles to solve parts of the problem.\n\nLet\u2019s visualize it for clarity:\n```\n    C\n    /\\\n   /  \\\n  /    \\\n A------D\n  |    |\n  |    |\n  B---- \n```\nWe have right angles at \\(B\\) and \\(D\\). \n\n### Initial Thoughts and Hypotheses\n\nSince \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) are right angles, it suggests that \\(ABCD\\) might consist of two right triangles \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and \\(\\triangle ACD\\). \n\n**First Hypothesis**: If \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and \\(\\triangle ACD\\) share \\(AC\\), this diagonal might split \\(ABCD\\) into two triangles, where I can apply the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Second Hypothesis**: Another possibility is that there's some property that relates the areas of these triangles to give the total area of \\(ABCD\\) straightforwardly.\n\n**Exploration**: Start by setting variables for the sides. Suppose \\(AB = x\\) and \\(BC = y\\). Further assume \\(AD = z\\) and \\(CD = w\\), which look like reasonable labeling based on typical triangle conventions.\n\n### Considerations for Right Triangles\n- \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is right-angled at \\(B\\), so \\(AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\\).\n- \\(\\triangle ACD\\) is right-angled at \\(D\\), so \\(AC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2\\).\n\nPutting the known \\(AC = 3\\) gives us:  \n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = 3^2 = 9 \\]  \n\\[ z^2 + w^2 = 3^2 = 9 \\]\n\n### Distinct Integer Lengths Constraint\n\nTo satisfy the condition of distinct integer lengths, we first look for some Pythagorean triples where the hypotenuse is 3. Weird, isn't it? That's because small integers might not work\u2014hypotenuse usually exceeds integers except in specific small/big integers. \n\nOpen-minded Pause: \"Hold on a second, 3 seems small for an integer hypotenuse. Maybe both triangles don\u2019t individually have integer sides.\"\n\n**Insight**: Check if there's an integer combination that satisfies both equations simultaneously.\n\n### Breaking into Integer Triplet: \nLet's assume \\(AB\\) and \\(AD\\) are deterministic, or try distinct scenarios:\n\nTry setting distinct known sides for examples:\n\n#### Case Check:\n- \\(x = 0\\): Makes \\(y^2 = 9 \\Rightarrow y = 3\\). \n- \\(z = 3\\) and \\(w = 0\\).\n\nHmm, both instances only cover integer forces without much alterity.\n\nExplore a different manifestation of integer logic simplifying further:\n\n### Redrawing Visualization\nIf \\(AB = 1\\), then \\(BC^2 = 9 - 1 = 8\\), not perfect integer-friendly. And similarly for \\(AD = 2\\).\n\nTry intending towards mixed double pairs of:\n- Example: \\(x = 2\\), then \\(y^2 = 5\\) loses integer quality.\n- Consider the influence of non-primary \\(x, y, z, w\\).\n\n### Try Calculation Reflex\nTake different scenario tentatives to check the area:\n\nFor \\(x = 1, y = \\sqrt{8}\\). Now check another:\n- One can then conjecture \\(AD = 2\\), so check \\(CD = \\sqrt{5}\\).\n\nRealization: \"This arrangement seems feasible.\"\nUltimately, symptomless straight-friendly calculations give:\n- Total planned area half definition \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times diagonal \\times (sum of projections)\\).\n\nBridge hypothesis into likely quadratic expression workaround:\n\\[ Area_Speculate = \\frac{3 \\times 3}{2} = \\frac{9}{2} \\]\n\nThe measure synthesizes \"ah-Ha\" capturing correct logic of own projection:\n\n### Confirm Region Plot\nStepping through alternative geometrical compatibility deploy incremented label logic couples, perfecting simple analyzation by adhering to errors of fit leaves thoroughly reasonable.\n- Total quadrarily unwrapped afar reaching valid milestones, ascertain sup imclose \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\).\n\nUltimately Drivering:\n\\[ \\therefore \\text{Area of } ABCD = \\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]\n\nExplanation catalyzing the value: 'Oh wait, how vivid it's simpler if formulated quadratic surface relates fundamentally hence re-iterate mathematical harmony and computational kinship\u2019.\n\nSuch clearing, poised answers satisfy scrupulous construction. Fin.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an oversight in my previous attempt. It seems I went off track in searching for integer solutions for the sides of the triangles within quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\). Let's revisit the problem with a fresh perspective.\n\n### Revisiting the Problem\n\nWe have a quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) with right angles at \\(B\\) and \\(D\\), and the diagonal \\(AC = 3\\). We're tasked with determining the area of \\(ABCD\\), knowing that two of its sides have distinct integer lengths.\n\n### Breaking Down the Problem Again\n\nLet's rethink how the right triangles \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and \\(\\triangle ACD\\) are formed with their respective right angles and diagonal \\(AC\\). Both triangles share this diagonal:\n\n1. **For \\(\\triangle ABC\\):**\n   - Right angle at \\(B\\).\n   - \\(AC\\) acts as the hypotenuse: \\(AB^2 + BC^2 = 3^2 = 9\\).\n\n2. **For \\(\\triangle ACD\\):**\n   - Right angle at \\(D\\).\n   - \\(AC\\) acts as the hypotenuse: \\(AD^2 + DC^2 = 3^2 = 9\\).\n\n### Considering Integer Solutions\n\nI previously overlooked the possible integer lengths for the sides. This time, let's explore the feasible integral side lengths:\n\n1. **Examining \\(\\triangle ABC\\):**\n   - If \\(AB = 1\\), then \\(BC^2 = 9 - 1 = 8\\), giving \\(BC = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - If \\(AB = 2\\), then \\(BC^2 = 9 - 4 = 5\\), giving \\(BC = \\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n2. **Considering \\(\\triangle ACD\\):**\n   - If \\(AD = 1\\), then \\(DC^2 = 9 - 1 = 8\\), resulting in \\(DC = 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - If \\(AD = 2\\), then \\(DC^2 = 9 - 4 = 5\\), resulting in \\(DC = \\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n### Plausible Configuration \n\nAssuming:  \n- \\(AB = 1\\) and \\(BC = 2\\sqrt{2}\\)  \n- \\(AD = 2\\) and \\(DC = \\sqrt{5}\\)\n\nThese choices satisfy the constraint of integer side lengths among the quadrilateral's sides.\n\n### Calculating the Area of \\(ABCD\\)\n\nSince diagonal \\(AC\\) divides \\(ABCD\\) into two right triangles, we compute their individual areas and sum them:\n\n- **Area of \\(\\triangle ABC\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\times BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 2\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Area of \\(\\triangle ACD\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AD \\times DC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times \\sqrt{5} = \\sqrt{5}\n  \\]\n\n- **Total Area of Quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Area} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{5}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the area of quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{5}}\\).\n\nThis re-evaluation aligns perfectly with logical deduction about the distinct integer lengths and forms a coherent geometrical solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Triangles $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle ADC$ are both right and share hypotenuse $AC$, which has length $3$. Thus we have $$AB^2+BC^2 = AD^2+DC^2 = 3^2 = 9.$$The only possible integer values for $AB,$ $BC,$ $AD,$ or $DC$ are $1$ and $2$. Thus we may assume that one leg of $\\triangle ABC$ has length $1$ and one leg of $\\triangle ADC$ has length $2$ (it doesn't matter if the labels $B$ and $D$ have to be swapped to make this true).\n\nIf one leg of $\\triangle ABC$ has length $1,$ then the other leg has length $\\sqrt{3^2-1^2} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. If one leg of $\\triangle ADC$ has length $2,$ then the other leg has length $\\sqrt{3^2-2^2}= \\sqrt{5}$. Thus, quadrilateral $ABCD$ is divided by its diagonal $AC$ into right triangles of area $\\frac{1\\cdot2\\sqrt 2}{2}=\\sqrt 2$ and $\\frac{2\\cdot\\sqrt 5}{2}=\\sqrt 5$. So, the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt 2+\\sqrt 5}$."
