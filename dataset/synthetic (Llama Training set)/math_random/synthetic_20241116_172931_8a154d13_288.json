    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and work through it step by step. \n\nFirst Thoughts:\nWhen I see the problem, my initial thought is to understand the range we're dealing with. We're looking for even numbers that are greater than 202 and less than 405. So, I immediately think about what even numbers are and how I can efficiently count them within this range. Even numbers are integers divisible by 2, so our task is to find how many such numbers exist.\n\nUnderstanding the Question:\nWe need to find out how many even numbers exist between two specific numbers: 202 and 405. This involves listing or calculating all even numbers within this interval and counting them. Immediate thoughts are to either list them out or develop a formula to find how many there are without listing.\n\nStrategy Brainstorm:\n1. Listing Method: I could manually list each even number starting from the first even number greater than 202 up to the largest even number less than 405, then count them.\n\n2. Mathematical Approach: Alternately, find the first even number greater than 202 and the last even number less than 405, then use the properties of arithmetic sequences to determine the count.\n\nDecision: I think the mathematical approach will be more efficient and less prone to error than listing, especially if we have a large range.\n\nMathematical Approach Breakdown:\n1. **Find the first and last even numbers in the range:**\n   - Starting Point: Since 202 is even, the next even number greater than 202 is 204.\n   - Ending Point: Since 405 is odd, the largest even number less than 405 is 404.\n\n2. **Confirming the Range:**\n   - 204 is indeed the first even number greater than 202.\n   - 404 is indeed the last even number less than 405.\n   - Great, this makes sense.\n\n3. **Counting Even Numbers:**\n   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence, where the first term (a_1) is 204 and the last term is 404 with a common difference of 2.\n   - To find the number of terms (n) in this sequence, use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n     \\]\n     where \\( a_n \\) is the last term (404), \\( a_1 \\) is the first term (204), and \\( d \\) is 2.\n\n   \\[\n   404 = 204 + (n-1) \\times 2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   404 = 204 + 2n - 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   404 = 202 + 2n\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   202 = 2n\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{202}{2} = 101\n   \\]\n\nCheck and Reflect:\nHmm, at first glance, 101 seems a bit large. Let's double-check:\n\n- Quick Check: Dividing the two numbers first: \n  The first term is 204 and the last is 404. The difference of 404 and 204 is 200.\n  Since there\u2019s an even number every 2 integers, divide 200 by 2: \n  \\[\n  \\frac{200}{2} = 100\n  \\]\n- However, considering there's one extra step from 204 to start counting, it indeed confirms that 101 is correct - there are 101 even numbers.\n\nFinal Reflection: My initial impression of 101 seemed off because I didn't fully account for the structure of the sequence on paper. It\u2019s correct after verification.\n\nConclusion:\nThe total number of even numbers between 202 and 405 is 101. This approach confirmed the mathematical integrity, and back-checking ensures correctness. The brainstorming and adjustments allowed us to refine our strategy effectively.",

  "ground_truth": "The first even integer that is greater than $202$ is $204$, and the last even integer that is less than $405$ is $404$. So, the even numbers we must count are \\[2\\cdot 102, 2\\cdot 103, 2\\cdot 104, \\ldots, 2\\cdot 202.\\]  Counting the numbers in this list is the same as counting the numbers in the list \\[102, 103, 104, \\ldots, 202.\\] Subtracting 101 from each gives  \\[1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 101,\\] so there are $\\boxed{101}$ numbers."
