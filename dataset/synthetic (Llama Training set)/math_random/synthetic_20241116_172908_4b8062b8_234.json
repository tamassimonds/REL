    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll write down my thoughts and approach as if I'm in the midst of solving this myself. Here we go:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nFirst, let's clarify what's being asked. We're looking for a point \\( P \\) such that the sum of distances \\((PA + PD)\\) equals 8, and also the sum \\((PB + PC)\\) equals 8. We need to find the \\( y \\)-coordinate of \\( P \\) expressed in a certain form.\n\n**Initial Thoughts**: This problem resembles an ellipse definition\u2014sum of distances from two fixed points\u2014but here it\u2019s split between two pairs. I feel like we should be thinking of some kind of symmetry or reflection.\n\n### Step 2: Setting up coordinates and equations\nThe points \\( A(-3, 0) \\), \\( B(-2, 1) \\), \\( C(2, 1) \\), \\( D(3, 0) \\) are given. Let's visualize this: Points A and D are horizontally aligned on the x-axis, while B and C are above them and also horizontally aligned.\n\nGiven conditions:\n- \\( PA + PD = 8 \\)\n- \\( PB + PC = 8 \\)\n\nLet's start by expressing these distance conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Express PA + PD\nThe distance \\( PA \\) is \\( \\sqrt{(x + 3)^2 + y^2} \\) and \\( PD \\) is \\( \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + y^2} \\). Setting their sum:\n\\[ \\sqrt{(x+3)^2 + y^2} + \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + y^2} = 8. \\]\n\n### Step 4: Express PB + PC\nSimilarly, \\( PB \\) is \\( \\sqrt{(x + 2)^2 + (y-1)^2} \\) and \\( PC \\) is \\( \\sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + (y-1)^2} \\). Their condition:\n\\[ \\sqrt{(x+2)^2 + (y-1)^2} + \\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (y-1)^2} = 8. \\]\n\n### Step 5: Consider Symmetry and Analyze Conditions\nHmm, this gives me the feeling that \\( P \\) might be along some symmetry line due to equal distances. Reflections maybe, or direct alignments. Notice how \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) being symmetric about the y-axis could simplify analysis. Similarly, points \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) also suggest y-axis symmetry for \\( P \\).\n\n### Step 6: Symmetry Implication\nGiven the symmetry and the equal summations:\n- \\( P \\) might either lie along the y-axis (\\( x = 0 \\)) or along the lines that maintain those sums.\n\nLet's try \\( x = 0 \\) and see if it works and simplifies equations:\nIf \\( x = 0 \\):\n- \\( PA + PD = \\sqrt{9 + y^2} + \\sqrt{9 + y^2} = 2\\sqrt{9 + y^2} = 8 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{9 + y^2} = 4 \\Rightarrow y^2 = 7 \\Rightarrow y = \\sqrt{7} \\text{ or } -\\sqrt{7}. \\)\n\nIf \\( x = 0 \\), checking the condition for \\( B \\) and \\( C \\):\n- \\( PB + PC = \\sqrt{4 + (y-1)^2} + \\sqrt{4 + (y-1)^2} = 8 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{4 + (y-1)^2} = 4 \\Rightarrow 4 + (y-1)^2 = 16 \\Rightarrow (y-1)^2 = 12 \\Rightarrow y-1 = \\sqrt{12} \\Rightarrow y = 1 + 2\\sqrt{3}. \\)\n\n### Step 7: Intersection of Solutions\nHmm, we need both to hold, so what if we consider possible intersection points?\n\nLet's reconcile the value logic given expressions:\nBoth conditions seem to express \\(y\\) at different solutions rebased from symmetry or algebraic form.\n\nI\u2019m noticing a symmetry solution candidate here possibly converging:\nLet's rewrite \\( y = \\frac{-1 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{1} \\) given potential for reconciliations to \\(\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{28}}{2} \\) examining above utilizations:\nGiven \\( y^2 = 7 \\) for one vector, reflecting symmetry can transform and contort potential vectors.\n\n### Step 8: Conclude by observing fit\nReflecting on possible \\( \\boxed{\\frac{-1 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{1}} \\), since this format seemed plausible and aligns conditions in written forms being symmetrical from restructuring coordinates and resolving any deviation.\n\nThus, adding terms compacted from separate forms potentially makes \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7 \\)\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\] being an inferred matched logical synthesis of kernel and constancy.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous approach. Let's go through this again and try to find where my reasoning went astray. I initially attempted to solve the problem by assuming symmetry and estimating potential positions of point \\( P \\). Let's reassess this method and consider a more structured approach by intersecting the conditions as given by the problem.\n\n### Revisiting the Problem\nThe user problem states:\n- We have coordinates \\( A = (-3, 0), \\) \\( B = (-2, 1), \\) \\( C = (2, 1), \\) \\( D = (3, 0) \\).\n- The point \\( P \\) must satisfy the conditions \\( PA + PD = 8 \\) and \\( PB + PC = 8 \\).\n- We're searching for the \\( y \\)-coordinate in a specific form.\n\n### Step 1: Re-evaluate with an Analytical Approach\nI initially tried symmetry assumptions and direct computation using specific values for \\( x \\), but that approach didn't yield a coherent solution. Instead, let's try setting up the problem using the properties of ellipses since the conditions remind us of them.\n\n### Step 2: Set up as Elliptical Equations\n**Ellipse from \\( PA + PD = 8 \\):**\n\n- \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) are foci: \n  - Center at \\( (0,0) \\) and distances between foci as \\( 6 \\).\n  - The major axis length of this ellipse is \\( 8 \\).\n  - Thus, \\( c = 3, \\) and we use \\( a = 4 \\) for the semi-major axis.\n  - The semi-minor axis \\( b = \\sqrt{a^2 - c^2} = \\sqrt{16 - 9} = \\sqrt{7} \\).\n  - The equation becomes: \\(\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{7} = 1\\).\n\n**Ellipse from \\( PB + PC = 8 \\):**\n\n- \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) as foci:\n  - Center at \\( (0,1) \\) with foci distance \\( 4 \\).\n  - Major axis length \\( 8 \\), hence \\( c = 2 \\) and \\( a = 4 \\).\n  - The semi-minor axis \\( b = \\sqrt{16 - 4} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3} \\).\n  - Equation: \\(\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{(y-1)^2}{12} = 1\\).\n\n### Step 3: Solve for Intersection\nGiven \\( P \\) lies on both ellipses, equate the \\( y \\)-components:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y^2}{7} = \\frac{(y-1)^2}{12}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiply and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n12y^2 = 7(y^2 - 2y + 1)\n\\]\n\nSolving:\n\n\\[\n12y^2 = 7y^2 - 14y + 7\n\\]\n\\[\n5y^2 + 14y - 7 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Use the quadratic formula**:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{14^2 - 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot (-7)}}{10}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{196 + 140}}{10} = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{336}}{10} = \\frac{-7 \\pm 2\\sqrt{21}}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify and Choose Correct \\( y \\)-value\nGiven the correct form for \\( y \\) as \\(\\frac{-a + b \\sqrt{c}}{d}\\), validate both choices:\n- Since the negative root leads to an impractical value (below the minimum y on the ellipse \\(\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{7} = 1\\)), we choose positive:\n  \n\\[ y = \\frac{-7 + 2\\sqrt{21}}{5} \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the \\( y \\)-coordinate is in the form required, and we find \\( a = 7, b = 2, c = 21, d = 5 \\), leading to:\n\n\\[ a + b + c + d = 7 + 2 + 21 + 5 = \\boxed{35} \\]\n\nUpon reviewing and recalculating, I see now that my initial conclusions were based on incorrect assumptions. This thorough understanding of ellipses led directly to the accurate \\( y \\)-coordinate needed.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $PA + PD = 8,$ point $P$ must lie on the ellipse whose foci are $A$ and $D,$ and whose major axis has length $8.$ Since the distance between the foci is $3 - (-3) = 6,$ the minor axis has length $\\sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = 2\\sqrt{7}.$ Then the semi-axes have lengths $4$ and $\\sqrt{7},$ respectively, and the center of the ellipse is $(0,0),$ so the equation of this ellipse is \\[\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{7} = 1.\\]Similarly, since $PB+PC=8,$ point $P$ must lie on the ellipse whose foci are $B$ and $C,$ and whose major axis has length $8.$ Since the distance between the foci is $2-(-2) = 4,$ the minor axis has length $\\sqrt{8^2-4^2} = 4\\sqrt{3}.$ Then the semi-axes have lengths $4$ and $2\\sqrt{3},$ respectively, and the center of the ellipse is $(0,1),$ so the equation of this ellipse is \\[\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{(y-1)^2}{12} = 1.\\]Both ellipses are shown below.

Since $\\sqrt{21} > 4,$ we have \\[\\frac{-7 - 2\\sqrt{21}}{5} < \\frac{-7 -2 \\cdot 4}{5} = -3.\\]But the smallest possible value of $y$ for a point on the ellipse $\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{7} = 1$ is $-\\sqrt{7},$ which is greater than $-3.$ Therefore, we must choose the $+$ sign, and so \\[y = \\frac{-7 + 2\\sqrt{21}}{5}.\\]The final answer is $7 + 2 + 21 + 5 = \\boxed{35}.$"
