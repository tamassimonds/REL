    "working_out": "Alright, let's take a look at simplifying \\(\\sqrt{180}\\). I'll start by brainstorming the problem and considering different strategies.\n\n### Initial thoughts:\n- When I see \\(\\sqrt{180}\\), I instantly think of simplifying square roots using prime factorization or identifying perfect squares within the radical.\n- I've done similar problems before and recall breaking the number inside the square root into smaller factors can help.\n- Although I know some shortcuts, I'll try the primary method of prime factorization to be thorough.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization\n- First, consider the number 180:\n  - It's an even number, so divisible by 2: \\(180 \\div 2 = 90\\)\n  - 90 is also even, so divide by 2: \\(90 \\div 2 = 45\\)\n  - 45 isn't divisible by 2 but by 3 (since \\(4 + 5 = 9\\) is divisible by 3): \\(45 \\div 3 = 15\\)\n  - Again, 15 is divisible by 3: \\(15 \\div 3 = 5\\)\n  - 5 is a prime number.\n  \n- So, the prime factorization of 180 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Square Root\n- Using the factorization: \\(\\sqrt{180} = \\sqrt{2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5}\\).\n- I notice that \\(2^2\\) and \\(3^2\\) are perfect squares and can be pulled out of the square root.\n- \\(\\sqrt{2^2} = 2\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\).\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Simplification\n- Now, apply the square root to the factored terms: \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{2^2} \\times \\sqrt{3^2} \\times \\sqrt{5} = 2 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5}\n  \\]\n- Simplifying further: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\), so the expression becomes \\(6\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n### Check and Reflection\n- Let me do a quick check to ensure everything feels right:\n  - The original number \\(180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\) splits into perfect squares and a leftover, which matches what I found.\n  - Since 6 squared (plus times 5) should get us back to 180, reflect that \\(6^2 \\times 5 = 36 \\times 5 = 180\\).\n\n- Upon reflecting, yes, everything checks out and the simplification seems sound.\n\n### Conclusion\n- \\(\\sqrt{180}\\) simplifies to \\(6\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\nSo, through factorization and square root extraction, it seems I've solved it correctly. It wasn\u2019t too tricky but required careful attention to detail when handling the factors.",
