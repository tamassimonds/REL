    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to find the perimeter of one of the four congruent rectangles in this larger square. At first glance, I know there's a big outer square with side length \\(y\\) and somewhere inside it is a smaller square of side length \\(x\\). The rest of the square is divided into these four rectangles. That setup reminds me of some puzzles I've dealt with before, where knowing just a couple of measurements helped crack the whole thing open.\n\nStrategic thinking:\n\n1. We need to remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated with the formula \\(P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\\).\n\n2. Since we're dealing with congruent rectangles, I believe if I can find the dimensions of one rectangle, the perimeter will be straightforward.\n\n3. I notice the key here is to express everything (especially the rectangle sides) in terms of \\(y\\) only, as the problem requests that. So, something is running in my mind saying: I need to think about how \\(y\\) relates to \\(x\\) and those rectangle sides.\n\nFiguring out the geometry:\n\nWait, let's take a step back and stare at that image conceptually. Here's what it's saying:\n- The big square's side is \\(y\\).\n- The small square inside is \\(x\\).\n- The rest consists of four equal rectangles fitting around \\(x\\).\n\nOh! Maybe I should consider how these rectangles enclose or cluster around the small square in a systematic way.\n\nVisualizing it more clearly:\n\nNow, let's piece the layout together. Placing a smaller square of side \\(x\\) in a larger square of side \\(y\\) divides the big square into the small square at the corner with rectangles around it. \n\nThe other dimensions of these rectangles come from what's left after considering the small square:\n- Alongside \\(x\\), there must be a gap of \\(y-x\\) to make up the complete length of \\(y\\). \n- This means one side of a rectangle is \\(x\\) and the same logic applies to the width: \\(y-x\\).\n\nOkay! This seems right:\nThe rectangle's dimensions would be \\(x\\) for one side and \\(y-x\\) for the other.\n\nCalculating the Perimeter:\n\nDefinitely, it's time for mathematics with clarity:\n- The perimeter of one rectangle is \\(2 \\times (x + (y-x)) = 2 \\times (x + y-x) = 2 \\times y\\).\n\nChecking our logic:\n\nIt looks reasonable that in this symmetrical and evenly split geometry, if both composed parts sum precisely to the complete length \\(y\\), then yes, the final formulation means the rectangle encircles compactly with those sides. So each rectangle\u2019s perimeter indeed simplifies just to \\(2y\\).\n\nSo, there we have it. The perimeter of one of those four congruent rectangles is indeed \\(2y\\) units.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $l$ represent the longer side of the rectangle, which makes the shorter side of the rectangle $y-l$ (since one long side and one short side make up $y$). Then the perimeter of one of the rectangles is $2l+2(y-l)=2l+2y-2l=\\boxed{2y}$."
