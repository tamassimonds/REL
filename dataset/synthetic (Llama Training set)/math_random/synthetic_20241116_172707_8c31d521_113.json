    "working_out": "Alright, let's jump into this problem step-by-step and truly dive into our thought process:\n\n### First Thoughts: \n\n- At first glance, this problem asks for the area of a triangle given its vertices on the Cartesian coordinate plane. I feel like I've encountered similar problems before\u2014maybe involving coordinate geometry methods, like the Shoelace Theorem or maybe using basic geometric principles. \n\n- The vertices given are (5, -2), (10, 5), and (5, 5). The first thing that comes to mind is that two of these points, (5, -2) and (5, 5), have the same x-coordinate. That seems significant.\n\n### Exploring Options:\n\n1. **Shoelace Theorem Approach:**\n   \n   - The Shoelace Theorem (or Gauss's area formula for polygons) relates directly to the coordinates of the vertices, so it seems like a solid option. It's usually quite reliable for these types of problems.\n\n2. **Basic Triangle Area Formation:**\n\n   - Another approach could easily involve seeing if this is a right triangle, given the repeating x-coordinate, which often happens. Using the basic formula for the area of a triangle: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\).\n\n### Initial Calculations:\n\n#### 1. Shoelace Theorem Calculation\n\n- The formula is: \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} | x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_1) | \\)\n\n- Plugging in the given coordinates: \n\n    - \\( x_1 = 5, y_1 = -2 \\)\n    - \\( x_2 = 10, y_2 = 5 \\)\n    - \\( x_3 = 5, y_3 = 5 \\)\n\n- Substitute these into the formula:\n  \n    \\[\n    \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot | 5 \\cdot 5 + 10 \\cdot 5 + 5 \\cdot (-2) - (-2 \\cdot 10 + 5 \\cdot 5 + 5 \\cdot 5) |\n    \\]\n\n    \\[\n    = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot | 25 + 50 - 10 + 20 - 25 - 25 |\n    \\]\n\n    \\[\n    = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot | 65 - 30 |\n    \\]\n\n    \\[\n    = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 35 = 17.5\n    \\]\n\n- This leads to an area of **17.5 square units**.\n\n#### 2. Checking if it is a Right Triangle:\n\n - With points (5, -2), (5, 5), and (10, 5), notice that (5, 5) is vertically above (5, -2) by 7 units (the base). The point (10, 5) is horizontally 5 units away from (5, 5) (the height). If it's a right triangle, this makes it simple:\n\n    \\[\n    \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 7 \\times 5 = 17.5\n    \\]\n\n### Reflection and Verification:\n\n- Both methods confirm the area as 17.5 square units. It feels correct as both calculations matched.\n\n- Double-checking helps solidify confidence in results, especially noting the logical assumptions about perpendicularity due to coordinate alignment.\n\nIn conclusion, the area of the triangle is **17.5 square units**. This flowed nicely through both the Shoelace Theorem and confirming the right triangle hypothesis, verifying our calculations and thought process.",
