    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and try to break it down step by step. I'm going to begin by understanding what's being asked and exploring the problem from different angles to find an effective strategy.\n\n**First thoughts**:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves an infinite series on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have the product of two infinite series, and on the right side, an infinite geometric series. Our goal is to find the value of \\( x \\) that makes the equation hold.\n\n2. **Series Familiarity**: The series on the right-hand side, \\( 1 + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2} + \\cdots \\), is a geometric series that should converge to a finite number. If I remember correctly, the sum of an infinite geometric series \\( a + ar + ar^2 + \\cdots \\) is \\( \\frac{a}{1-r} \\), provided \\( |r| < 1 \\). Here, \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( r = \\frac{1}{x} \\).\n\n3. **Different Elements**: The terms on the left (two series being multiplied) stand out. The first series, \\( 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\cdots \\), looks like a geometric series with common ratio \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Summing that up should be straightforward, but I'll pay more attention to the second series since it alternates in sign.\n\n4. **Breaking Down the Left Side**: Let's delve into those series more deeply.\n\n**Step-by-step exploration**:\n\n- **Left Side - First Series**: \n  \\[\n  1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\cdots\n  \\]\n  This is a geometric series with \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( r = \\frac{1}{2} \\). The sum \\( S \\) is:\n  \\[\n  S = \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\n  \\]\n\n- **Left Side - Second Series**: \n  \\[\n  1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{8} + \\cdots\n  \\]\n  This again looks like a geometric series but with alternating signs, which means \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( r = -\\frac{1}{2} \\). The sum \\( T \\) is:\n  \\[\n  T = \\frac{1}{1 - (-\\frac{1}{2})} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n  \\]\n\n- **Multiplying the Two Series**: The problem asks us to multiply these two results (as the two are inside one set of parentheses):\n  \\[\n  2 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\n  \\]\n\n- **Right Side and Finding \\( x \\)**:\n  \\[\n  1 + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2} + \\frac{1}{x^3} + \\cdots\n  \\]\n  is a geometric series with first term \\( 1 \\) and ratio \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\). We set the sums equal:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{x}} = \\frac{4}{3}\n  \\]\n\n  Solving for \\( x \\):\n  \\[\n  1 - \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{3}{4} \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{x} = 1 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}\n  \\]\n  Thus, \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n**Checking and Reflection**:\nI went through each step carefully to ensure correctness. The sums and calculations of geometric series were double-checked, and they align well with the properties of geometric progressions. Revisiting the multiplications verified that the process was accurate. The solution makes logical sense: \\( x = 4 \\) is indeed consistent with the constraints and structure presented by the original equation.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the given equation is \\( x = 4 \\).",

Thus the sum of the first series is\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}$$And the sum of the second series is\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{2}}$$Multiplying these, we get\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2}=\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{4}}$$So $x=\\boxed{4}$."
