    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. We're looking for the smallest positive four-digit multiple of \\(15\\). \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- The problem requires finding a number that meets two criteria: it must be a four-digit number, and it must be a multiple of 15.\n- A number is a multiple of 15 if it can be divided evenly by both 3 and 5. That sparks a memory: divisibility rules! This seems like a classic problem for applying those rules.\n\n**Divisibility Rules Refresh and Initial Ideas:**\n\n1. **Divisibility by 5**: The number must end in 0 or 5.\n2. **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of a number's digits must be a multiple of 3.\n\nHmm, I have a feeling that the condition of divisibility by 5 will guide us faster because of its distinct pattern of ending digits\u2014and given that 5 and 0 are possible ending digits.\n\n**First Attempts and Rough Calculations:**\n\n- Wait, let's start from the beginning of the range for four-digit numbers. Four-digit numbers start at 1000. How about starting with numbers ending in 0, as they will also make it easier to check for a sum of digits?\n\n1. **Starting with 1000**: \n   - Ends with 0, so divisible by 5. \u2714\ufe0f\n   - Sum of digits: \\(1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1\\), which is not divisible by 3. \u2717\n   - Okay, that doesn't work. Also, that's quite far from being divisible by 3 if just one! We should step up.\n\n2. **Next candidate starting with 1005:**\n   - Ends with 5, so divisible by 5. \u2714\ufe0f\n   - Sum of digits: \\(1 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 6\\), divisible by 3. \u2714\ufe0f\n   - Let's check manually: \\(1005 \\div 15 = 67\\), which is a whole number, confirming that it is indeed a multiple of 15.\n\n**Reflecting on the Approach:**\n\n- Given the pattern, starting from 1000 directly and relying on the structure to guide checks worked without needing heavier calculation.\n- Ending with 0 will also ensure that jumps in digits maintain divisibility by 5, but starting with the smallest, 1000, and making smaller jumps ensured catching necessary conditions early.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- I've gone through my steps again, noting divisibility by both individual prime factors.\n- The math checked out both through sum properties and division itself verified \\(1005\\) as indeed a multiple of 15.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The smallest positive four-digit multiple of 15 is \\(1005\\).\n- All conditions align, and the approach was validated through simple, clear logic of divisibility shortcut checks and numeric verification.\n\nI feel confident in this solution, and there's both logical soundness and numeric verification to back it up\u2014nice!",

  "ground_truth": "Dividing $1000$ by $15$ gives a quotient of $66$ with a remainder of $10.$ In other words, \\[1000=15\\cdot66+10.\\]So, $66\\cdot15$ is the largest three-digit multiple of $15,$ and $67\\cdot15=\\boxed{1005}$ is the smallest four-digit multiple."
