    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through step by step. At first glance, the problem involves inequalities and rational functions, so some careful algebraic manipulation will likely be involved. Here's my thinking process:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\n**First Impressions**: We're dealing with an inequality involving rational expressions. This reminds me of some subtraction of fractions problems I've seen before.\n\n**Objective**: Find all real values of \\(x\\) such that \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x(x+1)} - \\frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)} < \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reactions**: Okay, both expressions involve products of terms that share a common factor, \\(x+1\\). This suggests that combining the fractions might simplify things.\n\n### Step 2: Combine Fractions\n\n**Next Steps**: Let's try to combine the two fractions on the left side. We'll need a common denominator.\n\n- The denominators are \\(x(x+1)\\) and \\((x+1)(x+2)\\).\n- The least common denominator is \\(x(x+1)(x+2)\\).\n\n**Combine the Fractions**:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x(x+1)} - \\frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)} = \\frac{(x+2) - x}{x(x+1)(x+2)} = \\frac{2}{x(x+1)(x+2)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Set Up the Inequality\n\nNow, our inequality becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{x(x+1)(x+2)} < \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n**Strategy Thoughts**: To solve this inequality, it's often useful to clear the fractions by multiplying through by the denominator, while being mindful of the sign since it might affect the inequality direction.\n\n### Step 4: Eliminate the Fraction\n\n**Make Both Sides Have a Common Denominator**:\n\\[\n6 < x(x+1)(x+2).\n\\]\n\n**Check Assumptions**: Let's make sure this multiplication is valid by considering the domain. \n- Note the critical points where the denominator could be zero: \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = -1\\), and \\(x = -2\\).\n- These represent values where the expression is undefined.\n\n### Step 5: Solve the Inequality\n\n**Factor**: The expression simplifies to \n\\[\nx(x+1)(x+2) > 6.\n\\]\n\n**Look at Intervals**: To solve the inequality, explore function behavior over intervals separated by critical points:\n- **Interval Testing**: Consider test points in intervals determined by the roots \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = -1\\), \\(x = -2\\).\n  \n### Step 6: Analyze Intervals\n\n**Consider the following intervals**:\n1. \\( x < -2 \\)\n2. \\( -2 < x < -1 \\)\n3. \\( -1 < x < 0 \\)\n4. \\( x > 0 \\)\n\n**Evaluate Each Case**: \n\n1. **\\( x < -2 \\)**: Pick \\(x = -3\\), then \\(x(x+1)(x+2) = -3 \\cdot (-2) \\cdot (-1) = -6\\); hence, not valid.\n2. **\\( -2 < x < -1 \\)**: Pick \\(x = -1.5\\), approximate computation shows a value less than 6, again not valid.\n3. **\\( -1 < x < 0 \\)**: Pick \\(x = -0.5\\), approximate computation shows a value less than 6, still not valid.\n4. **\\( x > 0 \\)**: Pick \\(x = 1\\), then \\(x(x+1)(x+2) = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\); try a larger \\(x\\) for a result greater than \\(6\\), e.g., \\(x = 2\\) gives \\(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 24 > 6\\), valid here.\n\n**Verify**: Further narrow down interval by \\(x > 0\\), implies real interconnected solutions.\n  \n### Conclusion\n\nPutting it together, the solution interval is:\n\\[\nx \\in (2, \\infty).\n\\]\n\nThis feels right because we've checked the behavior of the inequality across critical points and intervals.\n\n**Reflect**: The process involved clarifying denominators, rearranging terms, and understanding the form of the inequality. The approach pivoted when needed, especially when checking whether the solution intervals matched logical expectations.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's take a closer look and rethink it step by step. The initial approach was to consider the intervals based on the factors in the product, but I realize that I didn't fully explore the implications of the inequality transformation. Let's break it down again.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\n**Objective Recap**: We want to find the real values of \\(x\\) such that \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x(x+1)} - \\frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)} < \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Revisiting the Algebraic Manipulation\n\nAfter re-evaluating the process, we start by moving all terms to the left-hand side:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x(x+1)} - \\frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)} - \\frac{1}{3} < 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Common Denominator\n\nLet's redo this by ensuring we get this step right:\n- The common denominator is \\(3x(x+1)(x+2)\\).\n- Combine the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{3(x+2) - 3x - x(x+1)(x+2)}{3x(x+1)(x+2)} < 0,\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{6 - x(x+1)(x+2)}{3x(x+1)(x+2)} < 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factoring the Numerator\n\nI notice \\(x = 1\\) makes the numerator zero, implying \\(x-1\\) is a factor. Let's factor it with polynomial division:\n\nPerforming polynomial division, we find:\n\\[\n6 - x(x+1)(x+2) = -(x-1)(x^2 + 4x + 6).\n\\]\n\nRe-evaluating, the inequality becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{(x-1)(x^2 + 4x + 6)}{x(x+1)(x+2)} > 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Sign\n\nNow, notice that \\(x^2 + 4x + 6 = (x+2)^2 + 2\\), and it's always positive. Therefore, the inequality simplifies to:\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{x-1}{x(x+1)(x+2)} > 0.\n\\]\n\nLet's make a sign table and explore each interval:\n\n- **Critical Points**: \\(x = -2, -1, 0, 1\\).\n- Check the sign changes of \\(f(x)\\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc|c}\n& x & x-1 & x+1 & x+2 & f(x) \\\\\n\\hline\nx < -2 & - & - & - & - & + \\\\\n-2 < x < -1 & - & - & - & + & - \\\\\n-1 < x < 0 & - & - & + & + & + \\\\\n0 < x < 1 & + & - & + & + & - \\\\\nx > 1 & + & + & + & + & + \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAssembling the intervals where \\(f(x) > 0\\), we conclude:\n\\[\nx \\in (-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-1, 0) \\cup (1, \\infty).\n\\]\n\nReflecting on this revised solution, it aligns with logical expectations, showing intervals where the inequality holds. Thank you for bearing with me as we dissected this carefully step by step!",
