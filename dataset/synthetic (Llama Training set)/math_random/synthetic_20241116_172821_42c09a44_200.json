    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n- This problem looks like it involves a type of functional equation. I remember similar problems where substitutions could help simplify or reveal properties of the function. I need to explore substitutions carefully.\n- The condition \\( f(x+y) = 3^y f(x) + 2^x f(y) \\) suggests some balance between exponential growth and initial value. I should consider if this has a common form, like exponential functions.\n\n---\n\nStep 1: Consider an easy substitution to simplify the problem.\n\n- Let's first try \\( y = 0 \\):\n  - The equation becomes: \\( f(x + 0) = 3^0 f(x) + 2^x f(0) \\).\n  - Simplifying, we get \\( f(x) = f(x) + 2^x f(0) \\).\n  - This implies \\( 2^x f(0) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), which means \\( f(0) = 0 \\).\n  - This doesn\u2019t tell me everything yet, but it's a small step.\n\nStep 2: Use the given \\( f(1) = 1 \\).\n\n- Set \\( x = 1 \\), and explore with different \\( y \\).\n- Trying \\( y = 1 \\) could be insightful:\n  - Plug into the equation: \\( f(1 + 1) = 3^1 f(1) + 2^1 f(1) \\).\n  - Simplifies to: \\( f(2) = 3 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 1 = 5 \\).\n\n- Next, check \\( y = 2 \\):\n  - Using \\( x = 1 \\), \\( y = 2 \\): \\( f(1 + 2) = 3^2 f(1) + 2^1 f(2) \\).\n  - Simplifies to: \\( f(3) = 9 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 5 = 19 \\).\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Develop a hypothesis about the form of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n- From the above steps, observed values are \\( f(1) = 1 \\), \\( f(2) = 5 \\), \\( f(3) = 19 \\).\n- Guess: Possibly \\( f(x) = a \\cdot 3^x + b \\cdot 2^x \\) matches this pattern.\n- But to check a pattern, assume \\( f(x) = a \\cdot 3^x + b \\cdot 2^x \\).\n\nSubstitutions to verify hypothesis:\n- Trying \\( f(x) = 3^x - 2^x \\) seems promising.\n- Check \\( f(1) = 3^1 - 2^1 = 3 - 2 = 1 \\), which is correct.\n\nLet's run this hypothesis through the main equation:\n- Assume \\( f(x) = 3^x - 2^x \\).\n- For \\( x + y \\): \\( f(x+y) = 3^{x+y} - 2^{x+y} \\).\n- Check RHS with assumed function:\n  \\[ 3^y f(x) + 2^x f(y) = 3^y (3^x - 2^x) + 2^x (3^y - 2^y) \\]\n  \\[ = 3^{x+y} - 3^y \\cdot 2^x + 3^y \\cdot 2^x - 2^{x+y} \\]\n  \\[ = 3^{x+y} - 2^{x+y} \\]\n  \nThis matches with the LHS: \\( f(x+y) = 3^{x+y} - 2^{x+y} \\).\n\nFinal Reflection:\n- The function that satisfies all conditions and checks is \\( f(x) = 3^x - 2^x \\).\n- All substitutions and initial conditions justify this hypothesis as correct. It solves the equation perfectly.\n\nConclusion:\n- The function is \\( f(x) = 3^x - 2^x \\).\n- The process was consistent with each step proving the validity of the hypothesis.",
