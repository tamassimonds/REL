    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\nI'm given that two rectangles have perimeters of 144 cm each. I need to find the greatest possible difference between their areas. First thoughts: Perimeter is related to the sum of the side lengths, and area is related to their product. I've solved problems with perimeters and areas before, but making the areas as different as possible is new. I suspect that this might involve making one rectangle long and thin and the other more balanced.\n\n**Understanding the Perimeter and Area:**\n- The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is \\( 2 \\times ( \\text{length} + \\text{width} ) = 144 \\).\n- Therefore, \\( \\text{length} + \\text{width} = 72 \\).\n\nFor each rectangle, given this equation:\n- I can express one dimension as \\( \\text{width} = 72 - \\text{length} \\).\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of the rectangle is \\( \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = \\text{length} \\times (72 - \\text{length}) \\).\n\n**Goal: Maximize and minimize areas using integer dimensions:**\nLet's explore different combinations of length and width within our constraint to create the maximum and minimum areas.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. Find two configurations:\n   - One that maximizes the area.\n   - One that minimizes the area.\n2. The difference between these two areas will be our answer.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n1. **Balanced Rectangle (for Maximum Area):**\n   - The area will be maximized when \\( \\text{length} = \\text{width} \\), or as close as possible with integers. Since \\( \\text{length} + \\text{width} = 72 \\), the closest integers are \\( 36 \\) and \\( 36 \\).\n   - Maximum area = \\( 36 \\times 36 = 1296 \\).\n\n2. **Extremes for Minimum Area:**\n   - To minimize the area, we want one dimension to be much larger than the other. Let's set \\( \\text{length} = 71 \\) (almost the entire perimeter's half), then \\( \\text{width} = 72 - 71 = 1 \\).\n   - Minimum area = \\( 71 \\times 1 = 71 \\).\n\n**Difference Calculation:**\n- Difference in areas = Maximum area - Minimum area = \\( 1296 - 71 = 1225 \\).\n\n**Checking the Approach:**\n- Quick check: My approach seems sound. The configuration for maximizing the area uses dimensions close to a square, and for minimizing the area, creates a very elongated rectangle.\n- Quick calculation of areas confirms high and low boundaries with significant difference.\n- Reflecting on potential pitfalls: Since both maximum and minimum configurations are indeed achievable under perimeter constraints, and calculations are correct, this seems like a reasonable approach.\n- All integer conditions have been respected, and no other lengths will give larger difference based on visual or trial methods.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe greatest possible difference between the areas of two rectangles with perimeters 144 cm each is \\( \\boxed{1225} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let the dimensions of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$.  We are given $2l+2w=144$, which implies $l+w=72$.  Solving for $w$, we have $w=72-l$.  The area of the rectangle is $lw=l(72-l)$.  As a function of $l$, this expression is a parabola whose zeros are at $l=0$ and $l=72$ (see graph).  The $y$-coordinate of a point on the parabola is maximized when the $x$-coordinate is chosen as close to the $x$-coordinate of the vertex as possible.  The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the zeros at $x=(0+72)/2=36$, so the maximum area is $(36)(36)=1296$ square units.  Similarly, to minimize the area we choose the length to be as far from $36$ as possible.  The resulting dimensions are $1$ unit and $71$ units, so the minimum area is 71 square units.  The difference between 1296 square units and 71 square units is $\\boxed{1225}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nsize(150,IgnoreAspect);\nreal f(real x)\n{\n\nreturn x*(15-x);\n}\nxaxis(Arrows(4));\nyaxis(ymax=f(7.5),Arrows(4));\ndraw(graph(f,-3,18),Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"Area\",(0,f(7.5)),N);\nlabel(\"$l$\",(18,0),S);[/asy]"
