    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- This problem involves similar triangles and proportional relationships, which is interesting because I remember using scale factors in problems like this. The key is to relate the side lengths of the two triangles.\n- Essentially, we need to use the properties of similar triangles, where corresponding side lengths are in proportion.\n- Knowing that similar triangles have the same shape but different sizes should help in setting up our approach here.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the given information.\n- We have a triangle with sides 6 cm, 7 cm, and 9 cm.\n- There's a similar triangle with a perimeter of 110 cm.\n- Our task is to find the length of the longest side of this new triangle.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the perimeter of the original triangle.\n- Sum of the sides: 6 cm + 7 cm + 9 cm = 22 cm.\n- This is good information. With a perimeter of 22 cm for the original triangle, we can find the scale factor.\n\nStep 3: Determine the scale factor from the perimeter.\n- Scale factor = Perimeter of larger triangle / Perimeter of original triangle = 110 cm / 22 cm.\n- Wait, that scale factor looks off. Let's compute it: 110 / 22 = 5.\n- Oh, yeah. Division sometimes trips me up. 5 is correct. \n\nStep 4: Calculate the side lengths in the new triangle using the scale factor.\n- Multiply each side of the original triangle by the scale factor to find corresponding sides in the similar triangle.\n- Longest side in original triangle = 9 cm.\n- Length of longest side in similar triangle = 9 cm \u00d7 5 = 45 cm.\n\nStep 5: Perform a quick check and reflection.\n- Quick checks are essential here. Let's make sure everything is logical.\n- Original perimeter was 22 cm, scaled perimeter is calculated appropriately.\n- Scale factor was used consistently across each side.\n- Longest original side was correctly scaled to find the longest side of the new triangle.\n\nConclusion:\n- The length of the longest side in the similar triangle is 45 cm.\n- This makes sense considering the calculations align with the properties of similar triangles: consistent proportions and scale factor application. \n\nOverall, careful breakdown and verification at each step ensured the solution's accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the ratio of side lengths between the similar triangle and the given triangle be $x$, so the lengths of the similar triangle are $6x$, $7x$, and $9x$.  We are given that $6x+7x+9x=110$; solving yields $x=\\frac{110}{(6+7+9)} = \\frac{110}{22}=5$.  The length of the longest side is thus $9x = 9 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{45}$."
