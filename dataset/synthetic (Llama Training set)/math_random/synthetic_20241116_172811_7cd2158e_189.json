    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nOkay, we're given a recursively defined sequence with the first term \\( u_1 = a \\) and the recursive formula \\( u_{n+1} = -\\frac{1}{u_n + 1} \\). My goal is to find a general form or pattern that can help me express \\( u_{16} \\) in terms of \\( a \\). This problem seems like it could involve finding a repeating pattern or cycle. \n\nI notice that the sequence involves recursion with a non-linear transformation, which makes it difficult to directly express \\( u_{16} \\) without finding a pattern. It reminds me a bit of sequences that toggle between a limited number of states.\n\nInitial Plan:\n\n1. Compute a few terms to see if I can detect a cycle or pattern.\n2. Look for any symmetries or repeating sequences.\n3. Consider the possibility that the sequence might loop back to the original term or exhibit a repeating behavior due to the nature of the recursive formula.\n4. Confirm any found pattern through calculations.\n5. Use mathematical induction if necessary to prove a pattern.\n\nStep 1: Compute Initial Terms\n\n1. \\( u_1 = a \\)\n\n   I start by observing \\( u_1 = a \\). This is simple enough and already given.\n\n2. Compute \\( u_2 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   u_2 = -\\frac{1}{u_1 + 1} = -\\frac{1}{a + 1}\n   \\]\n\n3. Compute \\( u_3 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   u_3 = -\\frac{1}{u_2 + 1} = -\\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{a+1} + 1} = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{a}{a+1}} = -\\frac{a+1}{a}\n   \\]\n\n4. Compute \\( u_4 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   u_4 = -\\frac{1}{u_3 + 1} = -\\frac{1}{-\\frac{a+1}{a} + 1} = -\\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{a}} = a\n   \\]\n\nOh! I see, \\( u_4 = a \\), which is the same as \\( u_1 \\). This suggests a possible pattern or cycle every three steps. Let\u2019s explore further to ensure it's not a fluke.\n\nStep 2: Confirming the Pattern\n\n5. Compute \\( u_5 \\):\n\n   Since \\( u_4 = u_1 = a \\), by similar calculation as above:\n   \\[\n   u_5 = -\\frac{1}{u_4 + 1} = -\\frac{1}{a + 1} = u_2\n   \\]\n\n6. Compute \\( u_6 \\):\n\n   Again, since \\( u_5 = u_2 = -\\frac{1}{a+1} \\), by similar calculation:\n   \\[\n   u_6 = -\\frac{1}{u_5 + 1} = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{a}{a+1}} = -\\frac{a+1}{a} = u_3\n   \\]\n\n7. Compute \\( u_7 \\):\n\n   As \\( u_6 = u_3 = -\\frac{a+1}{a} \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   u_7 = -\\frac{1}{u_6 + 1} = -\\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{a}} = a = u_1\n   \\]\n\nFrom this computation, it appears that the sequence is cyclic, repeating every three terms.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\n\n8. Given that sequence repeats every three terms, I can express \\( u_{n} \\) such that:\n   - When \\( n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\), \\( u_n = a \\)\n   - When \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), \\( u_n = -\\frac{1}{a+1} \\)\n   - When \\( n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\), \\( u_n = -\\frac{a+1}{a} \\)\n\n9. Since \\( 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\), we conclude:\n\n   \\[\n   u_{16} = a\n   \\]\n\nValidation:\n\nThis makes sense as all my earlier steps confirm that the sequence cycles every three terms. The recursive definition, upon plugging back multiple terms, consistently aligns across calculated repeated cycles.\n\nOverall, problem-solving here involved hypothesis of a cycle, due reiterative independence of recursive step, along eventual confirmation by validating against multiple terms, leading consistently to desired result.",
