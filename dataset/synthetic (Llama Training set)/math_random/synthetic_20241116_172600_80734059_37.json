    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this one step by step. \n\n### First Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see this problem, it reminds me of finding remainders and using modular arithmetic. We're trying to find a multiple of 3 that is close to 412. So, I'm thinking about how 412 relates to 3, specifically the remainder when dividing by 3.\n\n### Analyzing the Problem\n\nThe question asks for the least positive integer that, when added to 412, results in a multiple of 3. This makes me think about how numbers behave when divided by 3. \n\n#### Possible Strategy:\n\n1. **Divide 412 by 3 and find the remainder**: This is usually a good start for problems involving multiples of 3 because if I know the remainder, I can determine how much more I need to add to reach the next multiple.\n\n2. **Adjust based on the remainder**: Depending on the remainder, I'll know how many more I need to add to reach a number divisible by 3.\n\nAlright, let's jump in!\n\n### Step 1: Division to Find the Remainder\n\nI'll divide 412 by 3 and see what remainder I get.\n\n- **Calculation**: 412 \u00f7 3  \n  I go through the division in my mind:\n  - 3 goes into 4 one time (that covers 3), leaving 1.\n  - Bring down the 1 to make 11. 3 goes into 11 three times (that covers 9), leaving 2.\n  - Finally, bring down the 2 to make 22. 3 goes into 22 seven times (that covers 21), leaving 1.\n\n- **Outcome**: The remainder is 1.\n\nSo, 412 is 3 times 137 plus 1 (412 = 3 * 137 + 1).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Adjustment Needed\n\nSince the remainder is 1, I need to find how much to add to 412 to eliminate this remainder and make it a multiple of 3.\n\n- **Logic**: To get to the next multiple of 3, I need to add the amount that will make the final remainder 0. Here, it's clear we need to add 2 (since 3 - 1 = 2).\n\n### Step 3: Verification\n\nIt's always good to check if this makes sense:\n\n- **New Number**: If I add 2 to 412, I get 414.\n- **Check Multiplicity**: Let's check if 414 is divisible by 3:\n\n   - **Calculation**: 414 \u00f7 3\n     - 3 goes into 4 one time, leaving 1.\n     - Bring down the 1 to make 11. 3 goes into 11 three times, leaving 2.\n     - Bring down the 4 to make 24. 3 goes into 24 eight times, no remainder.\n\n- **Verification Outcome**: 414 is indeed divisible by 3. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo, the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to make it a multiple of 3 is **2**. \n\nThis feels right. The calculations check out, and all the logic was consistent throughout. Solved the problem step by step, and I feel confident in the solution.",
