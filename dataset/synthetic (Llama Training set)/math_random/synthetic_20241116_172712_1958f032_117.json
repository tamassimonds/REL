    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see which of these functions have inverses. Initially, I know that a function can have an inverse if it is one-to-one (bijective). A good way to check if a function is one-to-one is to use the Horizontal Line Test for its graph, or check if it's strictly increasing or decreasing in its given domain. \n\n### Let's start with the brainstorming:\n\n1. **Function A: \\( a(x) = \\sqrt{2 - x}, \\, x \\in (-\\infty, 2] \\).**\n\n   - **First thought**: This function is a square-root function, and square roots typically imply a restriction to non-negative values.\n   - **Reflection**: For a square root function to have an inverse, it needs to be defined precisely over an interval such that no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once.\n   - **Approach**: Check if the expression under the square root is decreasing. \\( \\sqrt{2-x} \\) decreases as \\( x \\) increases. So within the domain \\( (-\\infty, 2] \\), it's one-to-one.\n\n2. **Function B: \\( b(x) = x^3 - x, \\, x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\).**\n\n   - **First thought**: Since \\( b(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, its behavior could be complex.\n   - **Reflection**: Cusps or bends in a graph can mean that a function is not one-to-one.\n   - **Approach**: Check its derivative \\( b'(x) = 3x^2 - 1 \\) to determine where it's increasing or decreasing. If there's any interval over which it both increases and decreases, it's not one-to-one.\n   - **Check**: Has critical points where \\( 3x^2 - 1 = 0 \\) or \\( x = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\). This means there's both increasing and decreasing behavior, failing the Horizontal Line Test.\n\n3. **Function C: \\( c(x) = x + \\frac{1}{x}, \\, x \\in (0, \\infty) \\).**\n\n   - **First thought**: The addition of \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) introduces a reciprocal element.\n   - **Approach**: Analyze monotonicity by checking the derivative.\n   - **Derivative check**: Compute \\( c'(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x^2} \\). It is zero when \\( x = \\pm 1 \\), meaning it does not have consistent increasing or decreasing behavior. So it's not one-to-one over its domain.\n\n4. **Function D: \\( d(x) = 2x^2 + 4x + 7, \\, x \\in [0, \\infty) \\).**\n\n   - **First thought**: Quadratic functions are generally not one-to-one unless restricted to a domain where they are strictly monotonic.\n   - **Approach**: Check if the quadratic can be reduced to a monotonic function. The vertex is a good point of analysis.\n   - **Check**: The vertex is at \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -1 \\), which is outside the given domain. Thus, in \\([0, \\infty)\\), it's strictly increasing, so it's one-to-one.\n\n5. **Function E: \\( e(x) = |x - 2| + |x + 3|, \\, x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\).**\n\n   - **First thought**: Absolute functions can have multiple linear segments.\n   - **Approach**: Check how \\( e(x) \\) changes across breakpoints, typically \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\).\n   - **Check**: For \\( x < -3 \\), \\(-x-5\\), for \\(-3 \\leq x < 2\\), it is \\(5\\), for \\(x \\geq 2\\), \\(x+1\\). Not one-to-one across the real numbers.\n\n6. **Function F: \\( f(x) = 3^x + 7^x, \\, x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\).**\n\n   - **First thought**: Sum of exponential functions generally leads to an increasing function.\n   - **Approach**: Analyze the behavior - each individual term \\( 3^x \\) and \\( 7^x \\) is increasing.\n   - **Check**: Both \\( f(x) \\)'s components are strictly increasing functions, hence their sum is strictly increasing, implying one-to-one behavior.\n\n7. **Function G: \\( g(x) = x - \\frac{1}{x}, \\, x \\in (0, \\infty) \\).**\n\n   - **First thought**: The subtraction of the reciprocal might make it tricky.\n   - **Approach**: Again, use derivatives to check monotonicity.\n   - **Check**: \\( g'(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x^2} \\), always positive, hence \\( g(x) \\) is strictly increasing, implying one-to-one.\n\n8. **Function H: \\( h(x) = \\frac{x}{2}, \\, x \\in [-2, 7) \\).**\n\n   - **First thought**: This is a linear function.\n   - **Approach**: Linear functions of the form \\( ax + b \\) are always one-to-one if \\( a \\neq 0 \\).\n   - **Check**: Slope \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) is non-zero, making it one-to-one.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter working through each function, we can conclude which are one-to-one and so have inverses:\n\n- **A** is one-to-one.\n- **D** is one-to-one.\n- **F** is one-to-one.\n- **G** is one-to-one.\n- **H** is one-to-one.\n\nThe functions that meet the criteria and thus have inverses are: **A, D, F, G, H**.\n\nFinal answer: **A, D, F, G, H**.",

  "ground_truth": "A. The function $a(x) = \\sqrt{2 - x}$ is decreasing, so it has an inverse.\n\nB. Note that $b(0) = b(1) = 0,$ so the function $b(x)$ does not have an inverse.\n\nC. Note that $c \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = c(2) = \\frac{5}{2},$ so the function $c(x)$ does not have an inverse.\n\nD. The function $d(x) = 2x^2 + 4x + 7 = 2(x + 1)^2 + 5$ is increasing on $[0,\\infty),$ so it has an inverse.\n\nE. Note that $e(2) = e(-3) = 5,$ so the function $e(x)$ does not have an inverse.\n\nF. Both $3^x$ and $7^x$ are increasing, so $f(x) = 3^x + 7^x$ is also increasing.  Hence, it has an inverse.\n\nG. Suppose $g(a) = g(b)$ for some $a,$ $b > 0.$  Then\n\\[a - \\frac{1}{a} = b - \\frac{1}{b}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $ab,$ we get\n\\[a^2 b - b = ab^2 - a.\\]Then $a^2 b - ab^2 + a - b = 0,$ which factors as $(a - b)(ab + 1) = 0.$  Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $ab + 1$ cannot be 0, so $a = b.$\n\nWe have shown that $g(a) = g(b)$ forces $a = b,$ so the function $g(x)$ has an inverse.\n\nH. The function $h(x) = \\frac{x}{2}$ has an inverse, namely $h^{-1}(x) = 2x.$\n\nThus, the letters of the functions that have inverses are $\\boxed{\\text{A, D, F, G, H}}.$"
