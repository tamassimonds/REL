    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this and break it down step by step. \n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nFirst, let's really get what the problem is asking. We're looking at a circle with 10 distinct points on it. We need to find out how many different convex polygons with three or more sides we can make using these points as corners. \n\nConvex polygons are those where all internal angles are less than 180 degrees, so they won\u2019t \u201ccave in\u201d or have a point sticking out in the middle. I'm imagining this is like trying to connect dots on a circle with straight lines, where the lines don\u2019t cross back into the circle.\n\n### Step 2: Connecting the Dots\nInitially, I'm thinking about how I could make triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, and so on, using these points. \n\n- **Triangles:** We can choose any three points. \n- **Quadrilaterals:** We choose four points.\n- **Pentagons:** Choose five points, and so on...\n\nSince the points are on a circle, any set of chosen points will naturally form a convex polygon, as long as you have three or more points.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Combinations\nThis problem seems like it could be solved by the combination formula, which allows us to choose a certain number of items from a larger set without regard to the order of selection. This would be \"n choose k\", denoted as \\( C(n, k) \\), which is given by:\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\nWhere \\( n \\) is the total number of points, and \\( k \\) is the number of points we choose to form a polygon.\n\n### Step 4: Applying Combinations to the Problem\nThe question wants the sum of polygons from 3 sides up to 10 sides. So, we calculate:\n\n- For triangles (\\(k=3\\)): \n  \\[ C(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3! \\cdot 7!} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 120 \\]\n\n- For quadrilaterals (\\(k=4\\)): \n  \\[ C(10, 4) = \\frac{10!}{4! \\cdot 6!} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 210 \\]\n\n- For pentagons (\\(k=5\\)): \n  \\[ C(10, 5) = \\frac{10!}{5! \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 252 \\]\n\n- For hexagons (\\(k=6\\)): \n  \\[ C(10, 6) = \\frac{10!}{6! \\cdot 4!} = 210 \\]\n\n- For heptagons (\\(k=7\\)): \n  \\[ C(10, 7) = \\frac{10!}{7! \\cdot 3!} = 120 \\]\n\n- For octagons (\\(k=8\\)): \n  \\[ C(10, 8) = \\frac{10!}{8! \\cdot 2!} = 45 \\]\n\n- For nonagons (\\(k=9\\)): \n  \\[ C(10, 9) = \\frac{10!}{9! \\cdot 1!} = 10 \\]\n\n- For decagons (\\(k=10\\)): \n  \\[ C(10, 10) = \\frac{10!}{10! \\cdot 0!} = 1 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Summing the Results\nSumming these up gives us the total number of polygons possible:\n\\[ 120 + 210 + 252 + 210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 = 968 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Verify the Reasoning\nReflecting back on this, since each selection of points around the circle will inherently form a convex polygon (as there\u2019s no chance to form a concave one on a circle without having interior angles >180 degrees), the combinations should accurately reflect all the valid polygons.\n\nThus, the final answer is **968 distinct convex polygons** can be formed using 10 points on a circle. \n\nI feel confident in this approach because it relies directly on fundamental combinatorial principles and does not overlook obvious cases or constraints due to the nature of circles and convexity.",

  "ground_truth": "Any subset of the ten points with three or more members can be made into exactly one such polygon. Thus, we need to count the number of such subsets. There are $2^{10} = 1024$ total subsets of a ten-member set, but of these ${10 \\choose 0} = 1$ have 0 members, ${10 \\choose 1} = 10$ have 1 member and ${10 \\choose 2} = 45$ have 2 members. Thus the answer is $1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 = \\boxed{968}$."
