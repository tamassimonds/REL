    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. The problem is asking us to find the equation of a plane given that the foot of the perpendicular from the origin to the plane is at the point \\((12, -4, 3)\\).\n\n### First Impressions:\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** The fact that a perpendicular from the origin lands on the plane at \\((12, -4, 3)\\) suggests that this point is significant in terms of understanding the relationship between the plane and the origin. This point likely lies directly along the normal vector of the plane.\n  \n- **Equation Recall:** The standard equation of a plane in 3D space is \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\). The coefficients \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) form the normal vector to the plane.\n\n### Brainstorming How to Proceed:\n\n1. **Use the Foot of the Perpendicular:** If \\((12, -4, 3)\\) is the foot of the perpendicular, it could mean that \\((A, B, C)\\) is proportional to \\((12, -4, 3)\\) since the normal to the plane from the origin to the point should ideally align or be parallel.\n   \n2. **Consider the Directionality:** The normal vector being \\((12, -4, 3)\\) naturally aligns with the direction from the origin to the point. This likely implies that an equation of the plane can directly use these as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\): i.e., \\(12x - 4y + 3z + D = 0\\).\n\n### Analysing the Plane Equation:\n\n- **Substituting the Point:** Since \\((12, -4, 3)\\) is on the plane, substitute into the equation to identify \\(D\\):\n  \n  \\[\n  12(12) - 4(-4) + 3(3) + D = 0\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  144 + 16 + 9 + D = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 169 + D = 0\n  \\]\n\n  Solving for \\(D\\), we find:\n\n  \\[\n  D = -169\n  \\]\n\n**Tentative Plane Equation:** At this point, the plane equation looks like:\n\n\\[12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0\\]\n\n### Final Adjustments and Checks:\n\n- **Optimize Equation:** The current coefficients \\(12\\), \\(-4\\), and \\(3\\) are already relatively prime among themselves and with \\(-169\\).\n\n- **Verify Normalization Requirement:** Given \\(A > 0\\) and GCD of absolute values set to 1, \\( \\gcd(12, 4, 3, 169) = 1\\) and \\(A = 12\\) is positive, so no further adjustment is needed.\n\n### Solution Reflection:\n\n- **Intuition Check:** The method matches logical reasoning using vector norms, and the computational substitution confirms correctness.\n- **Verification:** A quick reassessment shows that each step\u2014aligning the normal, point-check substitution, and coefficient optimization\u2014all logically check out under the problem constraints.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe correctly formulated equation of the plane is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0} \\]\n\nThis formulation considers the directionality of the normal, practical adjustments for integer alignment, and cross-verification of point satisfaction.",

  "ground_truth": "We can take $\\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector of the plane.
