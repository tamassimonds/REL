    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into solving the problem: \n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what we're asked to find. The function given is \\( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \\). We're tasked with finding \\( f(f(1)) \\). This means we first need to evaluate \\( f(1) \\), and then use that result as the input for the function again. In other words, we're evaluating the function twice. \n\n**Step 2: Evaluate \\( f(1) \\)**\n\nTo calculate \\( f(1) \\), substitute \\( x = 1 \\) into the function:\n\\[ f(1) = 3(1)^2 - 5 \\]\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\\[ 3(1)^2 \\] is just 3, so we have:\n\\[ 3 - 5 \\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\\[ f(1) = -2 \\]\n\n**Reflection**: This seems reasonable. I double-checked the math here and substituting and simplifying correctly leads to \\( -2 \\). Let's move on to the next step with this value.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate \\( f(f(1)) \\), which is \\( f(-2) \\)**\n\nNow that we have \\( f(1) = -2 \\), the problem reduces to finding \\( f(-2) \\). Substitute \\( x = -2 \\) into the function:\n\\[ f(-2) = 3(-2)^2 - 5 \\]\n\nLet's work through this step-by-step:\n1. Calculate \\( (-2)^2 \\), which is 4.\n2. Multiply by 3: \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\).\n3. Subtract 5 to get: \\( 12 - 5 \\).\n\nThis results in:\n\\[ f(-2) = 7 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe value of \\( f(f(1)) = f(-2) = 7 \\).\n\n**Final Reflection**: Everything checks out; the calculations are straightforward. Looking back, the steps flowed logically from understanding the problem to substituting the values and performing arithmetic. I\u2019ve double-checked each substitution step and recalculated them separately to confirm they're correct. It feels good knowing the approach was validated at each stage.",
