    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem: we need to solve the equation \\( |y-6| + 2y = 9 \\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- Hmm, this looks like an absolute value equation. I know that absolute value equations often involve considering separate cases based on the expression inside the absolute value.\n- The expression inside the absolute value is \\( y - 6 \\). The transition point, where the expression switches its sign, is at \\( y = 6 \\).\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Let's consider two cases:\n  1. \\( y - 6 \\geq 0 \\) which implies \\( y \\geq 6 \\).\n  2. \\( y - 6 < 0 \\) which implies \\( y < 6 \\).\n\nFirst, I'll solve for each case separately.\n\n**Case 1: \\( y \\geq 6 \\)**\n\n- Here, \\( |y - 6| = y - 6 \\). So the equation becomes:\n  \\[\n  y - 6 + 2y = 9\n  \\]\n\n- Let's simplify this equation:\n  \\[\n  3y - 6 = 9\n  \\]\n\n- Add 6 to both sides:\n  \\[\n  3y = 15\n  \\]\n\n- Divide by 3:\n  \\[\n  y = 5\n  \\]\n\n- Now, let's check: is \\( y = 5 \\) valid in this case? For \\( y \\geq 6 \\), \\( y = 5 \\) does not satisfy \\( y \\geq 6 \\). This means \\( y = 5 \\) is not a valid solution for this case. No solutions here.\n\n**Case 2: \\( y < 6 \\)**\n\n- Here, \\( |y - 6| = -(y - 6) = 6 - y \\). So the equation becomes:\n  \\[\n  6 - y + 2y = 9\n  \\]\n\n- Simplify the equation:\n  \\[\n  6 + y = 9\n  \\]\n\n- Subtract 6 from both sides:\n  \\[\n  y = 3\n  \\]\n\n- Let's check: is \\( y = 3 \\) valid in this case? For \\( y < 6 \\), \\( y = 3 \\) satisfies \\( y < 6 \\). So \\( y = 3 \\) is a valid solution.\n\n**Solution Check:**\n\n- If \\( y = 3 \\), substitute back into the original equation to verify:\n\n  - Compute \\( |y-6| = |3-6| = 3 \\).\n  - Substitute into the equation: \\( 3 + 2(3) = 3 + 6 = 9 \\).\n  - This matches the right side of the equation, confirming \\( y = 3 \\) is indeed correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The only solution is \\( y = 3 \\).\n- This approach matches the solution check, and since no solutions arise from the \\( y \\geq 6 \\) scenario, \\( y = 3 \\) stands as the correct and only answer. \n\nThe key process here involved properly considering the absolute value scenarios and then carefully checking any obtained solutions against the constraints of the original conditions.",

  "ground_truth": "We consider two cases, $y\\ge 6$ and $y < 6$.\n\nCase 1: $y \\ge 6:$  If $y \\ge 6$, then $|y-6| = y-6$ and our equation is $y-6+2y=9$.  So, we have $3y = 15$, or $y=5$. However, $y=5$ does not satisfy $y\\ge 6$.  Testing $y=5$, we have $|5-6| + 2\\cdot 5 =11$, not 9, and we see that $y=5$ is not a solution.\n\nCase 2: $y < 6:$   If $y<6$, then $|y-6| = -(y-6) = -y+6$, so our equation is $-y+6+2y = 9$, from which we have $y=\\boxed{3}$. This is a valid solution, since $y=3$ satisfies the restriction $y<6$."
