    "working_out": "Sure, let's work through this problem together, step by step.\n\n**First Impressions and Brainstorming:**\n- Looking at the equation \\(\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + \\sqrt{x - 1} = 1\\), I notice that we're dealing with both a cube root and a square root. This immediately suggests that we'll need to be cautious of domain issues, because roots generally have conditions on the inputs to return real numbers.\n- My first thought is that both expressions under the roots must return results that will sum up to 1. Also, these expressions must be defined for the range of \\(x\\).\n- My mind jumps to solving equations with nested roots from previous work where isolating one of the roots and squaring or cubing both sides helps. But before that, let\u2019s consider the restrictions both rooted expressions impose.\n\n**Exploring Domain:**\n- \\(\\sqrt[3]{2-x}\\) is defined for all real \\(x\\), since cube roots are defined for negative values as well.\n- \\(\\sqrt{x - 1}\\) is only defined for \\(x \\geq 1\\).\n- Combining these observations: \\(x\\) must be at least 1 for the entire equation to be valid.\n\n**Trying a Strategy:**\n- Start by thinking: Can we isolate a term? A simple transformation might be useful:\n  \n \\[\n \\sqrt[3]{2-x} = 1 - \\sqrt{x-1}\n \\]\n\n- For \\(\\sqrt[3]{2-x}\\) to equal \\(1 - \\sqrt{x-1}\\), each term must result in a real number.\n- Cube both sides to eliminate the cube root:\n\n \\[\n 2-x = (1 - \\sqrt{x-1})^3\n \\]\n\n**Cube Expansion:**\n- Expanding \\((1 - \\sqrt{x-1})^3\\): \n\n \\[\n (1 - \\sqrt{x-1})^3 = 1 - 3\\sqrt{x-1} + 3(x-1) - (x-1)^{3/2}\n \\]\n\n- This seems a bit complex. Let me redo it to avoid mistakes:\n  - First, \\( (a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3 \\).\n  - Here, \\(a = 1 \\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{x-1}\\).\n  - Result: \\((1 - \\sqrt{x-1})^3 = 1 - 3\\sqrt{x-1} + 3(x-1) - (x-1)^{3/2}\\).\n\n**Try a Specific Value:**\n- Sometimes trying specific values within the identified domain might quickly solve the problem:\n- Start with \\(x = 1\\):\n\n \\[\n \\sqrt[3]{2-1} + \\sqrt{1-1} = 1 + 0 = 1\n \\]\n\n- This satisfies the equation. Good \u2013 x = 1 is one solution.\n\n**Reflect and Re-evaluate:**\n- Does anything else fit? Focus on simplicity and changes.\n- Trying further numbers might work, but inspection suggests continuing algebra could unravel more.\n\n**Trying General Algebra Approach (Revisit):**\n- Let\u2019s simplify different values besides the current working solution, providing rational aesthetics to solutions and logic proof.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x-1} = 0 \\implies x = 1\n\\]\n\n- Ensures equivalence when plugged back into the original, reinforcing restriction checks that highlight viability over derived non-contradictions.\n  \n**Conclusion:**\n- Given we've verified logically and computed checks for viable domain values, recurring non-contradictory outcomes validate the approach.\n- \\( \\boxed{1} \\) is thus our single verified solution encapsulated within naturally possible real numbers.\n\nFinally, conclude that checking either through algebra or direct substitution confirms \\(x = 1\\) as repeating validly. Writing it out like this allows visibility over all steps and possible oversight earlier.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous approach. Let's correct it by re-evaluating the problem and systematically working through it again to find all possible solutions.\n\n**Re-evaluation Strategy:**\n\n1. **Revisit the Original Problem:**\n   - We have \\(\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + \\sqrt{x - 1} = 1\\).\n   - Previously, I found that \\(x = 1\\) satisfied the equation, but I missed considering the other possibilities. Let's ensure we explore all cases.\n\n2. **Substitution Technique:**\n   - Let's try introducing a substitution to simplify the problem. Let \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{2-x}\\).\n   - This gives us \\(y^3 = 2 - x\\), which means \\(x = 2 - y^3\\).\n   - The equation then becomes \\(y + \\sqrt{1-y^3} = 1\\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\(y\\):**\n   - Rearrange to \\(\\sqrt{1-y^3} = 1 - y\\).\n   - Square both sides: \\(1 - y^3 = (1 - y)^2\\).\n   - Expand the squared term: \\((1 - y)^2 = 1 - 2y + y^2\\).\n\n4. **Get a Single Polynomial:**\n   - Now equate the expressions: \\(1 - y^3 = 1 - 2y + y^2\\).\n   - Rearrange terms to give: \\(y^3 + y^2 - 2y = 0\\).\n\n5. **Factor the Polynomial:**\n   - Factor out \\(y\\): \\(y(y - 1)(y + 2) = 0\\).\n\n6. **Solutions for \\(y\\):**\n   - This gives us \\(y = 0\\), \\(y = 1\\), or \\(y = -2\\).\n\n7. **Convert \\(y\\) back to \\(x\\):**\n   - For \\(y = 0\\), \\(x = 2 - 0^3 = 2\\).\n   - For \\(y = 1\\), \\(x = 2 - 1^3 = 1\\) (already verified).\n   - For \\(y = -2\\), \\(x = 2 - (-2)^3 = 2 + 8 = 10\\).\n\n8. **Verification:**\n   - **For \\(x = 2\\):**\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt[3]{2-2} + \\sqrt{2-1} = 0 + 1 = 1\n     \\]\n     - This checks out.\n   - **For \\(x = 10\\):**\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt[3]{2-10} + \\sqrt{10-1} = \\sqrt[3]{-8} + \\sqrt{9} = -2 + 3 = 1\n     \\]\n     - This also checks out.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n- After thoroughly re-evaluating the problem and considering the correct substitutions, the complete set of solutions is:\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{1, 2, 10}\n  \\]\nI've verified each potential solution to ensure they satisfy the original equation. Reflecting on different strategies and factoring the cubic expression correctly led to uncovering all possibilities.",
