    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\nOkay, let's break down this question systematically. We need to find triangles with integer side lengths that have a perimeter of 7. Instinctively, I know I should use both the conditions of the triangle inequality theorem and the integer nature of side lengths to limit possible side combinations. \n\nBrainstorming:\n\n1. I'll need to revisit the triangle inequality theorem: For any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\n2. The sides are integers, and their sum is 7. So, if \\( a, b, c \\) are the sides and \\( a \\leq b \\leq c \\), then \\( a + b + c = 7\\).\n\n3. Let's simplify the possible options by considering small integer values first for side \\( a \\), and then work up gradually ensuring I check each case against the triangle inequality rule.\n\nWorking Through:\n\n1. Let's start by assuming \\( a = 1 \\).\n\n    - Then \\( b + c = 6 \\).\n    - By the triangle inequality: \n      - \\( 1 + b > c \\)\n      - \\( 1 + c > b \\)\n      - \\( b + c > 1 \\) (This one is naturally satisfied)\n    \n      Start by trying \\( b = 3 \\), then \\( c = 3 \\). We fulfill the inequality (1 + 3 > 3).\n\n    - Case 1: Sides are 1, 3, 3. This is a valid triangle.\n\n    - Let's increment in small steps: If \\( b = 2 \\), \\( c = 4 \\). Checks: \\( 1 + 2 > 4\\) is not satisfied.\n\n    - If \\( b = 4 \\), \\( c = 2 \\). As before, \\( 1 + 2 \\not> 4\\).\n\n    - Thus for \\( a = 1\\), the only candidate valid is 1, 3, 3.\n\n2. Try \\( a = 2 \\).\n\n    - Then \\( b + c = 5 \\).\n    - By inequalities:\n      - \\( 2 + b > c \\)\n      - \\( 2 + c > b \\)\n      - \\( b + c > 2 \\) (This one is naturally satisfied)\n    \n    - Let's consider \\( b = 2, c = 3 \\). Check: \\( 2 + 2 > 3\\) and \\( 2 + 3 > 2\\). Both hold true.\n\n    - Case 2: Sides are 2, 2, 3. This is a valid triangle.\n\n    -\\ If \\( b = 3, c = 2 \\), check: Same triangle as previously seen - equivalent to 2, 2, 3.\n\n3. Can \\( a = 3 \\) yield any outcome?\n\n    - Then \\( b + c = 4 \\). With inequalities:\n    \n    - \\( 3 + b > c \\), \\( 3 + c > b \\). Check valid combinations:\n    \n    - Let's consider \\( b = 1, c = 3 \\) or reversed does not allow valid ways to satisfy the inequality \\( 1 + 3 > 3 \\) (uses 1, 3, 3 again already considered).\n\n    - If \\( b = 2, c = 2 \\) reversing again gives us previously considered outcome.\n\nReflection:\n\nNow we've explored combinations locally, confirming the following distinct combinations:\n- Triangles with sides 1, 3, 3\n- Triangles with sides 2, 2, 3\n\nConclusion:\n\nReviewing all possibilities for integer side lengths within the perimeter constraint, we discover there are two non-congruent triangles that meet all the conditions of the problem: 1, 3, 3, and 2, 2, 3. The constraint exams guide us towards realizing no other side combinations fit inequality. Thus there are 2 non-congruent triangles with integer side lengths with perimeter 7.",

  "ground_truth": "The longest side cannot be greater than 3, since otherwise the remaining two sides would not be long enough to form a triangle. The only possible triangles have side lengths $1$--$3$--$3$ or $2$--$2$--$3$. Hence the answer is $\\boxed{2}.$"
