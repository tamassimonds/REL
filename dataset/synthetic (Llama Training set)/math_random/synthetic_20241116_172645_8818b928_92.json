    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step-by-step.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- I'm looking at the expression \\((x-a+3)\\) and I need to evaluate it when \\(x = (a+7)\\). \n- The core task seems to be substituting \\(x\\) with \\((a+7)\\) and simplifying the expression. \n- Initially, this seems to remind me of problems where substitution is key, and I'm curious if anything else might be hiding under the surface that I might miss on the first pass.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Requirement**\n\n- I need to replace \\(x\\) in the expression with the provided value.\n- So I need to rewrite \\(x\\); \\((x-a+3)\\) becomes \\((a+7-a+3)\\).\n\n**Step 2: Substitution**\n\n- I'll now substitute \\(x\\) in the expression: \n\n  \\[\n  (x-a+3) \\rightarrow ((a+7)-a+3)\n  \\]\n\n- After substituting, the expression simplifies to \\((a+7-a+3)\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplifying**\n\n- Now, let's simplify the expression \\((a+7-a+3)\\).\n- First, I notice \\(a-a\\) in the expression, which is zero.\n\n  \\[\n  (a+7-a+3) \\rightarrow (7+3)\n  \\]\n\n- Now, it simplifies down to \\(7+3\\).\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Result**\n\n- Finally, I calculate \\(7+3\\), which results in \\(10\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I think the approach was straightforward \u2014 focusing on substitution and simplifying. \n- There were no mistakes or dead ends encountered in the process.\n- I'll make a quick check: I haven't skipped any algebraic rules, and each direct simplification has been correct.\n\n**Concluding Thoughts:**\n\n- Everything seems correct \u2014 the expression simplifies clearly to \\(10\\).\n- There weren't any unexpected complications, so I'm confident in the simplicity of the solution.\n\nSo, the evaluated expression \\((x-a+3)\\) for \\(x = (a+7)\\) is \\(10\\).",
