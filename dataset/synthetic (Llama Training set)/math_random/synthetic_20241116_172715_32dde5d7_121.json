    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- Okay, we have two line segments here. Segment \\( s_1 \\) has known endpoints at \\((4, 1)\\) and \\((-8, 5)\\).\n- Segment \\( s_2 \\) is the translated version of \\( s_1 \\), moved 2 units to the right and 3 units up.\n- Finding the midpoint of \\( s_2 \\) involves finding the new endpoints and then using the midpoint formula.\n\nBrainstorming:\n- Could approach it by first translating each endpoint and then finding the midpoint as a final step.\n- Another approach could be calculating the midpoint of \\( s_1 \\) first, then translate that midpoint directly.\n- Translating both endpoints seems straightforward, so I'll start there and see if it all checks out.\n\nTranslating Points:\n- Let's translate \\((4, 1)\\) by 2 units right and 3 units up. That becomes:\n  \\[\n  (4 + 2, 1 + 3) = (6, 4)\n  \\]\n- Next, for \\((-8, 5)\\), the translation gives:\n  \\[\n  (-8 + 2, 5 + 3) = (-6, 8)\n  \\]\n  \nTranslation seems right since adding to both coordinates makes sense. Run a quick check.\n\n- Yes, it matches our translation rules: right means \\(x + 2\\) and up means \\(y + 3\\).\n\nChecking calculations quickly:\n- \\(4 + 2 = 6\\) and \\(1 + 3 = 4\\), seems fine for point 1.\n- \\(-8 + 2 = -6\\) and \\(5 + 3 = 8\\), holds for point 2.\n- All looks alright so far on this front.\n\nFinding the Midpoint:\n- Midpoint formula for endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is:\n  \\[\n  \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)\n  \\]\n- Plug in translated endpoints \\((6, 4)\\) and \\((-6, 8)\\):\n  \\[\n  \\left( \\frac{6 + (-6)}{2}, \\frac{4 + 8}{2} \\right)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\left( \\frac{0}{2}, \\frac{12}{2} \\right) = (0, 6)\n  \\]\n\nReflecting on Approaches:\n- Translated each endpoint correctly.\n- Used the midpoint formula properly.\n- Seemed efficient enough for this problem: finding endpoints first, then midpoint.\n  \nDouble-check the Result:\n- Midpoint (0, 6) aligns with calculations.\n- Each point translation recalculation was correct.\n- Final check: could a potential different method be faster? Not really in this case, since we need specific new positions first to find the midpoint.\n\nConclusion:\n- All steps solid: transformed points properly, calculated typically.\n- Confident the midpoint of segment \\( s_2 \\) is \\((0, 6)\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The midpoint of segment $s_1$ can be found using the midpoint formula: $\\left(\\frac{4-8}2,\\frac{1+5}2\\right)=(-2,3).$  The midpoint of $s_2$ is the translation of the midpoint of $s_1$ be $2$ units to the right and $3$ units up.  Thus its coordinates are $(-2+2,3+3)=\\boxed{(0,6)}.$"
