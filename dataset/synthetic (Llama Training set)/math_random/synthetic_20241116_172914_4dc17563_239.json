    "working_out": "First thoughts: When I first look at this problem, I notice that it's asking for the value of an expression involving exponents and fractions: \\(\\frac{1}{2}x^6y^7\\). It seems straightforward, where we need to plug in the given \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) values. \n\nThe given values are:\n- \\(x = \\frac{3}{4}\\)\n- \\(y = \\frac{4}{3}\\)\n\nThis looks similar to other problems I've done with exponents, so I'm feeling confident about my approach. But let's brainstorm multiple strategies to ensure we're on the right path:  \n\n1. Substitute \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into \\(\\frac{1}{2}x^6y^7\\) directly.\n2. Calculate each term individually, like \\(x^6\\) and \\(y^7\\), before combining.  \n\nHmm, let's go with the second approach and break it down step-by-step, as calculating powers of fractions might seem cumbersome at first glance. So, taking it step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\(x^6 = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^6\\)\n\n- \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^6\\) means we multiply \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) by itself six times. I could expand it, but let's use quick powers.\n- \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^6 = \\frac{3^6}{4^6}\\).\n- Calculate \\(3^6\\): \\(3^6 = 729\\).\n- Calculate \\(4^6\\): \\(4^6 = 4096\\).\n- So, \\(x^6 = \\frac{729}{4096}\\).\n\nLet's pause and reflect... That seems right. Simplifying isn't necessary here as we proceed further with computations.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\(y^7 = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^7\\)\n\n- \\(\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^7\\) is \\( \\frac{4^7}{3^7}\\).\n- Calculate \\(4^7\\): \\(4^7 = 16384\\).\n- Calculate \\(3^7\\): \\(3^7 = 2187\\).\n- So, \\(y^7 = \\frac{16384}{2187}\\).\n\nAgain, should verify these calculations feel right... Yep. Now, check seems appropriate because the numbers are plausible given powers growing rapidly.\n\n### Step 3: Combine and calculate \\(\\frac{1}{2}x^6y^7 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{729}{4096} \\times \\frac{16384}{2187}\\)\n\n- Multiply the fractions: \\(\\frac{729 \\times 16384}{4096 \\times 2187}\\).\n- Do I simplify now or later? Better to multiply and simplify.\n- Calculate \\( (729 \\times 16384)\\): This seems tedious but necessary:  \n   - \\(729 \\times 16384 = 11943936\\).\n- Calculate \\((4096 \\times 2187)\\):\n   - \\(4096 \\times 2187 = 8957952\\).\n\nNow that feels like a big jump. I'll double-check the math: Approximating a rough sense by simplifying both numbers by their highest possible square might help. Let us move forward:\n\n### Step 4: Final step with \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n- \\(\\frac{11943936}{8957952}\\) is indeed large. Definitely verify or simplify.\n- But we need \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of that:\n   \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{11943936}{8957952} = \\frac{11943936}{2 \\times 8957952}\\).\n   - Simplifies should yield \\(\\frac{5966968}{8957952} \\approx \\frac{4}{3}\\).\n\nReflect and summarize: Step-through made each computation feel large but not implausible, keeping check refined. Fractions' calculations confirmed expected \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\). It fits when reflecting through sanity of rational numbers and typical exponents behavior.\n\nFinal result:\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}x^6y^7 = \\frac{4}{3}\\). This should be correct, given correct operations and verification run. Excellent, satisfying problem\u2019s resolution!\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial calculations. Let's revisit the problem with a fresh perspective and ensure we're on the right track this time. \n\nFirst, let's go over the expression again: \\(\\frac{1}{2}x^6y^7\\), where \\(x = \\frac{3}{4}\\) and \\(y = \\frac{4}{3}\\). We need to simplify \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^6\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^7\\).\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Simplifying Exponents Before Multiplying**\n\nInstead of directly computing large powers, let's simplify the expression before multiplying.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Expression with Exponents\n\nNotice:\n\n- \\(\\frac{3^6}{3^7} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) because \\(3^6\\) and \\(3^7\\) have a common base, the expression simplifies to \\(3^{-1} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n- \\(\\frac{4^7}{4^6} = 4\\) for similar reasons, as it simplifies to \\(4^1 = 4\\).\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Combined Terms\n\nNow we can substitute these back into the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Alternative Perspective: Observing the Product of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n\nSince \\(x = \\frac{3}{4}\\) and \\(y = \\frac{4}{3}\\), note that:\n\n\\[\nxy = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = 1\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\((xy)^6 = 1^6 = 1\\). Thus, \\(\\frac{1}{2}x^6y^7 = \\frac{1}{2}(xy)^6y = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot y = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\).\n\nAnd again, that simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nReflecting on my previous steps, simplifying the exponents before multiplying made the process much clearer and manageable. Both methods lead to the final answer: \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). This systematic approach not only helped correct my error but also provided a more intuitive understanding of the operations involved.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial calculations.

We need to simplify \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^6\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^7\\).\n\n### Re-evaluating the Problem\n\nUpon reflecting on my previous approach, I realize I embarked on a rather lengthy computation, which wasn't necessary. Let's attempt to simplify the exponents before multiplying, ensuring a more straightforward solution.\n\n### Alternative Strategy: Simplifying Exponents Before Multiplying\n\nInstead of directly computing large powers, let's simplify the expression before multiplying.\n\n1. **Observe the Simplification in Exponents**:\n\n   Notice:\n\n   - \\(\\frac{3^6}{3^7} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) because \\(3^6\\) and \\(3^7\\) have a common base, the expression simplifies to \\(3^{-1} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n   - \\(\\frac{4^7}{4^6} = 4\\) for similar reasons, as it simplifies to \\(4^1 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Substitute Back into the Expression**:\n\n   Now we can substitute these back into the expression:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 4\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying this:\n\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n### Cross-Checking with an Alternative Perspective\n\nI should also consider another strategy to see if it leads to the same result, reinforcing the correctness of the solution:\n\n- **Observing the Product of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)**:\n  \n  Since \\(x = \\frac{3}{4}\\) and \\(y = \\frac{4}{3}\\), note that:\n\n  \\[\n  xy = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = 1\n  \\]\n\n  Therefore, \\((xy)^6 = 1^6 = 1\\). Thus, \\(\\frac{1}{2}x^6y^7 = \\frac{1}{2}(xy)^6y = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot y = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\).\n\n  And again, that simplifies to:\n\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{2}{3}\n  \\]\n\nUpon revisiting the problem and simplifying the process, both methods converge to the final and correct answer: \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). This systematic approach not only helped correct my error but also provided a more intuitive understanding of the operations involved. The consistency across different methods reassures me of the accuracy of this solution.",
