Or perhaps just mental arithmetic?\n    - Could also try a more intuitive approach, guessing numbers whose sum is 30 and checking if their difference is 4. \n\n**Brainstorming a Strategy:**\n\n1. **Algebra Setup**:\n    - Let's assign variables: Let \\(x\\) be the larger number and \\(y\\) be the smaller number.\n    - Write down equations:\n      - Equation 1: \\(x + y = 30\\)\n      - Equation 2: \\(x - y = 4\\)\n    - This gives me a system of linear equations. Simultaneous equations! Okay, let's solve this algebraically.\n\n**Solving the Equations:**\n\n1. **Using Elimination Method**:\n    - Add Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n      \\[\n      (x + y) + (x - y) = 30 + 4\n      \\]\n      \\[\n      2x = 34\n      \\]\n    - Solve for \\(x\\):\n      \\[\n      x = \\frac{34}{2} = 17\n      \\]\n    - Now, substitute \\(x = 17\\) back into Equation 1 to find \\(y\\):\n      \\[\n      17 + y = 30\n      \\]\n      \\[\n      y = 30 - 17 = 13\n      \\]\n    - So, the numbers are \\(x = 17\\) and \\(y = 13\\).\n\n**Check the Solution:**\n\n1. **Verification**:\n    - Check if the sum is correct: \\(17 + 13 = 30\\). Yes.\n    - Check if the difference is correct: \\(17 - 13 = 4\\). Yes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n1. **Final Thought**:\n    - The larger number is 17. This method of solving simultaneous equations works well here.\n\nReflecting on this process, the algebraic approach was clean and effective. It quickly gave me the numbers I needed by solving the system of equations. Although I considered trying out mental arithmetic or guessing numbers, using formal algebra was definitely advantageous in ensuring accuracy and understanding. Plus, verifying the results assures me the solution is reliable.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x,y$ be the larger and smaller numbers, respectively. We have $x+y=30$ and $x-y=4$. Thus: $x=\\frac{1}{2}((x+y)+(x-y))=\\frac{1}{2}(30+4)=\\boxed{17}$."
