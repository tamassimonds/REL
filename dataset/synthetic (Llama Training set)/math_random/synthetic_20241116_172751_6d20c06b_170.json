    "working_out": "Alright, let's jump into this problem step by step, unpacking my thought process as we go.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, initially I see this statement: \"Two more than three times $B$ is equal to 20.\" This sounds like a classic algebra problem where I need to find the value of an unknown variable, B. I'm being reminded of equations where I have to isolate the variable. But well, let's first make sure we're interpreting this correctly.\n\nBrainstorming how to translate this to math, it sounds like we're dealing with an equation format like \"3 times something plus 2 equals 20.\"\n\n**Translating to an Equation:**\nIf I phrase it mathematically: \"two more than three times $B$\" can be translated into `3B + 2`. I have to remind myself that \"two more than\" means we're adding 2 to whatever comes before. And it's stated to equal 20.\n\nSo I'm writing down the equation based on this interpretation:\n\\[ 3B + 2 = 20 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nDoes this setup make sense? Yes, adding 2 to 3 times $B$ to get 20 is a reasonable interpretation of \"Two more than three times $B$ is equal to 20.\"\n\nNow, to find B, I need to solve this equation.\n \n**Step-by-step Solving:**\n1. **Subtract 2 from both sides:**\n   \\[ 3B + 2 - 2 = 20 - 2 \\]\n   That simplifies to:\n   \\[ 3B = 18 \\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 3 to isolate B:**\n   \\[ \\frac{3B}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[ B = 6 \\]\n\n**Checking the Solution:**\nLet's verify by plugging B back into the original equation idea:\n- Three times $6$ gives $18$.\n- Adding 2 gives $20$, which matches perfectly with the original condition: \"Two more than three times $B$ is equal to 20.\"\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nThe approach seems correct because the solution logically checks out. I'm confident the value of \\( B \\) is \\( 6 \\). Let's reflect: Nothing felt off about the approach, and each step logically followed from the previous one, maintaining balance in the equation till we isolated the variable. Everything aligns perfectly! \n\nBy translating the words into math, solving the equation, and validating the solution, the problem unfolds cleanly.",
