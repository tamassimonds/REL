    "working_out": "Okay, let's start. We're trying to convert the point \\((1, -\\sqrt{3})\\) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. This is a common transformation that involves some trigonometry. Right off the bat, I remember that in polar coordinates, \\(r\\) is the distance from the origin and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle from the positive x-axis. Let\u2019s break this down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given rectangular coordinates.**\n\nWe're given the point \\((1, -\\sqrt{3})\\). This means \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = -\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate \\(r\\).**\n\nOkay, I remember that the formula to find \\(r\\) (the distance from the origin) in polar coordinates is:\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\]\n\nLet me plug in the values:\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-\\sqrt{3})^2} \\]\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{1 + 3} = \\sqrt{4} = 2 \\]\n\nQuickly reflect: This seems right. We used the distance formula correctly and kept the signs in check. Let's move on.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate \\(\\theta\\).**\n\nNow we need to find \\(\\theta\\), the angle. The formula to calculate \\(\\theta\\) typically involved is:\n\\[ \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) \\]\n\nFor our point:\n\\[ \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-\\sqrt{3}}{1}\\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\tan^{-1}(-\\sqrt{3}) \\]\n\nI realize \\(\\tan^{-1}(-\\sqrt{3})\\) is one of those standard angles, and hmm, thinking about it\u2026 A tangent of \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\) reminds me of \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), as \\(\\tan(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\sqrt{3}\\). \n\nReflecting: But wait, since this point \\((1, -\\sqrt{3})\\) lies in the fourth quadrant (positive x and negative y), I should adjust \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) by adding \\(\\pi\\) or \\(2\\pi\\) to make it positive and adjust to the correct quadrant. \n\nLet\u2019s calculate \\(\\theta\\) again:\n\\[ \\theta = 2\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{6\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{5\\pi}{3} \\]\n\nReflect: \\(\\theta = \\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\) seems correct since we're in the fourth quadrant. Good, this seems consistent.\n\n**Step 4: Write down the polar coordinates.**\n\nThe polar coordinates should be \\((r, \\theta)\\):\n\\[ r = 2 \\]\n\\[ \\theta = \\frac{5\\pi}{3} \\]\n\nFinal Check: Let\u2019s double check everything once more \u2013 \\(r\\) looks accurate and \\(\\theta\\) properly accounts for the quadrant. Everything aligns, so the final polar coordinates are:\n\\[ (2, \\frac{5\\pi}{3}) \\]\n\nGreat! That was a good exercise in using polar transformations and considering the quadrant effects on \\(\\theta\\).",
