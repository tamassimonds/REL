    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- Okay, the problem is asking for the arithmetic mean of reciprocals of the first three prime numbers. \n- I know the first three prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5.\n- An arithmetic mean is just an average, right? So I should be dividing the sum of the reciprocals by how many numbers there are.\n- Wait, reciprocals... that's just 1 divided by the number, so I need 1/2, 1/3, and 1/5.\n\nWhere to Start:\n- I guess I'll start by calculating each reciprocal: \n  - \\(1/2 = 0.5\\)\n  - \\(1/3 = 0.333...\\)\n  - \\(1/5 = 0.2\\)\n- So I add these up and then divide by 3 since there are three numbers.\n\nCalculations:\n1. Calculating the sum of the reciprocals:\n   - \\(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5\\)\n   - Oh right, I need a common denominator to add these fractions. The common denominator for 2, 3, and 5 would be 30. \n\n2. Converting each fraction to have 30 as the denominator:\n   - \\(1/2 = 15/30\\)\n   - \\(1/3 = 10/30\\)\n   - \\(1/5 = 6/30\\)\n\n3. Adding these together:\n   - \\(15/30 + 10/30 + 6/30 = 31/30\\)\n\n4. Dividing by 3 to get the mean:\n   - This part seems a little tricky because I have to divide a fraction by a whole number.\n   - \\(31/30 \\div 3\\) is the same as \\(31/30 \\times 1/3\\)\n   - So \\(31/30 \\times 1/3 = 31/90\\)\n\nCheck Work:\n- Okay, so let me check if this makes sense... Hmm, 31/90 as a decimal \n  - When I convert this to a decimal, \\(31 \\div 90 \\approx 0.3444...\\)\n- This seems okay because the average should be between the smallest and the largest reciprocals (0.2 and 0.5).\n  \nRandom Thoughts:\n- Hmm, maybe my approach is correct because I'm getting a result that makes sense.\n- There isn\u2019t really another way to find the arithmetic mean besides summing and dividing, so this process looks solid.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n- I feel confident in this solution, and my steps seem correct.\n- The arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the first three prime numbers is \\(31/90\\) or approximately 0.3444. \n- I think this is a reasonable answer.",

  "ground_truth": "The first three prime numbers are $2$, $3$, and $5$, and their reciprocals are $1/2$, $1/3$, and $1/5$ respectively. To find the mean of these three numbers, we must first find their sum and then divide that sum by $3$. To find the sum of $1/2$, $1/3$, and $1/5$, we first place each fraction over their least common denominator of $30$. Thus, we have that $$\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{15}{30} + \\frac{10}{30} + \\frac{6}{30} = \\frac{31}{30}.$$\n\nDividing $\\frac{31}{30}$ by $3$, we get that the mean of these three numbers is $\\frac{31}{30 \\cdot 3} = \\boxed{\\frac{31}{90}}$."
