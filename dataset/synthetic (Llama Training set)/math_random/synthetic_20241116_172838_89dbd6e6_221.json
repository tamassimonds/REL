    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about the probability of getting two tails and one head when tossing three coins. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so when I see this problem, my mind immediately goes to basic probability. I know each coin has two sides: heads (H) and tails (T). Since we are tossing three coins, I'm thinking about all the possible outcomes. I vaguely remember working with these kinds of problems before, maybe something about combinations?\n\n**Brainstorming a Strategy:**\n\n1. One way I can approach this is by listing all the possible outcomes when three coins are tossed. Since each coin has two possibilities, there should be a few outcomes to consider.\n\n2. Another thought is using combinations or permutations since we're dealing with distinct events (two tails and one head). But wait, combinations might be the way to go because the order of tails and heads among the coins doesn\u2019t matter too much for counting purposes.\n\n3. A quick way to visualize could be a probability tree or maybe a table, but listing or direct calculation might be faster in this case.\n\nOkay, let's try the first strategy: listing all outcomes.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n**Step 1: List all possible outcomes.**\n\nEach coin has two possible outcomes (head H or tail T). If I'm tossing three coins, the possibilities are:\n\n- HHH\n- HHT\n- HTH\n- THH\n- TTH\n- THT\n- HTT\n- TTT\n\nSo there are 8 possible outcomes in total. This seems reasonable because \\(2^3 = 8\\) possibilities for three coins.\n\n**Check**: Did I list them all? Yep, by counting permutations of three coins, there should be 8.\n\n**Step 2: Identify outcomes with exactly two tails and one head.**\n\nFrom my listing:\n- HHT\n- HTH\n- THH\n\nThese three outcomes have two heads and one tail, which isn't correct. I need two tails and one head.\n\nSo correct list for two tails, one head:\n- TTH\n- THT\n- HTT\n\nOkay! These are the correct ones. \n\n**Check**: Do these outcomes indeed have exactly two tails and one head? Yes, they fit the condition exactly.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability.**\n\nNow that I've identified there are 3 favorable outcomes (TTH, THT, HTT), the probability can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me think if this makes sense: Since there are 8 possible combinations in total when tossing three coins, and I've found 3 instances where there are exactly two tails and one head, the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) seems both reasonable and correct.\n\nThis looks solid. No calculations feel off, and my logical steps seem intact. I've checked my list of outcomes against what is possible with three tossed coins, and the count adds up correctly.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting two tails and one head when three coins are tossed is \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The probability of getting two tails followed by one head is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.  The probability of getting a tail followed by a head followed by a tail is also $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.  Finally, the probability of getting a head followed by two tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$ as well.  In total, the probability of getting two tails and one head is $\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$."
