    "working_out": "**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. We're looking for integers between 100 and 300 that are divisible by both 11 and 8. When I initially read this, I'm reminded of problems involving least common multiples or finding numbers in a range that share multiple factors. \n\nWhat immediately comes to mind is the least common multiple (LCM). If a number is divisible by both 11 and 8, then it must be divisible by their LCM. This seems like a good starting point.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Find the LCM of 11 and 8**\n\nBoth 11 and 8 are integers. 11 is a prime number, so it doesn't have any factors except for 1 and itself. 8 is \\(2^3\\). So, their LCM must be \\(11 \\times 8 = 88\\).\n\n**Reflection:** That seems correct. Since they don\u2019t share any factors other than 1, multiplying them should give us the LCM. Let's proceed with this.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Determine multiples of 88 between 100 and 300**\n\nTo find numbers divisible by 88, they must be multiples of 88. So, let's find the smallest multiple of 88 greater than or equal to 100 and the largest less than or equal to 300.\n\n1. **Find the smallest multiple of 88 greater than 100:**\n   - Start by dividing: 100 \u00f7 88 \u2248 1.136\n   - The ceiling of this division gives us the smallest integer greater than 1.136, which is 2.\n   - Thus, the smallest multiple of 88 beyond 100 is \\(88 \\times 2 = 176\\).\n\n2. **Find the largest multiple of 88 less than 300:**\n   - Start by dividing: 300 \u00f7 88 \u2248 3.409\n   - The floor of this division gives us the largest integer less than 3.409, which is 3.\n   - Thus, the largest multiple of 88 less than 300 is \\(88 \\times 3 = 264\\).\n\n**Reflection:** These calculations seem fine. Let's list the multiples between 176 and 264.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: List the integers**\n\nNow, let's list the relevant multiples:\n- Start at 176\n- Increase by 88 each step\n\nSo, the multiples of 88 from 176 to 264 are:\n1. 176\n2. 264\n\n**Quick Check:** \n- 176 \u00f7 88 = 2\n- 264 \u00f7 88 = 3\nThese are all integers, confirming they are multiples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Count the integers**\n\nCount the numbers listed: 176, 264. There are exactly 2 numbers.\n\n**Reflection:** I feel confident this is correct. The logic with LCM and checking the bounds seems solid. Counting was straightforward, and quick checks indicate no errors.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere are 2 integers between 100 and 300 that have both 11 and 8 as factors: 176 and 264.",

  "ground_truth": "The only numbers that have 11 and 8 as a factor are multiples of 88.  If we list the first few multiples of 88: $$88,176,264,352,...$$ we can see that there are exactly $\\boxed{2}$ between 100 and 300."
