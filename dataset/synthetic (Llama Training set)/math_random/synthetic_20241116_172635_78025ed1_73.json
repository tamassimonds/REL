    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. This involves a geometric sequence, and such problems usually have a common pattern. Let's explore the steps one at a time, checking our logic and solving as we go.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\n**First Thoughts**: We have a sequence: \\(3\\), \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{27}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{81}{8}\\), \\ldots. The sequence appears to multiply by some fraction to get from one term to the next. Geometric sequences have a common ratio, which will help us navigate from one term to the next until we reach the eighth term.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Common Ratio\n\n**Brainstorming**: Okay, let's see. The first term, \\(a_1 = 3\\), and the second term, \\(a_2 = \\frac{9}{2}\\). If we find the common ratio (\\(r\\)), we can express each term as a power of this ratio multiplied by the first term.\n\n**Calculations**:\n- To find the common ratio \\(r\\), we can divide the second term by the first term:\n\n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{2}}{3}\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplify**: \\(\\frac{\\frac{9}{2}}{3} = \\frac{9}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{9}{6} = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n**Reflection**: Okay, the common ratio \\(r = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Common Ratio\n\n**Verification**: We should verify this by checking the next terms:\n\n- Check the third term:\n  \\[\n  a_3 = a_2 \\times r = \\frac{9}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{27}{4}\n  \\]\n  Yep, that matches our sequence.\n\n- Check the fourth term:\n  \\[\n  a_4 = a_3 \\times r = \\frac{27}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{81}{8}\n  \\]\n  Perfect, this also matches.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Eighth Term\n\n**Oh! Now, we\u2019re ready**: We need the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of a geometric sequence: \n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 \\times r^{n-1}\n\\]\n\n- We want \\(a_8\\), so:\n  \\[\n  a_8 = 3 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{7}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculating \\(r^7\\)**:\n- Let's calculate \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7\\). We'll break it down step by step:\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right) \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{27}{8}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{27}{8} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{81}{16}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{81}{16} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{243}{32}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{243}{32} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{729}{64}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7 = \\frac{729}{64} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{2187}{128}\n  \\]\n\n**Final Calculation**:\n- Now substitute back:\n  \\[\n  a_8 = 3 \\times \\frac{2187}{128} = \\frac{6561}{128}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection Check**: Let's ensure this fraction is simplified. It seems \\( \\frac{6561}{128} \\) is already in its simplest form because these numbers do not have common factors greater than 1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe eighth term of the sequence is \\(\\frac{6561}{128}\\). Double-checking the calculations and ensuring step-by-step accuracy boosts our confidence that this answer is correct.",

  "ground_truth": "The first term is $3$, and the ratio between terms is $(9/2)/3=3/2$. Therefore, the eighth term of the sequence is $3\\cdot(3/2)^{8-1} = 3^8/2^7 = \\boxed{\\frac{6561}{128}}$."
