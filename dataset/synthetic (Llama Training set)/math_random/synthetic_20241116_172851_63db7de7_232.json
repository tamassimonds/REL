    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem: \n\n**Initial Understanding**:  \nThe question asks us to find how many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when used to divide 47. \n\nAt first glance, it seems similar to problems about divisors and congruences. The condition of leaving a remainder of 5 means that if we divide 47 by such a number \\( n \\), the expression looks like:\n\n\\[ 47 \\equiv 5 \\ (\\text{mod } n) \\]\n\nRearranging, this means:\n\n\\[ 47 = kn + 5 \\]\n\nfor some integer \\( k \\), and we're searching for positive integer values of \\( n \\).  \n\n**Exploring Strategies**:  \n1. **Rewriting the Equation**: Let's think about this equation: \\( 47 = kn + 5 \\). Rearranging gives us:\n\n\\[ kn = 47 - 5 = 42 \\]\n\nNow, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 42 because \\( n \\) divides \\( kn \\), which equals 42. That's a good insight - let's follow this trail.\n\n2. **Finding Divisors of 42**: So, our task reduces to finding the divisors of 42. Here are the divisors of 42 by testing divisibility:\n\n   - Divisible by 1\n   - Divisible by 2 (since it\u2019s even)\n   - Divisible by 3 (sum of digits, 4+2=6, divisible by 3)\n   - Divisible by 6 (2 & 3 both divide it)\n   - Divisible by 7 (43/7 = 6 with no remainder)\n   - Divisible by 14 (product of 2 and 7)\n   - Divisible by 21 (product of 3 and 7)\n   - Divisible by 42 (itself)\n\nThe full list of divisors is: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.\n\n3. **Exclude Divisors Less Than 5**: We need \\( n > 5 \\) since we need a remainder of 5. So, we exclude 1, 2, 3, and 4 from potential divisors.\n\n4. **Checking Larger Divisors**: We need to check which of these numbers could satisfy leaving a remainder of 5 when dividing 47. Now among the divisors:\n\n   - **Testing 6**: \\( 47 \\equiv 5 \\ (\\text{mod } 6) \\) because \\( 47 = 7*6 + 5 \\)\n   - **Testing 7**: \\( 47 \\equiv 5 \\ (\\text{mod } 7) \\) because \\( 47 = 6*7 + 5 \\)\n   - **Testing 14**: \\( 47 \\equiv 5 \\ (\\text{mod } 14) \\) because \\( 47 = 3*14 + 5 \\)\n   - **Testing 21**: \\( 47 \\equiv 5 \\ (\\text{mod } 21) \\) because \\( 47 = 2*21 + 5 \\)\n   - **Testing 42**: \\( 47 \\equiv 5 \\ (\\text{mod } 42) \\) because \\( 47 = 1*42 + 5 \\)\n\n5. **Count Valid Divisors**: From the calculations above, the valid divisors leaving a remainder of 5 are: 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.\n\n**Final Check**:  \nLet's review these divisors. All satisfy \\( 47 = kn + 5 \\) for some \\( k \\). Thus, the count of such divisors is 5: 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe number of different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when dividing into 47 is 5. This feels consistent with my initial strategy and checks out upon reflection. Cool, on to the next problem!",

  "ground_truth": "For a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, it must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. it must divide exactly into $47 - 5$, or 42, and\n\n2. it must be greater than 5, because the divisor is always greater than the remainder.\n\nWe list all divisors of 42 in pairs. They are 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3 and 14, 6 and 7. Of these, only 42, 21, 14, 6, and 7 are greater than 5. There are $\\boxed{5}$ different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47."
