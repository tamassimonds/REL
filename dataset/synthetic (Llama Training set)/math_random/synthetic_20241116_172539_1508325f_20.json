    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nI'm looking at a piecewise function, \\( f(x) \\), with two different expressions depending on the value of \\( x \\). I need to find the value of \\( f(-7) \\). \n\n### Step 2: Recognize the Relevant Case\nNow at \\( x = -7 \\), I have to decide which piece of the function to use. Two conditions to consider:\n- If \\( x < -2 \\), use \\( f(x) = 2x + 9 \\).\n- If \\( x \\geq -2 \\), use \\( f(x) = 5 - 2x \\).\n\nSince \\(-7\\) is less than \\(-2\\), I need to use the first condition. This is important: I don't want to mix up the conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Appropriate Function\nGiven that \\(-7 < -2\\), the function simplifies to:\n\\[ f(x) = 2x + 9 \\]\n\nLet's substitute \\( x = -7 \\) into this expression:\n\\[ f(-7) = 2(-7) + 9 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate\nNow, I'll perform the arithmetic for \\( f(-7) \\):\n\\[ f(-7) = 2(-7) + 9 \\]\n\\[ = -14 + 9 \\]\n\\[ = -5 \\]\n\nWait, let's double-check these calculations to make sure I don't just make a quick assumption. \n\n### Step 5: Reflect and Verify\nI've calculated it step by step:\n1. Multiply: \\( 2 \\times -7 = -14 \\)\n2. Add: \\(-14 + 9 = -5\\)\n\nEverything seems in order. The logic aligns perfectly with the constraints of the piecewise function. Concluding this check, the calculations seem consistent and accurate.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe value of \\( f(-7) \\) is \\(-5\\).\n\nIt's always good to reflect on each step and ensure that the part of the function used to solve it was correct, especially when dealing with piecewise functions where it\u2019s crucial to evaluate which case applies. This helps in avoiding any mixing up of the function pieces.",
