    "working_out": "Alright, here we go! This problem involves understanding probability combined with some geometric intuition about forming triangles. Let's dive into it step by step, thinking through the different aspects of the problem just like I would if I were doing this on paper.\n\n### Understanding the Problem:\nWe have seven different stick lengths: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17 inches. We need to choose three sticks randomly and determine the probability that these sticks can form a triangle. \n\nFrom geometry, I know that three lengths can form a triangle if the sum of the two shortest sides is greater than the longest side. I'll keep this in mind as I work through the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Possible Combinations\nFirst, let's figure out how many ways we can choose three sticks from seven. We can use combinations for this.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35 \\]\n\nThis gives us a total of 35 different combinations of sticks.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Valid Triangle Conditions\nNext, let's consider the condition for forming a triangle: for any selected lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) (where \\(a \\leq b \\leq c\\)), the triangle inequality \\(a + b > c\\) must hold.\n\n### Step 3: Check each Combination for Validity\nI will list all combinations of the three sticks and see which satisfy the triangle inequality condition. We should work through these systematically:\n\n1. **2, 3, 5**: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) \u2014 not greater than 5. No triangle.\n2. **2, 3, 7**: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) \u2014 not greater than 7. No triangle.\n3. **2, 3, 11**: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) \u2014 not greater than 11. No triangle.\n4. **2, 3, 13**: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) \u2014 not greater than 13. No triangle.\n5. **2, 3, 17**: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) \u2014 not greater than 17. No triangle.\n6. **2, 5, 7**: \\(2 + 5 = 7\\) \u2014 not greater than 7. No triangle.\n7. **2, 5, 11**: \\(2 + 5 = 7\\) \u2014 not greater than 11. No triangle.\n8. **2, 5, 13**: \\(2 + 5 = 7\\) \u2014 not greater than 13. No triangle.\n9. **2, 5, 17**: \\(2 + 5 = 7\\) \u2014 not greater than 17. No triangle.\n10. **2, 7, 11**: \\(2 + 7 = 9\\) \u2014 not greater than 11. No triangle.\n11. **2, 7, 13**: \\(2 + 7 = 9\\) \u2014 not greater than 13. No triangle.\n12. **2, 7, 17**: \\(2 + 7 = 9\\) \u2014 not greater than 17. No triangle.\n13. **2, 11, 13**: \\(2 + 11 = 13\\) \u2014 not greater than 13. No triangle.\n14. **2, 11, 17**: \\(2 + 11 = 13\\) \u2014 not greater than 17. No triangle.\n15. **2, 13, 17**: \\(2 + 13 = 15\\) \u2014 not greater than 17. No triangle.\n\n*(Hmm, none of these seem to be working so far. Let's try starting with larger numbers)*\n\n16. **3, 5, 7**: \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) \u2014 greater than 7. Triangle possible.\n17. **3, 5, 11**: \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) \u2014 not greater than 11. No triangle.\n18. **3, 5, 13**: \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) \u2014 not greater than 13. No triangle.\n19. **3, 5, 17**: \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) \u2014 not greater than 17. No triangle.\n20. **3, 7, 11**: \\(3 + 7 = 10\\) \u2014 not greater than 11. No triangle.\n21. **3, 7, 13**: \\(3 + 7 = 10\\) \u2014 not greater than 13. No triangle.\n22. **3, 7, 17**: \\(3 + 7 = 10\\) \u2014 not greater than 17. No triangle.\n23. **3, 11, 13**: \\(3 + 11 = 14\\) \u2014 greater than 13. Triangle possible.\n24. **3, 11, 17**: \\(3 + 11 = 14\\) \u2014 not greater than 17. No triangle.\n25. **3, 13, 17**: \\(3 + 13 = 16\\) \u2014 not greater than 17. No triangle.\n\n*(Aha! We found another valid group there! Let's keep looking!)*\n\n26. **5, 7, 11**: \\(5 + 7 = 12\\) \u2014 greater than 11. Triangle possible.\n27. **5, 7, 13**: \\(5 + 7 = 12\\) \u2014 not greater than 13. No triangle.\n28. **5, 7, 17**: \\(5 + 7 = 12\\) \u2014 not greater than 17. No triangle.\n29. **5, 11, 13**: \\(5 + 11 = 16\\) \u2014 greater than 13. Triangle possible.\n30. **5, 11, 17**: \\(5 + 11 = 16\\) \u2014 not greater than 17. No triangle.\n31. **5, 13, 17**: \\(5 + 13 = 18\\) \u2014 greater than 17. Triangle possible.\n\n*(Looks like more valid combinations are cropping up. Let's finish this!)*\n \n32. **7, 11, 13**: \\(7 + 11 = 18\\) \u2014 greater than 13. Triangle possible.\n33. **7, 11, 17**: \\(7 + 11 = 18\\) \u2014 greater than 17. Triangle possible.\n34. **7, 13, 17**: \\(7 + 13 = 20\\) \u2014 greater than 17. Triangle possible.\n35. **11, 13, 17**: \\(11 + 13 = 24\\) \u2014 greater than 17. Triangle possible.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Valid Combinations\nAfter checking each combination, I found that the following combinations can form a triangle:\n- {3, 5, 7}\n- {3, 11, 13}\n- {5, 7, 11}\n- {5, 11, 13}\n- {5, 13, 17}\n- {7, 11, 13}\n- {7, 11, 17}\n- {7, 13, 17}\n- {11, 13, 17}\n\nIn total, there are 9 valid combinations that can form a triangle.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Probability\nThe probability is the number of successful combinations divided by the total number of combinations:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{9}{35} \\]\n\n### Final Check\nGoing through each step, I've confirmed the total combinations are correct and made sure each triangle inequality condition was checked correctly. The computed probability makes sense given the setup. All seems to fit!\n\nThe probability that three randomly chosen sticks can form a triangle is \\(\\frac{9}{35}\\).\n\nThat's it! We've thoroughly checked our steps and reached a solution.",

  "ground_truth": "By the triangle inequality, three segments form a triangle if and only if the sum of the smaller two lengths exceeds the greatest length.  Therefore, if $2$ is one of the sticks drawn, then the three sticks cannot be used to form a triangle.  If 3 is the smallest length drawn, then the possible sets of sticks are (3,5,7) and (3,11,13).  If 5 is the smallest length drawn, then (5,7,11), (5,11,13), and (5,13,17) are the sets that satisfy the triangle inequality.  If 7 is the smallest length drawn, then (7,11,13), (7,11,17), (7,13,17) all satisfy the triangle inequality.  Finally, (11,13,17) satisfies the triangle inequality.  In total, there are $2+3+3+1=9$ sets of sticks that could be used to form a triangle.  There are $\\binom{7}{3}=35$ equally likely sets of 3 sticks, so the probability that one of the 9 sets that form a triangle will be chosen is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{35}}$."
