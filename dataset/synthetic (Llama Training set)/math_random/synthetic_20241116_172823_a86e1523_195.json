    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about angle \\( P \\) formed by extending sides of a regular hexagon. Here\u2019s how I would approach this step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe have a regular hexagon named \\( ABCDEF \\). Regular means all sides are equal, and all interior angles are equal. I\u2019ll extend two sides, \\(\\overline{AB}\\) and \\(\\overline{EF}\\), to meet at a point \\( P \\). The question asks for the measure of angle \\( P \\).\n\n### Step 2: Reflect and Brainstorm\nOkay, extending sides of a regular polygon seems like something potentially geometric. Regular hexagons have some rotational symmetry and specific angle properties that might help. I recall that the interior angles of a regular hexagon are each \\(120^\\circ\\). \n\n**Wait**, extending seems to form external angles, which feels related to the structure of the hexagon and its symmetries. No need to make assumptions yet, let\u2019s explore the regular hexagon properties first.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Regular Hexagon Properties\n- There are 6 interior angles, each \\(120^\\circ\\) because it\u2019s regular.\n- Each exterior angle of a polygon can be found using \\(180^\\circ -\\) interior angle \\(= 60^\\circ\\).\n\nFrom symmetry, I reason that extending any side of the hexagon outward forms equivalent external angles because of the regular intervals between each side and vertex.\n\n### Step 4: Sketch and Visualize\nLet\u2019s sketch the situation to get a clearer picture:\n- Draw a hexagon \\(ABCDEF\\). Extend \\(\\overline{AB}\\) past \\(B\\). Extend \\(\\overline{EF}\\) past \\(F\\) to meet \\(\\overline{AB}\\) at point \\(P\\).\n\n### Step 5: Analyze External Angles\nHere\u2019s where the symmetry of angles comes in handy:\n- Around point \\(B\\), \\(\\angle ABP\\) is an external angle of the hexagon, and it equals \\(60^\\circ\\).\n- Around point \\(F\\), \\(\\angle EFP\\) is also an external angle, so it equals \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Angle \\(P\\)\nThe angles \\(\\angle ABP\\) and \\(\\angle EFP\\) are known. Let\u2019s piece it together:\n- Angle \\(P\\) at the intersection will be the sum of \\(\\angle ABP\\) and \\(\\angle EFP\\).\n- Thus, \\(\\angle P = \\angle ABP + \\angle EFP = 60^\\circ + 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ\\).\n\n### Step 7: Quick Review\n- Are all angles correct? It seems logical from the geometry that the sum of these external angles leads directly to the angle at the intersection.\n- External angles formed at such constructions are consistent and straightforward here due to \\(180^\\circ\\) rotations in hexagons.\n- Double-checking: interior angles, external properties, and total checked. All math adds up.\n\n### Conclusion and Final Answer\nThe measure of angle \\( P \\) is \\(120^\\circ\\).\n\nWhile writing through and solving this, I kept confirming that each part of the hexagon\u2019s symmetry and angle properties were upheld. It confirms confidence in arriving at the final simplified answer.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution to the problem about the angle \\( P \\) formed by extending the sides of a regular hexagon. Let's revisit and re-evaluate our approach to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Rethink and Re-approach\nUpon reviewing the problem and my previous method, I see the misconception in calculating angle \\( P \\). My initial thought process was to sum external angles, which led me in the wrong direction. Let's re-examine the structure of the hexagon and find the correct strategy.\n\n### Consider a Different Strategy\nRegular hexagons have internal symmetry and a consistent angle structure. Let's leverage this strategically:\n\n1. **Hexagon Interior and External Angles**:\n   - The internal angle of each vertex in the hexagon is \\(120^\\circ\\).\n   - Therefore, when considering external angles or angles formed by extending sides, we must remember we are forming triangles, not just aligning external hexagon angles.\n\n2. **Form a Triangle**:\n   - Let's consider triangle \\( \\triangle APF \\) formed by points \\( A \\), \\( F \\), and \\( P \\).\n   - Calculate the angles at \\( A \\) and \\( F \\) that lead toward point \\( P \\).\n\n### Detailed Calculation\n- **Internal Angle at \\( A \\)**: \n  - If \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is extended to meet \\( \\overline{EF} \\), then the external angle at \\( A \\) from side \\( \\overline{FA} \\), which is part of triangle \\( \\triangle APF \\), is \\(60^\\circ\\) because it complements the internal angle.\n\n- **Internal Angle at \\( F \\)**:\n  - Similarly, the external angle when side \\( \\overline{EF} \\) extends is \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n### Compute Angle \\( P \\)\n- These two external angles at \\( A \\) and \\( F \\) contribute to the formation of \\( \\triangle APF \\).\n- The angle \\( \\angle APF \\) can be calculated because the sum of angles in a triangle is always \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n\\[\n\\angle APF = 180^\\circ - \\angle FAP - \\angle AFP = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 60^\\circ\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion and Final Answer\nUpon rigorous analysis, the degree measure of angle \\( P \\) is correctly found to be \\( \\boxed{60^\\circ} \\). This solution properly accounts for the structure of a regular hexagon and the properties of triangle angles, leading us to the correct answer.",

  "ground_truth": "The sum of the angle measures of a hexagon is $180(6-2) = 720$ degrees, so each angle of a regular hexagon measures $720^\\circ/6=120^\\circ$.  Therefore, $\\angle BAF = 120^\\circ$, which means $\\angle FAP = 180^\\circ - \\angle BAF = 60^\\circ$.  Similarly, $\\angle PFA = 60^\\circ$.  Since the angles of $\\triangle APF$ sum to $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle APF = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 60^\\circ = \\boxed{60^\\circ}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.6inch);\npair A,B,C,D,EE,F,P;\n\nA = (1,0);\nB = rotate(60)*A;\nC=rotate(60)*B;\nD = rotate(60)*C;\nEE = rotate(60)*D;\nF = rotate(60)*EE;\n\nP = A + (A - B);\ndraw (A--B--C--D--EE--F--A--P--F,linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,W);\nlabel(\"$E$\",EE,S);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,S);\n[/asy]"
