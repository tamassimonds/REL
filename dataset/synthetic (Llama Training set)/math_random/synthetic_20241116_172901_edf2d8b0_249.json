    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and break it down. We need to find the value of \\( a \\) such that the quadratic expression \\( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \\) can be expressed as the square of a binomial. Here\u2019s how I'll approach the problem, brainstorming various strategies and verifying each step as we go:\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Exploration\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - I need to find \\( a \\) such that \\( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \\) equals the square of a binomial. \n   - If \\( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \\) is a perfect square of a binomial, it can be expressed in the form \\((px + q)^2\\).\n\n2. **Express the Binomial Square**:\n   - We know that \\((px + q)^2 = p^2x^2 + 2pqx + q^2\\).\n   - Looking at \\((px + q)^2\\), the expression \\( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \\) should match this form:\n     - \\( ax^2 = p^2x^2\\)\n     - \\( 12x = 2pqx\\)\n     - \\( 9 = q^2\\)\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n3. **Matching the Terms**:\n   - First, observe the constant term: \\( q^2 = 9 \\). So, \\( q \\) can be either 3 or -3.\n   - Let\u2019s consider \\( q = 3 \\). Then, check later if \\( q = -3 \\) works out differently.\n\n4. **Calculate \\( p \\) Using the Middle Term**:\n   - From \\( 2pq = 12 \\), substitute \\( q = 3 \\) gives: \n     \\[\n     2p \\cdot 3 = 12 \\implies 6p = 12 \\implies p = 2\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find \\( a \\) Using \\( p \\)**:\n   - From \\( ax^2 = p^2x^2 \\), substitute \\( p = 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     a = p^2 = 2^2 \\implies a = 4\n     \\]\n\n6. **Verification and Reflection**:\n   - Now, let's substitute back and check if it works out:\n     - Expression of perfect square: \\( (2x + 3)^2 = 4x^2 + 12x + 9 \\).\n     - Matches our quadratic form: \\( 4x^2 + 12x + 9 \\).\n   - It checks out! So the quadratic expression is correctly identified as a perfect square for this \\( a \\).\n\n### Exploring Alternate \\( q \\) Values\n\n7. **Check \\( q = -3 \\)**:\n   - If \\( q = -3 \\), the calculation changes to:\n   - \\( 2p(-3) = 12 \\implies -6p = 12 \\implies p = -2 \\).\n   - For \\( a \\), using \\( p = -2 \\):\n     \\[\n     a = (-2)^2 = 4\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, even if \\( q = -3 \\), \\( a = 4 \\) remains unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter exploring the different possibilities and confirming through each step, we can be confident that the correct value of \\( a \\) is \\( \\boxed{4} \\). The expression \\( ax^2 + 12x + 9 \\) can indeed be written as \\( (2x+3)^2 \\) or \\( (-2x-3)^2 \\) when \\( a = 4 \\). Each approach led to the same conclusion, verifying the consistency and correctness of the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The square of the binomial $rx+s$ is  \\[(rx+s)^2=r^2x^2+2rsx+s^2.\\]If this is equal to $ax^2+12x+9$, then $s$ must be either 3 or $-3$.  Since $(rx+s)^2=(-rx-s)^2$, we may choose either $s=3$ or $s=-3$, and the solution will be the same.  We choose $s=3$.\n\nThe square of $rx+3$ is  \\[(rx+3)^2=r^2x^2+6rx+9.\\]If this is equal to $ax^2+12x+9$ then we must have $12=6r$ or $r=2$.  This gives our square: \\[\\left(2x+3\\right)^2=4x^2+12x+9.\\]Therefore $a=\\boxed{4}$."
