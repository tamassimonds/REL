    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into solving the equation \\(\\sqrt[3]{3 - x} = -\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nFirst impressions: This looks like a relatively straightforward problem involving cube roots. We want to find \\(x\\) such that when we substitute it into \\(\\sqrt[3]{3 - x}\\), the output is \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nThe equation involves a cube root, which suggests that the solution will involve cubing both sides to eliminate the radical. However, let's pause and consider a few potential strategies:\n\n- **Strategy 1: Algebraic Manipulation**: Immediately address the cube root by cubing both sides.\n- **Strategy 2: Numerical Estimation**: Consider estimating potential values for \\(x\\) using intuition, then refine if needed.\n- **Strategy 3: Graphical Method**: Graph \\(\\sqrt[3]{3 - x}\\) and see where it intersects with \\(y = -\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nThe simplest approach seems to be the algebraic manipulation, so let's start there.\n\n**Step 2: Algebraic Manipulation**\n\nLet's work through the algebraic manipulation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{3 - x} = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nCubing both sides will remove the cube root:\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt[3]{3 - x})^3 = \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n\\[\n3 - x = -\\frac{27}{8}\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(x\\) by isolating it:\n\n\\[\n3 - x = -\\frac{27}{8}\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\(3\\) from both sides. But pause! Recall that \\(3\\) can be written as \\(\\frac{24}{8}\\) to handle the fractions effectively:\n\n\\[\n3 = \\frac{24}{8}\n\\]\n\nSubtract:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{8} - x = -\\frac{27}{8}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), add \\(x\\) to both sides and also move \\(\\frac{27}{8}\\) to the other side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{8} + \\frac{27}{8} = x\n\\]\n\nCombining the fractions:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{24 + 27}{8} = \\frac{51}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Verification**\n\nLet\u2019s verify by substituting back into the original equation:\n\nSubstitute \\(x = \\frac{51}{8}\\) into the original cube root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{3 - \\frac{51}{8}}\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\(3\\) as \\(\\frac{24}{8}\\) again for consistency in subtracting fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{24}{8} - \\frac{51}{8}} = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{27}{8}}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{27}{8}} = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nYes, it checks out perfectly with the right side. Our solution \\(x = \\frac{51}{8}\\) is indeed correct.\n\n**Step 4: Final Thoughts & Reflection**\n\nReflecting on the method, using algebra to manage the cube root was efficient. Graphically or numerically checking was not necessary, but it could serve as a backup strategy for verification. The algebra demonstrates sound logic, and often keeping fractions clean by balancing them like here is key.\n\nThis solution approach seems solid\u2014good to remember this flow for future similar problems!",
