    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: adding \\(4_6\\) and \\(14_6\\) and expressing the answer in base 6. I'm dealing with numbers in base 6, which aren't quite as familiar as base 10, so I'll need to be careful with how I carry any remainders.\n\n**First Thoughts:** \nWhen I initially look at this problem, it reminds me of adding numbers in base 10, but I need to adjust for the fact that each digit can only go up to 5 in base 6. If I ever get digits beyond 5, I'll need to 'carry over' to the next place value. Let's see how this might work with an example... Actually, I think I'll start solving this problem by writing out the digits vertically like I would with regular addition.\n\n**Step 1: Setup the Problem Vertically**\n```\n  14_6\n+  4_6\n```\nHmm, that seems straightforward. I just need to remember they must stay within base 6 constraints.\n\n**Step 2: Adding the Rightmost Digits**\n- I'm adding \\(4\\) and \\(4\\) in base 6. In base 10, that would normally be \\(8\\).\n\nWait, that can't be right because I've gone up to 8, which is not possible in base 6! I need to convert this back into a valid base 6 number.\n\n**Step 3: Re-check and Adjust** \n- When adding \\(4 + 4\\), that gives me \\(8_{10}\\).\n- Convert \\(8\\) to base 6: \n  - \\(8_{10}\\) divided by \\(6\\) gives a quotient of \\(1\\) and remainder of \\(2\\) so:\n  - \\(8_{10} = 12_6\\)\n\nThis reminds me of how carrying over works. Oh! I should place the \\(2\\) in the units place and carry over the \\(1\\).\n\n**Step 4: Add the Digits Including Carry-Over**\n- What's left now is to add the remaining number in the tens place: \\(1\\) from \\(14_6\\).\n\n```\n   1_6 (carry)\n  14_6\n+  4_6\n_____\n  22_6\n```\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nAfter thinking this through again, each step seems consistent with what happens in base 10 addition but within base 6 constraints. This is the intriguing part since no digit in base 6 should exceed 5.\n\nMy final answer appears to be \\(22_6\\). I should recalculate that last part just to verify if I've maintained the integrity of base 6:\n\n- The carried over \\(1\\) plus \\(1\\) (from \\(14_6\\)) totals to \\(2\\).\n- And a result of \\(2\\) in the place that accommodates \\(6^1\\) is fine, as it respects base 6 rules.\n\n**Final Check:** \nDoes \\(22_6\\) make sense? Well, quickly converting \\(22_6\\) back to base 10 for a sanity check:\n- \\(2 \\times 6 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14_{10}\\).\nAh, it checks out since \\(4_{10} + 10_{10} = 14_{10}\\).\n\nI'm confident that the process and conversions were successfully carried out. The final answer in base 6 is \\(22_6\\).",

  "ground_truth": "When adding the numbers, we notice that $4+4$ leaves a residue of $2$ when divided by $6.$ Thus, the sum will have a rightmost digit of $2,$ and we must carry-over. This yields that $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\stackrel{1}{} & \\stackrel{}{4}_6 \\\\ &+ & & 1 & 4_6 \\\\ \\cline{2-5} && & 2 & 2_6 \\\\ \\end{array}$$ The sum is therefore $\\boxed{22_6}.$"
