  "problem": "In Chemistry class, Samantha finds that she can make a certain solution by mixing $.04$ liters of chemical A with $.02$ liters of water (this gives her $.06$ liters of the solution). She wants to make a total of $.48$ liters of this new solution.  To do so, how many liters of water will she use?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's start by diving into the problem. We need to understand exactly what's being asked and what information we have. \n\nFirst thoughts:\n- Samantha has a recipe for a solution: 0.04 liters of chemical A with 0.02 liters of water gives a total of 0.06 liters of the solution. \n- The task is to make 0.48 liters of the same solution. \n- We need to calculate how much water Samantha will use in total. \n\nHmm, initially, this feels like a straightforward scaling problem because we're increasing the amount of solution from 0.06 liters to 0.48 liters, which is 8 times more solution. \n\nStep 1: Understand the current composition\n- Current solution contains 0.04 liters of chemical A and 0.02 liters of water.\n- Total current solution = 0.06 liters.\n- Checking proportions: Chemical A makes up 0.04 / 0.06 = 2/3 of the solution. Water makes up 0.02 / 0.06 = 1/3 of the solution.\n\nThis setup seems right since 2/3 + 1/3 = 1, which accounts for the whole solution.\n\nStep 2: Scaling up the composition\n- If we want to make 0.48 liters, we need to multiply the amount of each component by 0.48 / 0.06 to maintain the same proportions.\n- 0.48 / 0.06 = 8, which confirms we need to multiply each component by 8.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the amount of water needed\n- Current water content = 0.02 liters.\n- Total water needed = 0.02 liters * 8 = 0.16 liters.\n\nQuick mental check: \n- Original solution is multiplied by 8 to obtain the desired volume. If 0.02 liters of water is multiplied by 8, it seems reasonable that 0.16 liters will be the correct value, as it's directly proportional.\n\nTo ensure correctness:\n- Original solution is 0.06 liters. Expanded solution should be 0.48 liters.\n- With the scaling factor of 8, both the chemical A and water components should fit this scaling requirement, and they match our derived amounts.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n- I feel confident in this approach because it properly maintains the proportions of the original solution while scaling up to the required total amount.\n- Answer: Samantha will use 0.16 liters of water to make 0.48 liters of the solution. \n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration makes sense! Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to discuss.",

  "ground_truth": "Firstly, we find that $\\frac{.02}{.06}=\\frac{1}{3}$ is the fraction of water in the solution.  Thus, since Samantha wants $.48$ total liters of the solution, we have that she must use $.48 \\times \\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{0.16}$ liters of water."
