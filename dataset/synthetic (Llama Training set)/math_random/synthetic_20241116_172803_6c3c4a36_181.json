    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem systematically. My first impression is that dealing with arithmetic means involves understanding the sum of the numbers and how changes to the list affect this sum. Fractions and divisions are likely to play a role, which often requires careful handling of calculations.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- We have nine numbers with a mean of 54. This can be related to the sum of these numbers since the mean is the sum divided by the number of elements.\n- By adding two numbers, \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), the mean of the list of eleven numbers becomes 66. This indicates a new sum.\n- The question asks for the mean of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\). This suggests that their combined effect on the two means is key.\n\nOkay, let's outline my potential approaches:\n\n1. **Sum Approach:** Calculate the initial sum based on the first mean and adjust it with the change in mean to include \\( u \\) and \\( v \\).\n2. **Equation Setup:** Set up algebraic equations using the information given about the means.\n\nPerhaps the Sum Approach will clarify things first:\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Calculate the initial sum of the nine numbers:**\n\n   - Since the mean of these numbers is 54 and there are nine numbers, the total sum of these nine numbers can be given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Sum of nine numbers} = 54 \\times 9 = 486\n     \\]\n   - I feel confident about this step because it\u2019s a straightforward calculation derived from the parameter the problem provides.\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of the eleven numbers:**\n\n   - The mean of the eleven numbers becomes 66. Therefore, the sum of these eleven numbers will be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Sum of eleven numbers} = 66 \\times 11 = 726\n     \\]\n   - This makes sense; as more numbers are added with a higher mean, the total sum should increase.\n\n3. **Determine the sum of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\):**\n\n   - To find the sum of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), we need to consider how the initial sum (486) changes to the new sum (726):\n     \\[\n     u + v = 726 - 486 = 240\n     \\]\n   - This calculation tells us that the total of these two new numbers must add up to 240.\n\n4. **Find the mean of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\):**\n\n   - The mean is simply the total sum of the items divided by their count. Since we want the mean of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Mean of } u \\text{ and } v = \\frac{u + v}{2} = \\frac{240}{2} = 120\n     \\]\n\n**Reflecting and Checking:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yeah, the new numbers add enough to raise the mean significantly from 54 to 66. The given values check out using basic mean properties.\n- **Any errors noticed?** None evident. It seems the calculations were straightforward and the logic holds up.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mean of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) is 120. Every step seems consistent with the problem requirements, and calculations align with the arithmetic principles. I feel confident in this solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The original nine numbers, with mean 54, must have a sum of $9 \\cdot 54 = 486$. After including $u$ and $v$, we have eleven numbers now, and their sum must be $11 \\cdot 66 = 726$. Since the only new numbers in this sum are $u$ and $v$, $u+ v = 726 - 486 = 240$. So, the mean of $u$ and $v$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(u+v) = \\frac{1}{2}(240) = \\boxed{120}$."
