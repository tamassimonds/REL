    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. I'll try to capture my thoughts as naturally as I can, as if I'm tackling this problem right now.\n\n### Understanding the problem:\nThe question states that the sum of the first 20 positive even integers is equal to the sum of four consecutive even integers. We're tasked with finding the largest of these four integers.\n\nSo, I need to:\n1. Calculate the sum of the first 20 even integers.\n2. Set up an expression for the sum of four consecutive even integers.\n3. Solve the equation to find these integers and, specifically, the largest one.\n\n### Brainstorming:\n- The first 20 even integers are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 40. \n- I remember the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \\( S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of terms, \\( a \\) is the first term, and \\( l \\) is the last term.\n\nThis looks like a straightforward approach. If there's any hiccup, it might be with the algebraic manipulation, but we'll see as we go.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even integers\n- **Applying the formula**: The numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \\( a = 2 \\), the number of terms \\( n = 20 \\), and the last term \\( l = 40 \\).\n- **Calculation**: \n\n    \\[\n    S_{20} = \\frac{20}{2} \\times (2 + 40) = 10 \\times 42 = 420\n    \\]\n\nThis means the sum of the first 20 even numbers is 420. Seems reasonable, let's continue.\n\n### Step 2: Express the sum of four consecutive even integers\n- Let's define these four even integers as \\( x - 2, x, x + 2, x + 4 \\) (since they are consecutive even numbers).\n- Their sum is \\( (x - 2) + x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) \\).\n\n- **Simplifying the expression**: \n\n    \\[\n    (x - 2) + x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 4x + 4\n    \\]\n\n### Step 3: Equate the sums\n- We set the equation \\( 4x + 4 = 420 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\( x \\)\n- **Re-arrange the equation**:\n\n    \\[\n    4x + 4 = 420 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4x = 420 - 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4x = 416\n    \\]\n\n- **Divide by 4**: \n\n    \\[\n    x = \\frac{416}{4} = 104\n    \\]\n\nSo, \\( x = 104 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Identify the largest integer\n- The integers are \\( x - 2, x, x + 2, x + 4 \\), which are 102, 104, 106, and 108.\n- The largest of these numbers is **108**.\n\n### Final Check\n- Let's verify: Checking \\( 102 + 104 + 106 + 108 \\).\n\n    \\[\n    102 + 104 = 206; \\quad 106 + 108 = 214; \\quad 206 + 214 = 420\n    \\]\n\nIt adds up correctly to 420, which matches our calculation of the first 20 even numbers.\n\nEverything checks out! The largest of the four consecutive even integers whose sum is the same as the sum of the first 20 positive even integers is **108**. This seems like a good end point for the problem, everything seems consistent with what was asked and calculated.",

  "ground_truth": "The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2 + 4 + \\dots + 40 = 2 (1 + 2 + \\dots + 20)$.  For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \\dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $2 (1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) = 20 \\cdot 21 = 420$.\n\nLet the four consecutive even integers be $n - 6$, $n - 4$, $n - 2$, and $n$.  Their sum is $4n - 12 = 420$, so $n = \\boxed{108}$."
