    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. My first thought is that this expression looks like it is dealing with some kind of infinite nested logarithms. The structure \\(\\log_2 (27 + \\log_2 (27 + \\log_2 (27 + \\cdots)))\\) suggests a recursive or self-referential nature. This is reminding me of a type of expression where each layer is embedded into the next, which might eventually converge on a single value. \n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe need to find the value of this infinite nested expression involving base 2 logarithms. Given expressions like this often simplify by assuming convergence, let's assume it converges to some value \\( x \\). Thus, we can write this as:\n\\[ x = \\log_2 (27 + x). \\]\n\n### Step 2: Reformulate the Problem\nLet's try expressing this relationship. Since we're dealing with logarithms:\n\\[\nx = \\log_2 (27 + x) \\implies 2^x = 27 + x.\n\\]\nSo, the problem boils down to solving the equation \\( 2^x = 27 + x \\).\n\n### Step 3: Explore Possible Strategies\nOne way to tackle this equation is to explore some values for \\( x \\) to see where they might align. This is neither a polynomial nor a straightforward linear equation, so exploring values might help:\n- Try \\( x = 4 \\): then \\( 2^4 = 16 \\neq 27 + 4 \\).\n- Try \\( x = 5 \\): then \\( 2^5 = 32 = 27 + 5 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Verification\nLet's verify \\( x = 5 \\):\n- Substitute back into the expression: \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and indeed \\( 32 = 27 + 5 \\).\n  \n### Step 5: Analyze and Reflect\nIt seems like my trial and error led to a solution that checks out; \\( x = 5 \\) is indeed the solution that satisfies the equation \\( 2^x = 27 + x \\). This approach of setting the nested expression equal to a variable and solving worked for this problem. \n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\nNow that we've confirmed the relationship holds, we can confidently conclude:\n\\[ \\log_2 (27 + \\log_2 (27 + \\log_2 (27 + \\cdots))) = 5. \\]\n\n### Check for Consistency\nLet's reflect if this makes sense. The equation \\( 2^x = 27 + x \\) has a plausible solution where exponential growth and linear offset intersect at a reasonably small number given logarithmic behavior. Everything seems consistent with the expectations for nested logarithmic functions.\n\nIn conclusion, through verification and logical deductions, the value of the expression is indeed \\( x = 5 \\). I'm confident this approach led to the correct solution.",
