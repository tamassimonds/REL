    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by going through a brainstorming session. \n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- At first glance, I'm tasked with finding the positive factors of 96 that are also multiples of 12. This is clearly about understanding factors better, and factors of a number like 96 break down into simpler, smaller numbers.\n  \n- This reminds me of when I had to break down numbers into their prime factors for other problems \u2014 I remember it can really help to simplify initially complex-looking problems by breaking them into their component parts.\n\n---\n\n**Starting Point:**\n\n1. I'm aware that to find factors of 96, I should consider its prime factorization because that will help me see all the combinations that make 96.\n\n2. Simultaneously, I should remember that if a number is a multiple of 12, its factorization must include at least the prime factors of 12 (most probably 2 and 3 in some multiplicity). I seem to remember 12 breaks down into \\(2^2\\) and \\(3^1\\).\n\n3. Do I remember prime factorization well enough to start? Let's see:\n\n   - \\(96 = 2^5 \\times 3^1\\). Yup! I found this by slowing dividing 96 by 2, then checking.\n   \n---\n\n**Understanding the Requirements:**\n\n4. Since I need factors of 96 that are multiple of 12, it means I need to see how combinations of \\(2^5 \\times 3^1\\) can include \\(2^2 \\times 3^1\\) \u2014 interesting! It looks like I just need all factors of 96 greater than or equal to 12 from my prime representation. \n\n5. How do I test that? I need to explore how many factor combinations include the 12. This includes finding combinations like \\(2^x \\times 3^y\\) where \\(x \\geq 2\\) and \\(y \\geq 1\\).\n\n---\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n6. Let's list the factors of 96:\n   \n   - Basic combinations would be \\( (2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5) \\times (3^0, 3^1)\\).\n  \n7. For each combination, let's explore:\n\n   - \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 = 12\\) which is indeed 12,\n   - \\(2^3 \\times 3^1 = 24\\),\n   - \\(2^4 \\times 3^1 = 48\\),\n   - \\(2^5 \\times 3^1 = 96\\).\n\n8. All of these combinations have \\(x \\geq 2\\) and \\(y \\geq 1\\).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n9. I can see that the positive factors of 96 that also include 12 as factors are: 12, 24, 48, and 96.\n\n10. Let's count: I determined these factors: (12, 24, 48, 96). That's four numbers.\n\n11. Does this match my earlier logical understanding step based on \\(y \\geq 1\\) and \\(x \\geq 2\\)? Yes, it checks out correctly!\n\n---\n\n**Verification:**\n\n12. Let's verify by multiplication and listing factors: Seeing these numbers, I can confirm 12 is present in each (strictly through combinations).\n13. Reflecting on if I missed any logical step regarding \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) conditions: Nope, I did logically expose needed restrictions, it looks consistent.\n\n14. So indeed, there are **four** positive factors of 96 that are multiples of 12.\n\n---\n\nThis whole unpacking process can help recognize if you approached each step logically and covered all the different combos. What a neat way to conclude this!",

  "ground_truth": "We first list the factors of 96 to see which are multiples of 12. The factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96. We see which factors are divisible by 12, because if they are divisible by 12 then they are multiples of 12. We can check them each: 1 is not, 2 is not, 3 is not, 4 is not, 6 is not, 8 is not, 12 is, 16 is not, 24 is, 32 is not, 48 is, and 96 is. So there are $\\boxed{4}$ factors of 96 that are multiples of 12."
