    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem:\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nHmm, this looks like a complex fraction problem where we have a fraction divided by another fraction. I remember doing something like this before, where it's all about simplifying each part step by step. My instinct tells me to first deal with the numerators and denominators individually before attempting the division.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategy:**\n\n1. **Numerator:** Simplify \\(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n2. **Denominator:** Simplify \\(\\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n3. Combine these results using \\(\\frac{A}{B}\\) structure.\n4. Simplify the resulting fraction to its simplest form.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Numerator (\\(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}\\))**\n\nTo add these fractions, they need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\n- Convert \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 12:  \n  \\(\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{12}\\).\n- Convert \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 12:  \n  \\(\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{12}\\).\n\nNow add the fractions:  \n\\(\\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{7}{12}\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Denominator (\\(\\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{1}{6}\\))**\n\nAgain, find a common denominator for subtraction. The least common multiple of 5 and 6 is 30.\n\n- Convert \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 30:  \n  \\(\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{12}{30}\\).\n- Convert \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 30:  \n  \\(\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{30}\\).\n\nSubtract the fractions:  \n\\(\\frac{12}{30} - \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{7}{30}\\).\n\n**Step 3: Divide the Results**\n\nRecall the rule for dividing fractions: \\(\\frac{A}{B} = A \\times \\frac{1}{B}\\).\n\nSo, we need to compute:  \n\\(\\frac{\\frac{7}{12}}{\\frac{7}{30}} = \\frac{7}{12} \\times \\frac{30}{7}\\).\n\n**Before multiplication, check for simplification:**\n\n- Both 7s in the numerator and denominator cancel out.\n- We are left with \\(\\frac{30}{12}\\).\n\n**Step 4: Simplify \\(\\frac{30}{12}\\)**\n\n- Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 30 and 12, which is 6.\n- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 6:  \n  \\(\\frac{30 \\div 6}{12 \\div 6} = \\frac{5}{2}\\).\n\nThat felt a bit too straightforward, but let me double-check:\n\n- The addition and subtraction of fractions were done with the correct common denominators.\n- The division of the resulting fractions followed the correct process.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe calculations at each step seem consistent with the fundamental arithmetic rules. The final simplified fraction is valid.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe answer is \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\). The solution feels right: calculated, verified, and simplified properly.",

  "ground_truth": "Let's look at the numerator of the big fraction first. To add $\\frac{1}{3}$ to $\\frac{1}{4}$, we must first find a common denominator. In this case, it's $12$. So \\[\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1\\cdot4}{3\\cdot4} + \\frac{1\\cdot3}{4\\cdot3} = \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{4+3}{12} = \\frac{7}{12}.\\]Similarly, looking at the denominator of the big fraction, we must again find a common denominator. In this case, it's $30$. So we have \\[\\frac{2}{5}-\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{12}{30} - \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{7}{30}.\\]Now, the remainder of the problem is to find $\\frac{~\\frac{7}{12}~}{\\frac{7}{30}}$. Remembering that dividing is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, we get \\[\\frac{~\\frac{7}{12}~}{\\frac{7}{30}} = \\frac{7}{12} \\times \\frac{30}{7} = \\frac{30}{12}.\\]But $\\frac{30}{12}$ can be written as $\\frac{6\\cdot5}{6\\cdot2}$, so our answer simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$."
