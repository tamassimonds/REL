She spies a group of ten high schoolers and starts playing a game by herself, in which she looks at a pair of people from the group of ten and tries to guess whether they like or dislike each other. How many pairs of friends can she observe before she runs out of pairs to evaluate?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem where Fiona is observing pairs of high schoolers. First, let's understand the objective:\n\n**Objective:** Determine the number of unique pairs Fiona can observe in a group of ten high schoolers.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nThis reminds me of combinatorics, specifically the part about choosing pairs from a group. I have a vague recollection that this involves combinations since the order of the pair doesn't matter, just the pairing itself. \n\n**Possible Strategy Approaches:**\n\n- **List Out the Pairs:** I could try listing out pairs manually, but with ten people, this would be tedious and prone to errors.\n- **Visualize:** Imagine the group, even draw them out with lines connecting pairs, but again, this might become cumbersome with more than a few people.\n- **Combinatorial Formulae:** Use the combinations formula, which seems the most efficient method since it directly addresses how to compute pairs.\n  \n**Let's Evaluate Each Approach:**\n\n1. **Listing Out the Pairs:**\n   - High chance of errors since keeping track manually of all pairs is hard.\n   - Quickly seems infeasible as just listing pairs for three or four people is already complex.\n   - Abandoning this method as it\u2019s inefficient.\n\n2. **Visualization:**\n   - Drawing people as points, lines as connections, quickly gets cluttered.\n   - Useful for smaller groups but not practical for ten people without mistakes.\n   - Dismissing this as well since it's visually complex.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Formula:**\n   - Ah! The formula for combinations could work here: \\( \\binom{n}{r} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number (10 high schoolers), and \\( r \\) is the number to choose (2 for a pair).\n   - Seems promising since it provides a straightforward calculation.\n\n**Let's Calculate Using Combinatorial Formula:**\n\nNow, let me recall the combinations formula:\n\\[ \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\]\nHere, \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( r = 2 \\), so:\n\\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** 45 seems like a reasonable number because with each additional person, the number of pairs increases significantly.\n  \n- **Recount Thought Process:**\n  - Using 10 high schoolers makes sense to pair them up, as there are multiple non-repeating combinations.\n  - Confirmed, no duplication since order doesn\u2019t matter in pairs.\n\n**Outcome:** \n\nFiona can observe 45 different pairs of friendships (or dislikes) without repeating any pairs.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- No missing pairs since using combinations inherently covers all unique pair selections.\n- The formula and logic feel sound. \n\nNo other simpler strategies seemed plausible that are as precise and straightforward as the combinatorial approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI'll solidly conclude that Fiona would have 45 unique pairs of high schoolers to observe before she runs out of new pairs. Each method and step reaffirms the correctness of this approach.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $10$ options for the first person and $9$ options left for the second person for a preliminary count of $10 \\cdot 9 = 90$ pairs. However, the order in which Fiona chooses the people doesn't matter, and we've counted each pair twice, which means our final answer is $\\dfrac{10\\cdot9}{2}=\\boxed{45}$ pairs of friends."
