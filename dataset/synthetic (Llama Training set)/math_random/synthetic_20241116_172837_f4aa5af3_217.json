    "working_out": "Alright, here we go with the division problem: \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nThis is a polynomial division problem where we need to divide \\(3z^4 - 4z^3 + 5z^2 - 11z + 2\\) by \\(2 + 3z\\). My first thought is that this looks similar to the polynomial division problems I've tackled before, perhaps a lot like synthetic or long division. The challenge is breaking down the polynomial with respect to the divisor. \n\nBut wait\u2014I notice the divisor is written in the form \\(2 + 3z\\), rather than the usual \\(3z + 2\\). So first I'm going to rewrite it as \\(3z + 2\\) for simplicity, which doesn\u2019t change its value but makes it easier to compare with the dividend terms.\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\n\nMaybe I could use polynomial long division. That's often reliable for polynomials, but usually a bit tedious. An alternative might be synthetic division. However, synthetic division primarily deals with divisors of the form \\(z - c\\), so it might not straightforwardly apply here. Let's start with long division.\n\n**Set Up Polynomial Long Division:**\n\nThe process of polynomial long division is similar to numerical long division. I'll write down \\(3z^4 - 4z^3 + 5z^2 - 11z + 2\\) inside the division symbol (the dividend) and \\(3z + 2\\) outside (the divisor). Then:\n\n1. **First Term Division:**\n   - Divide the leading term \\(3z^4\\) by the leading term of the divisor \\(3z\\), which gives \\(z^3\\).\n   - I multiply \\(3z + 2\\) by \\(z^3\\), resulting in \\(3z^4 + 2z^3\\).\n\n2. **Subtract:**\n   - Subtract \\(3z^4 + 2z^3\\) from \\(3z^4 - 4z^3\\), resulting in \\(-6z^3\\) (as the leading term) and we still have the rest unchanged making it \\(-6z^3 + 5z^2 - 11z + 2\\).\n\n3. **Second Term Division:**\n   - Next, divide \\(-6z^3\\) by \\(3z\\), resulting in \\(-2z^2\\).\n   - Multiply \\(3z + 2\\) by \\(-2z^2\\), giving \\(-6z^3 - 4z^2\\).\n\n4. **Subtract:**\n   - Subtract \\(-6z^3 - 4z^2\\) from \\(-6z^3 + 5z^2\\) resulting in \\(9z^2\\) and the expression now reads as \\(9z^2 - 11z + 2\\).\n\n5. **Third Term Division:**\n   - Divide \\(9z^2\\) by \\(3z\\), resulting in \\(3z\\).\n   - Multiply \\(3z + 2\\) by \\(3z\\), to get \\(9z^2 + 6z\\).\n\n6. **Subtract:**\n   - Subtract \\(9z^2 + 6z\\) from \\(9z^2 - 11z\\), giving \\(-17z\\) and the expression now reads \\(-17z + 2\\).\n\n7. **Fourth Term Division:**\n   - Divide \\(-17z\\) by \\(3z\\), giving \\(-\\frac{17}{3}\\).\n   - Multiply \\(3z + 2\\) by \\(-\\frac{17}{3}\\), which results in \\(-17z - \\frac{34}{3}\\).\n\n8. **Subtract:**\n   - Now, subtract \\(-17z - \\frac{34}{3}\\) from \\(-17z + 2\\), resulting in \\(\\frac{40}{3}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, I see that my remainder is \\(\\frac{40}{3}\\). The quotient I've obtained is \\(z^3 - 2z^2 + 3z - \\frac{17}{3}\\) with a remainder of \\(\\frac{40}{3}\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe quotient for dividing \\(3z^4 - 4z^3 + 5z^2 - 11z + 2\\) by \\(2 + 3z\\) is \\(z^3 - 2z^2 + 3z - \\frac{17}{3}\\) and a remainder \\(\\frac{40}{3}\\). This matches up with what I expect from polynomial long division, so I feel confident about my solution. \n\nBut just for peace of mind, let's quickly reflect on the nature of this quotient. It makes sense in terms of degree: the original polynomial was degree 4, the divisor was degree 1, so the quotient should be degree \\(4-1 = 3\\), which it is. Everything seems to check out!\n\nIf needed, multiplying the quotient and dividing it back by the divisor should return the original polynomial, plus the remainder\u2014perhaps another excellent check if doubts arise!",
