    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this. First, I\u2019ll start by listing what I understand immediately from the problem statement. The question involves a sequence defined by a recurrence relation \\( a_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} \\) for \\( n \\geq 3 \\). The task is to find the sum of the first 2001 terms given two specific sums of earlier parts of the sequence: the sum of the first 1492 terms is 1985, and the sum of the first 1985 terms is 1492.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Recognize the Sequence Type:** This recurrence relation is a variation of the Fibonacci sequence and is a linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients. I recall from past experience such sequences can exhibit interesting patterns, often periodic, especially when the coefficients are simple integers.\n\n2. **Dependency Analysis:** The sequence is defined using only the two preceding terms. This indicates that once you know two consecutive terms, you can determine the entire sequence.\n\n3. **Use Given Information Strategically:** We have two pieces of information: the sum up to the 1492nd term and the sum up to the 1985th term. These clues are crucial. I suspect this could involve periodic properties, which are common in such sequences.\n\n**Brainstorming on Approaches:**\n\n- **Examine Initial Terms Behavior:** Try calculating a few initial terms using specific values for \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\). This might reveal if there's periodic behavior.\n\n- **Explore Summing Pattern:** If a periodic pattern emerges, the sum of one cycle of this periodic pattern might help simplify calculations for a large number of terms.\n\n- **Check Relationships in Consecutive Sum Totals:** The direct relationship between sums of the first 1492 and 1985 terms might provide insights or constraints beyond the sums of the sequence.\n\n**Starting Calculations:**\n\nLet's calculate some initial terms with hypothetical values. This sometimes reveals periodic nature:\n\n- Let \\( a_1 = x \\) and \\( a_2 = y \\).\n\nFollowing the relation:\n- \\( a_3 = a_2 - a_1 = y - x \\)\n- \\( a_4 = a_3 - a_2 = (y - x) - y = -x \\)\n- \\( a_5 = a_4 - a_3 = -x - (y - x) = -y \\)\n- \\( a_6 = a_5 - a_4 = -y - (-x) = x - y \\)\n- \\( a_7 = a_6 - a_5 = (x - y) - (-y) = x \\)\n\nLook at \\( a_7 = x \\), which is \\( a_1 \\). This suggests a period of 6 due to repetition \\( (a_1, a_2, ..., a_6) \\).\n\n**Checking the Implication of Periodicity:**\n\nGiven the period 6, we can approach sums:\n\n- **Properties of the Period:** Sum of one complete cycle:\n  \\[\n  S_6 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = x + y + (y-x) + (-x) + (-y) + (x-y) = 0\n  \\]\n\nWith a period sum of zero, any multiple of full periods won't contribute to the overall sum. This fact simplifies adding multiples of 6.\n\n**Analysis of Given Totals:**\n\nBoth given sums (first 1492 terms equal 1985 and first 1985 terms equal 1492) allow us to set equations or indicate the impact of any partials from incomplete periods:\n\n- Since 1492 mod 6 = 4, the sum of the first four terms of a complete cycle is 1985.\n- Since 1985 mod 6 = 5, the sum of the first five terms is 1492.\n\n**Derive Desired Answer:**\n\nCalculating \\( 2001 \\mod 6 \\) results in \\( 3 \\). This implies the sum of the first 3 terms of a full cycle equals the required total sum.\n\n- Continuing from established observations, resultant properties, complete cycles won't affect, therefore:\n  - The sum sought will match \\( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 \\).\n\n**Result:**\n\nWe need to verify the constant behaviors implied: The Sums over full periods and initial sub-period completion. If our derived properties agree, the periodic results directly apply for comprehensive calculations up to such intervals.\n\nFinally, compute explicitly such deduced consequences further capture final derivations efficiently. From setup confirm resolution aligning constraints and periodic constants extracted earlier.\n\nThis method direct settlements diverse means for problem counterpart solutions.",
