Immediately, what comes to mind is that we should start by checking whether smaller prime numbers divide 1821. This reminds me of basic problem-solving strategies for factors, especially relating to integers.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst, let's comprehend the question: We need the smallest prime number that can divide 1821 with no remainder. Typically, for such problems, we begin by testing small prime numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Strategy Brainstorming\n\nHmm, maybe the best way to check for prime factors is to start with the smallest and go upwards. The smallest prime is 2, followed by 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. \n\n- **Strategy 1:** Check divisibility by small primes.\n- **Strategy 2:** Try to identify if there are any obvious shortcuts using divisibility rules.\n- **Potential Shortcut:** Check if the number is even (ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8), then it's divisible by 2, the smallest prime.\n\n### Step 3: Trying Strategy 1 - Smallest Primes\n\nLet's go through these primes one by one to find if 1821 is divisible by any:\n\n1. **Divisibility by 2:** \n   - 1821 is odd (it ends in 1), so it's not divisible by 2. Quick check.\n   - **Reflection:** Move to the next prime since that was straightforward and unsuccessful.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 3:**\n   - Sum of the digits: \\(1 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 12\\). \n   - \\(12\\) is divisible by 3, so 1821 could be divisible. Let's check:\n   - \\(1821 \\div 3 = 607\\)\n   - 1821 is divisible by 3.\n\n### Step 4: Verification and Reflection\n\n- **Verification:** \n  - Calculation check: \\(607 \\times 3 = 1821\\). Yes, it worked, so 3 is indeed a factor.\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  - At this point, the smallest prime factor is 3.\n  - I feel confident in this, especially since I've confirmed the multiplication check.\n\n### Alternative Reflection\n\n- **Second Check:** Consider if there might be any smaller primes I unknowingly skipped over.\n  - On review, I checked 2 and 3 (the smallest primes), and 2 was not possible. Therefore, 3 should indeed be the smallest.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the smallest prime factor of 1821 is \\(\\boxed{3}\\). With this strategic exploration of a few small steps and double-checking work, we\u2019ve efficiently solved the problem.",

  "ground_truth": "1821 is clearly not even, so 2 is not a factor. We find that 3 is a factor, since the sum of the digits of 1821 is $1 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 12$, which is divisible by 3. Since we want the smallest prime factor, we are done; our answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
