    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. The task is to find the area of a right triangle where one leg measures 24 inches, and the hypotenuse is 25 inches. \n\nStep 1: *Reviewing what we know*\nFirst, recalling what I know about right triangles: They follow the Pythagorean theorem, \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse. One of the properties of a right triangle is that one of the angles is 90 degrees (hence 'right triangle'). \n\nGiven:\n- One leg (\\(b\\)) = 24 inches\n- Hypotenuse (\\(c\\)) = 25 inches\n\nI realize instantly, wait, this resembles something familiar. These numbers remind me of the classic 3-4-5 right triangle but scaled up. That means this triangle could be a scaled 3-4-5, but let's confirm.\n\nStep 2: *Check the lesser-known leg using the Pythagorean theorem*\nI have \\(c = 25\\) and \\(b = 24\\), so:\n\\[ a^2 + 24^2 = 25^2 \\]\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ a^2 + 576 = 625 \\]\n\nHmm, okay. Let's isolate \\(a^2\\):\n\\[ a^2 = 625 - 576 \\]\n\\[ a^2 = 49 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\\[ a = 7 \\]\n\nNice! \\(a = 7\\). So, the other leg of the triangle is 7 inches. That confirms what I hoped - the 7-24-25 triangle.\n\nStep 3: *Calculate the area*\nThe formula for the area of a right triangle is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nIn this context, we can take the two legs of the triangle as the base and height. So:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 7 \\times 24 \\]\n\nStep 4: *Compute the area*\nQuick multiplication:\n\\[ 7 \\times 24 = 168 \\]\nThen:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 168 \\]\n\nDividing 168 by 2:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 84 \\]\n\nSo the area of the triangle is 84 square inches.\n\nStep 5: *Reflection and verification*\nHmm, let me pause and recheck. Looks good, but always good to double-check. When carrying out 7 x 24, I used the breakdown: \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\) and \\(7 \\times 20 = 140\\). Combine them for 168. Yep, accurate. Dividing by 2 leads firmly to 84.\n\nThe dimensions match a known right triangle type (7-24-25), and the area calculation seems consistent. Yes, I'm confident this is correct given all checks.\n\nConclusion: The area of the right triangle is indeed 84 square inches.",

  "ground_truth": "The other leg is $\\sqrt{25^2-24^2}=\\sqrt{625-576}=\\sqrt{49}=7$. The area is $\\frac12\\cdot24\\cdot7=12\\cdot7=\\boxed{84}$ square inches."
