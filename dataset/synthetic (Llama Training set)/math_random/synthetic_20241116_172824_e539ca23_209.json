Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?",

    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n- Okay, I've got a problem with a container and some ice cubes. The first thing that catches my attention here is that we're dealing with volumes since we're talking about a container and cubes. I'm immediately thinking about how to calculate the volume of a cube.\n\n- The cube-shaped container is straightforward because it's mentioned to be a perfect cube measuring 10 inches on each side. So I know how to compute the volume of a cube: \\( \\text{Volume} = \\text{side}^3 \\).\n\n- It says the container is filled until it's half full. This seems important because I need to account for how much water is there before the ice cubes go in. \n\n- Then we throw ice cubes in. Each measures 2 inches on each side. I'll need to calculate their total volume, including how many we're putting in. \n\nPlan:\n1. Calculate the volume of the container.\n2. Determine the volume occupied by the water when the container is half full.\n3. Calculate the total volume of the ten ice cubes.\n4. Determine the combined volume of water and ice.\n5. Subtract the combined volume of water and ice from the total container volume to find how much of the container is unoccupied.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the volume of the container.\n- Volume of the container \\( = 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 1000 \\) cubic inches.\n  - Quick check: \\( 10^3 \\) indeed equals 1000; that seems right.\n\nStep 2: Determine the volume occupied by the water.\n- Since it's half full, the water occupies \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 = 500 \\) cubic inches.\n  - Quick check: Half of 1000 is 500; that looks good.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the volume of all the ice cubes.\n- Volume of one ice cube \\( = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8 \\) cubic inches.\n- Total volume of 10 ice cubes \\( = 10 \\times 8 = 80 \\) cubic inches.\n  - Quick check: 10 cubes at 8 cubic inches each is 80; that makes sense to me.\n\nStep 4: Determine the combined volume of water and ice.\n- Combined volume \\( = 500 \\) (water) \\( + 80 \\) (ice) \\( = 580 \\) cubic inches.\n  - Quick check: \\( 500 + 80 = 580 \\); this seems correct.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the unoccupied volume in the container.\n- Unoccupied volume \\( = 1000 \\) (total container volume) \\( - 580 \\) (combined volume) \\( = 420 \\) cubic inches.\n  - Quick check: \\( 1000 - 580 = 420 \\); that looks right to me.\n\nReflection:\n- The math checks out throughout my calculations.\n- I've followed a logical progression from understanding what I need to do, to calculating each component, and finally combining it all to get the answer.\n- I initially thought about what the question wanted me to find, computed the relevant volumes, and subtracted them appropriately.\n\nFinal Answer: 420 cubic inches of the container are unoccupied by ice or water.",

  "ground_truth": "First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice."
