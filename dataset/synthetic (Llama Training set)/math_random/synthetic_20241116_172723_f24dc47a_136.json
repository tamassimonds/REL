    "working_out": "Sure, let's dive into the problem step by step, reflecting on thoughts and strategies as we go along.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first glance at this problem, it looks similar to problems about sums and products of angles or trigonometric identities. Specifically, it involves a sum of logarithms, which makes me think of properties of logarithms and possibly a way to simplify the expression using those properties. The angle terms going from 1\u00b0 to 89\u00b0 also catch my attention, reminding me of complementary angles in trigonometry since complementary angles could simplify calculations involving tangent functions.\n\n---\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem involves evaluating the sum:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(\\tan 1^{\\circ}) + \\log_{10}(\\tan 2^{\\circ}) + \\ldots + \\log_{10}(\\tan 89^{\\circ}).\n\\]\n\nOne immediate thought is the sum of logs can be rewritten using the property of logarithms:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(x) + \\log_{10}(y) = \\log_{10}(xy).\n\\]\n\nUsing this property, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(\\tan 1^{\\circ} \\times \\tan 2^{\\circ} \\times \\cdots \\times \\tan 89^{\\circ}).\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Strategy and Exploration:**\n\nTo move forward, I need to think about how the tangent function behaves from 1\u00b0 to 89\u00b0. A quick check of properties of the tangent function reveals:\n\n- \\(\\tan(90^\\circ - \\theta) = \\cot(\\theta)\\).\n- For \\(\\theta\\) and \\(90^\\circ - \\theta\\), \\(\\tan \\theta \\cdot \\tan(90^\\circ - \\theta) = 1\\), which means pairs like \\(\\tan 1^\\circ\\) and \\(\\tan 89^\\circ\\) will multiply to 1.\n\n---\n\n**Applying Complementary Angles:**\n\nThis insight suggests grouping angles into such complementary pairs up to \\(\\tan 44^\\circ\\) paired with \\(\\tan 46^\\circ\\), and \\(\\tan 45^\\circ\\) stands alone as \\(\\tan 45^\\circ = 1\\).\n\n---\n\n**Pairing Process:**\n\nLet's consider these pairings more formally:\n\n- \\(\\tan 1^\\circ \\cdot \\tan 89^\\circ = 1\\)\n- \\(\\tan 2^\\circ \\cdot \\tan 88^\\circ = 1\\)\n- ...\n- \\(\\tan 44^\\circ \\cdot \\tan 46^\\circ = 1\\)\n- \\(\\tan 45^\\circ = 1\\)\n\nThere are 44 pairs, each product being 1, and one middle term that is also 1. Thus, the entire product \\(\\tan 1^\\circ \\times \\tan 2^\\circ \\times \\ldots \\times \\tan 89^\\circ = 1\\).\n\n---\n\n**Calculating the Final Result:**\n\nFinally, substituting this result into the logarithmic expression:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(1) = 0.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion and Verification:**\n\nEach step logically follows the properties of trigonometry and logarithms, as verified through properties of complementary angles and pairings. The computation appears accurate given the properties used, resulting in:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(\\tan 1^{\\circ} \\times \\tan 2^{\\circ} \\times \\cdots \\times \\tan 89^{\\circ}) = \\log_{10}(1) = 0. \\]\n\nThis solution feels grounded, utilizing the symmetrical nature of the angles and the properties of tangent and logarithms effectively.",
