    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The question is asking how many different four-student committees can be chosen from a group of six students.\n\n### First Thoughts:\n- **Initial Impression:** This seems related to combinations. I remember combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, and that's the case here for forming a committee.\n- **Past Experience:** I've seen problems like this before in my math classes, especially in probability and combinatorics.\n\n### Brainstorming Approaches:\n- **Approach 1:** Use the combinations formula. I recall a formula where you use factorials to calculate the number of combinations: \\( \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\). Here \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\( r \\) is the number of items to actually choose.\n- **Approach 2:** Since there are only six students, maybe I could list possible combinations manually and ensure I cover all possibilities. But I suspect this might become cumbersome.\n- **Approach 3:** Consider the principle of inclusion-exclusion or other advanced combinatorial methods, but that feels unnecessary here due to the small and straightforward nature of the problem.\n\n### Choosing the Approach:\nI think the first approach\u2014using the combinations formula\u2014is the most straightforward and efficient here. Listing all possibilities seems prone to error and could easily become confusing without a systematic framework, and more advanced combinatorial methods seem overkill.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n- **Step 1: Define \\( n \\) and \\( r \\):** For this problem, \\( n = 6 \\) (students) and \\( r = 4 \\) (students for the committee).\n- **Step 2: Apply the Combination Formula:** \n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \\frac{6!}{4! \\times 2!}\n\\]\n\n- **Step 3: Calculate \\( 6! \\), \\( 4! \\), and \\( 2! \\):**\n  - \\( 6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720 \\)\n  - \\( 4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24 \\)\n  - \\( 2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\)\n\n- **Step 4: Plug into Formula and Solve:** \n\n\\[\n\\frac{720}{24 \\times 2} = \\frac{720}{48} = 15\n\\]\n\n### Checking the Work:\n- **Quick Check:** The calculations seem reasonable. \\( 6! \\) is definitely 720, which is a step I know well since it's a common factorial. Dividing 720 by 48 matches up correctly.\n- **Sense Check:** It seems reasonable; there should indeed be a limited but not enormous number of ways to choose four students from six.\n- **Reflection:** Using the combination formula makes perfect sense here, as it accounts for all possible unordered selections without repeats.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Final Answer:** There are 15 different four-student committees that can be chosen from the group of six students.\n- **Reflection on Method:** The combination formula worked perfectly. It's designed for exactly this kind of problem where order doesn't matter, so I'm confident in the result.\n\nIf I were to approach this problem again, I'd likely go straight for the combination formula again, given its reliability and efficiency in providing the answer with minimal steps.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ ways to choose $k$ objects from a group of $n$ distinct objects, so $\\binom{6}{4}=\\frac{6!}{4!2!}=\\frac{6\\cdot5}{2}=\\boxed{15}$ four-member committees may be formed from a group of six students."
