    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We\u2019re tasked with finding the positive value of \\(x\\) such that \\(x^2 = 729\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nWhen I first look at the equation \\(x^2 = 729\\), the immediate thought that comes to mind is the need to isolate \\(x\\) since it's squared. To do this, I should consider taking the square root of both sides because taking the square root is commonly how we undo squaring an unknown. This actually feels familiar from basic algebra problems I've worked through previously.\n\n### Exploring Different Strategies\n- **Strategy 1: Take the square root**: This is the straightforward approach. If \\(x^2 = 729\\), then taking the square root of both sides should give us \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{729}\\). Since we are given that \\(x\\) is positive, technically, we are only interested in the positive root.\n\n- **Strategy 2: Factorization**: Sometimes, breaking down the number 729 into its prime factors can also help, especially if the square root is tricky. However, I suspect 729 might be a perfect square since it looks like a neat number.\n\n- **Strategy 3: Trial and Error/Memorization**: Often remembering perfect squares from memory or using trial and error for small numbers might provide a quick solution. I recall that \\(27^2\\) is something familiar.\n\n### Implementation of Strategies\n**Strategy 1: Take the Square Root**\n\n1. I\u2019m taking the square root of both sides: \\(x = \\sqrt{729}\\).\n2. Understanding that only the positive root interests us, this simplifies the problem to finding \\(\\sqrt{729}\\).\n\n**Strategy 2: Factorization**\n\n1. Break down 729: Start by dividing by small prime numbers.\n   - 729 is odd, not divisible by 2.\n   - Sum of digits of 729 is 18; thus, it's divisible by 3.\n   - Dividing it gives \\(729 \\div 3 = 243\\).\n   - Continuing: \\(243 \\div 3 = 81\\).\n   - Then: \\(81 \\div 3 = 27\\).\n   - And: \\(27 \\div 3 = 9\\).\n   - Finally: \\(9 \\div 3 = 3\\).\n\n   Resulting in \\(729 = 3^6\\).\n   \n2. Since \\(3^6 = (3^3)^2 = 27^2\\), this supports the suspicion that 729 is a perfect square.\n\n**Strategy 3: Trial and Error**\n\n1. Just from experience, I try squaring numbers: \n   - \\(20^2 = 400\\),\n   - \\(25^2 = 625\\),\n   - \\(27^2 = 729\\).\n\nIt clicks that \\(27\\) is a good candidate.\n\n### Verification\n- Calculating directly, \\(27 \\times 27 = (20+7) \\times (20+7) = 400 + 280 + 49 = 729\\).\n- This confirms that \\(x = 27\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nTo summarize, after considering various strategies, calculating, and verifying, I've determined that the positive value of \\(x\\) is \\(27\\). All checks lead consistently to this answer, and it feels aligned with the logical approaches explored.",
