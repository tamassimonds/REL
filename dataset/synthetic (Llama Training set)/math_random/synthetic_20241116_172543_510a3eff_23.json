    "working_out": "First thoughts: Okay, we have a triangle with vertices at (2,2), (5,6), and (6,2). When I see coordinate points like this, I think about using the distance formula to calculate the lengths of the sides. This definitely reminds me of when I had to calculate distances in geometry class using coordinates. The longest side means I have to find all sides first, then compare them to see which is the longest. Let\u2019s get going and see if this approach holds up.\n\n1. Identifying the points: The triangle\u2019s vertices are given as:\n   - \\(A(2, 2)\\)\n   - \\(B(5, 6)\\)\n   - \\(C(6, 2)\\)\n\n2. Brainstorming strategies: The distance formula seems like the straightforward method to find the side lengths:\n   - The distance formula between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is: \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n   \\]\n   Using this, I'll find the lengths of sides \\(AB\\), \\(BC\\), and \\(CA\\). Hopefully, one of them will jump out as the longest, but let's do the math first.\n\n3. Calculating side length \\(AB\\):\n   - Apply the formula:\n   \\[\n   AB = \\sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n   \\]\n   Hmm, that looks reasonable as a side length.\n\n4. Calculating side length \\(BC\\):\n   - Apply the formula:\n   \\[\n   BC = \\sqrt{(6 - 5)^2 + (2 - 6)^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 16} = \\sqrt{17}\n   \\]\n   Okay, this one\u2019s more awkward because it\u2019s a square root. It's not a round number, but that's fine; I\u2019ll roll with it.\n\n5. Calculating side length \\(CA\\):\n   - Apply the formula:\n   \\[\n   CA = \\sqrt{(6 - 2)^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{16} = 4\n   \\]\n   All right, those calculations seem correct at first glance.\n\n6. Reflecting on the results: \n   - I have side lengths \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = \\sqrt{17}\\), and \\(CA = 4\\).\n   - Comparing them: \\(\\sqrt{17}\\) is approximately 4.12, so actually \\(AB = 5\\) is longer than both \\(BC\\) and \\(CA\\).\n\n7. Concluding: The longest side is \\(AB\\) and it's 5 units long. That checks out since it's the highest numeric value among the three.\n\nOops! Always good to double-check... so again, the number of units in the length of the longest side of the triangle is indeed **5 units**. I feel good about this conclusion after laying it all out step-by-step.",

  "ground_truth": "We must find the distance between each pair of points.\n\nThe distance between $(2, 2)$ and $(6, 2)$ is 4, since these two points have the same $y$-coordinate.\n\nThe distance between $(2, 2)$ and $(5, 6)$ is $\\sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = 5$.\n\nThe distance between $(5, 6)$ and $(6, 2)$ is $\\sqrt{(6 - 5)^2 + (2 - 6)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 16} = \\sqrt{17}$.\n\nOut of 4, 5, and $\\sqrt{17}$, 5 is the largest value. Thus, the longest side of the triangle has length $\\boxed{5}$."
