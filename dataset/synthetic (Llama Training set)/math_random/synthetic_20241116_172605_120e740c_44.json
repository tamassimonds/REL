  "problem": "You recently bought more than 100 eggs. The eggs are sorted in containers that can store exactly 12 eggs. However, upon inspecting the containers, you realize that two containers each hold only 11 eggs, while all the other containers hold 12 eggs. What is the smallest number of eggs you could have right now?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with an open mind and a step-by-step approach.\n\n### First Impressions\nWhen I first read this problem, my instinct is to look for patterns. It strikes me as a variant of those \"packaging\" problems where things are stored in a fixed number, but there are exceptions. We know each container can store 12 eggs, but two containers only have 11. That feels like it could be key here.\n\nThe problem specifies that we have more than 100 eggs. I\u2019m also reminded that constraints are important in these types of problems. \n\n### Brainstorming\n- Initially, I might think: \"If each container should have 12 eggs, and there are regular and irregular containers, I should find a baseline for the regular containers and then adjust for the irregular ones.\"\n- I\u2019m aware that having two containers with 11 eggs just subtracts 2 eggs from what would have been a perfectly sorted situation.\n\n### Reflecting on the Details\n- If two containers each hold only 11 eggs, that's 2 eggs fewer than expected total for those two containers, right?\n- We need a total amount that accounts for this and still exceeds 100 eggs total.\n\n### Estimation of Regular Containers\n- Suppose there are \\( n \\) full containers, each with 12 eggs.\n- Normally, you would have \\( 12n \\) eggs.\n- With two containers having 11 eggs, the effective total then becomes \\( 12n - 2 \\).\n\n### Calculate the Minimum\nNow, let's calculate the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( 12n - 2 > 100 \\).\n\n1. **Setting the inequality:**\n   \\[\n   12n - 2 > 100\n   \\]\n   Adding 2 on both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   12n > 102\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide by 12 to solve for \\( n \\):**\n   \\[\n   n > \\frac{102}{12}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the Division:**\n   - Okay, let's do this by hand or use a calculator. \\( 102 \\div 12 \\approx 8.5 \\).\n\n4. **Considering Integer Values:**\n   - Since \\( n \\) must be an integer, \\( n \\) should be at least 9.\n\n### Validating My Solution\n- If \\( n = 9 \\), then the total number of eggs, considering the deficit from two containers, is:\n  \\[\n  12 \\times 9 - 2 = 108 - 2 = 106\n  \\]\n\nThat satisfies the condition of having more than 100 eggs, and indeed it feels correct.\n\n### Checking the Result\n- Is \\( 106 \\) the minimum? \n   - If \\( n = 8 \\), \\( 12 \\times 8 - 2 = 96 - 2 = 94 \\), which is less than 100. \n   - So \\( n = 9 \\) must indeed be the smallest possible number of containers such that the total number of eggs is greater than 100.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe smallest number of eggs you could have right now is 106.\n\nBy thoroughly verifying each step of this solution, this formulation ensures that all aspects of the initial problem are met while confirming that this result is the minimum scenario surpassing the 100-egg threshold.",

  "ground_truth": "If the two containers that held 11 eggs each held 12 eggs, then the number of eggs that you have would have been a multiple of 12. However, two eggs were removed, so the number of eggs you can have is two less than a multiple of 12. Therefore, the number of eggs you could have can be written in the form $12c-2$, where $c$ represents the number of containers you have. As a result, we would like to solve the inequality $12c-2 > 100$, which has solution $c > 8\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, since the number of containers must be an integer, we must have $c=9$, so the smallest number of eggs you could have right now is $12(9) - 2 = \\boxed{106}$."
