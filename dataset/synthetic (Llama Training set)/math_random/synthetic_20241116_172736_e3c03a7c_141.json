    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\n- At first glance, this problem is about finding points that meet two conditions: being a fixed distance away from a line and a fixed distance away from another point. \n- It reminds me of geometric loci problems where curves or shapes are defined by distances to lines and points, which often points to circles or parabola shapes.\n- The idea of \"distance from a line\" typically involves horizontal or vertical lines, so the line \\( y = 13 \\) is horizontal, and \"5 units away\" forms two parallel lines, one above and one below.\n- Being \"13 units from a particular point\" sounds like a circle with radius 13 centered at that point.\n\nStrategy brainstorming: \n\n1. **Geometry and plotting**: Consider the geometry involved to visualize these loci. Plot the line \\( y = 13 \\), sketch the lines \\( y = 8 \\) and \\( y = 18 \\) (parallel lines 5 units away). Also, draw the circle centered at \\( (7, 13) \\) with a radius of 13.\n\n2. **Equations**: Mathematically represent these loci. We might need the equation of the circle \\( (x - 7)^2 + (y - 13)^2 = 169 \\) and the equations of the lines \\( y = 8 \\) and \\( y = 18 \\).\n\n3. **Intersection points**: Solve for where these lines (parallel to the original line) intersect the circle. \n\nInitial thoughts on steps: \n\n- Start with the geometric understanding.\n- Translate to algebra (set up equations).\n- Solve for intersections which gives the coordinates.\n- Check each solution fits the original conditions.\n\nStep 1: Visualize and interpret the geometric scenario.\n- We are looking at two distinct parallel lines: \\( y = 8 \\) and \\( y = 18 \\).\n- The circle is determined by having a center at \\( (7, 13) \\) with radius 13.\n\nStep 2: Convert the problem into algebraic equations.\n- Circle: \\((x - 7)^2 + (y - 13)^2 = 169\\)\n- The two lines: \\( y = 8 \\) and \\( y = 18 \\)\n\nStep 3: Solve these systems (both lines with the circle).\n\nFor \\( y = 8 \\):\n- Substitute \\( y = 8 \\) into the circle's equation:\n  \\[\n  (x - 7)^2 + (8 - 13)^2 = 169 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (x - 7)^2 + 25 = 169 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (x - 7)^2 = 144 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x - 7 = \\pm 12 \n  \\]\n\n- So, \\( x = 19 \\) or \\( x = -5 \\).\n\nIntersections with line \\( y = 8 \\): Points are \\( (19, 8) \\) and \\((-5, 8)\\).\n\nFor \\( y = 18 \\):\n- Substitute \\( y = 18 \\) into the circle's equation:\n  \\[\n  (x - 7)^2 + (18 - 13)^2 = 169 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (x - 7)^2 + 25 = 169 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (x - 7)^2 = 144 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x - 7 = \\pm 12 \n  \\]\n\n- So, \\( x = 19 \\) or \\( x = -5 \\).\n\nIntersections with line \\( y = 18 \\): Points are \\( (19, 18) \\) and \\((-5, 18)\\).\n\nStep 4: Add these coordinates up.\n- Coordinates: \\( (19, 8) \\), \\( (-5, 8) \\), \\( (19, 18) \\), \\((-5, 18)\\).\n- The sum of the x-coordinates: \\( 19 + (-5) + 19 + (-5) = 28 \\).\n- The sum of the y-coordinates: \\( 8 + 8 + 18 + 18 = 52 \\).\n\nFinal Calculation: \n- Total sum = \\( 28 + 52 = 80 \\).\n\nCheck: Revisiting the intersections and equations shows I didn\u2019t miss any conditions or intersections. The computation seems sound, so the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]",

  "ground_truth": "Let $(x,y)$ be one such point. Since $(x,y)$ is $5$ units from the line $y=13$, it must be 5 units above the line or 5 units below it.  This means that the $y$-coordinate is 8 or 18.  By the distance formula, since $(x,y)$ is 13 units from $(7,13)$, we have $$\\sqrt{(x-7)^2+(y-13)^2}=13.$$Since $y$ is either 5 more or 5 less than 13, we know that $(y-13)^2=25$. So we substitute:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x-7)^2+25}&=13\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x-7)^2+25&=13^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x-7)^2&=144\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x-7&=\\pm 12.\\\\\n\\end{align*}So we have $x-7=12$ or $x-7=-12$, giving $x=19$ or $x=-5$.\n\nPutting it all together, we have $y=8 \\text{ or } 18$ and $x=-5\\text{ or }19$, so our four possible points are $(-5,8),$ $(-5,18),$ $(19,8),$ and $(19,18).$  The sum of all of these coordinates is $\\boxed{80}$."
