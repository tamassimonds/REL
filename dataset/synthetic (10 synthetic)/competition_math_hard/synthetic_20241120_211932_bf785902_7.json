    "working_out": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We have **eight clay targets** arranged in three columns:\n\n- Two columns have **three targets each**.\n- One column has **two targets**.\n\nThe rules for breaking these targets are:\n\n1. **Choose a column.**\n2. **Break the lowest remaining target** in that chosen column.\n\nOur goal is to determine **in how many different orders** all eight targets can be broken while following these rules.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\nWhen I first look at this, it reminds me of problems involving permutations with restrictions. Perhaps considering the different ways to sequence the targets based on their columns might help. But let's explore a few strategies to see which one fits best:\n\n1. **Simple Permutation Approach:**\n   - Think of the targets as distinct and find all possible sequences.\n   - *But wait*, the rules impose constraints (must hit the lowest target in a column), so not all permutations are valid.\n\n2. **Assigning Labels with Constraints:**\n   - Label each target based on its column and position (e.g., C1T1 for Column 1, Target 1).\n   - Determine valid sequences respecting the rule of hitting the lowest target.\n\n3. **Using the Ballot Theorem or Catalan Numbers:**\n   - This reminds me of the ballot problem, where one type must always lead. Maybe Catalan numbers could play a role since they often appear in problems with hierarchical or nested constraints.\n\n4. **Recursive or Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n   - Define a recursive relation based on the number of targets left and the state of each column.\n\nI think starting with **assigning labels with constraints** might give a clearer path. If it gets too complicated, I can pivot to another strategy like the recursive approach.\n\n### Exploring the Second Strategy: Assigning Labels with Constraints\n\nLet's label each target based on its column and position:\n\n- **Column A** (3 targets): A1, A2, A3 (from bottom to top)\n- **Column B** (3 targets): B1, B2, B3\n- **Column C** (2 targets): C1, C2\n\n**Key Constraint:** For each column, a target can only be hit if all lower targets in that column have already been hit.\n\nSo, an **admissible sequence** must respect these constraints.\n\n### Brainstorming How to Count Valid Sequences\n\nTo count the number of valid orders, I need to ensure that within each column, targets are broken from bottom to top. This means:\n\n- In **Column A**: A1 must be hit before A2, and A2 before A3.\n- In **Column B**: B1 before B2, and B2 before B3.\n- In **Column C**: C1 before C2.\n\nThis suggests that within each column, the targets' sequence is fixed. However, the order in which targets from different columns are hit can vary.\n\nI\u2019m starting to see a connection to **permutations with repetitions**, where the sequence within each column is predetermined, and we need to find the number of ways to interleave these sequences.\n\n### Calculating the Total Number of Ways\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate Total Unrestricted Permutations\n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of ways to arrange all eight targets without any restrictions:\n\n\\[\n8! = 40,320\n\\]\n\nBut this includes many invalid sequences where, for example, A2 is hit before A1, violating the constraints.\n\n#### Step 2: Account for Column Constraints\n\nEach column has its own internal order that must be preserved. Let's calculate how many permutations respect these internal orders.\n\n1. **Column A (3 targets):** \n   - Only 1 valid sequence: A1, A2, A3.\n   - Total permutations = \\(3! = 6\\), but only 1 is valid.\n   - So, **1/6** of the permutations respect Column A's order.\n\n2. **Column B (3 targets):**\n   - Same as Column A: **1/6** of permutations are valid.\n\n3. **Column C (2 targets):**\n   - Only 1 valid sequence: C1, C2.\n   - Total permutations = \\(2! = 2\\), but only 1 is valid.\n   - So, **1/2** of the permutations respect Column C's order.\n\n#### Step 3: Combine the Constraints\n\nTo find the total number of valid sequences, we need to multiply the fractions of valid permutations for each column because each column's constraints are independent.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Valid permutations} = 8! \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 40,320 \\times \\frac{1}{72} = 560\n\\]\n\nHmm, that seems off. **Wait a minute!** This approach assumes that each column's constraints are independent and equally probable across all permutations, which might not be the case. The constraints could overlap in a way that this simple multiplication doesn't capture.\n\n### Reflection and Realization\n\nI realize that treating the columns' constraints as independent events might **underestimate** the complexity of the problem. Each valid sequence must interleave the targets from different columns while respecting the order within each column. This suggests a need for a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving **combinatorial enumeration** techniques like **multinomial coefficients**.\n\n### Pivoting to a Better Strategy: Multinomial Coefficients\n\nLet's think about it differently. Suppose we assign each target a \"type\" based on its column:\n\n- **3 targets in Column A**: Type A\n- **3 targets in Column B**: Type B\n- **2 targets in Column C**: Type C\n\nThe problem then becomes finding the number of ways to arrange these \"types\" such that within each type, the specific order of targets is preserved.\n\nThis is akin to arranging a sequence with repeated elements, which is handled by **multinomial coefficients**.\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the Multinomial Coefficient\n\nThe number of ways to arrange a sequence with repeated elements is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times \\ldots \\times n_k!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(n\\) is the total number of elements.\n- \\(n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k\\) are the counts of each distinct type.\n\nFor our problem:\n\n- Total targets (\\(n\\)) = 8\n- Type A targets (\\(n_1\\)) = 3\n- Type B targets (\\(n_2\\)) = 3\n- Type C targets (\\(n_3\\)) = 2\n\nSo, the number of valid sequences is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8!}{3! \\times 3! \\times 2!} = \\frac{40,320}{6 \\times 6 \\times 2} = \\frac{40,320}{72} = 560\n\\]\n\nWait, this matches our earlier calculation! But now, it **makes more sense** because we're explicitly accounting for the constraints within each column through the multinomial coefficient.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and adjusting our approach, we've determined that the number of valid sequences in which all eight targets can be broken, following the given rules, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{560}\n\\]\n\n### Final Check\n\nTo ensure this is correct, let's recap the logic:\n\n- **Each column's targets must be hit in a specific order** (bottom to top).\n- By treating targets from the same column as indistinguishable for the purposes of sequencing (i.e., respecting their internal order), we reduced the problem to arranging multi-type sequences.\n- The multinomial coefficient accounts for the repetitions and constraints simultaneously, leading us to the correct count of valid sequences.\n\nThis approach aligns with combinatorial principles and passes the sanity check, confirming that **560** is indeed the correct answer.",
