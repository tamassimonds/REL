I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness along the way, and adjusting as needed.\n\n### Problem Recap\n\nWe have a **super ball** dropped from a window **16 meters** above the ground. On each bounce, it rises to **\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)** of the previous height. The ball is caught after it reaches the high point following the **third bounce**. We need to find the total distance the ball has traveled, rounded to the nearest meter.\n\n### Brainstorming and First Thoughts\n\n- **Initial Idea:** The ball travels down to the ground and then up again after each bounce. So, I need to account for both the **descending** and **ascending** distances.\n\n- **Series of Bounces:** Since it bounces three times before being caught, there will be multiple ups and downs.\n\n- **Geometric Series:** The diminishing bounce heights remind me of a geometric series. Maybe I can use that to calculate the total distance.\n\n- **Checking Understanding:** Wait, do I need to include the distance after the third bounce? Since it's caught at the third high point, the last upward journey is included, but there's no subsequent downward trip. \n\nLet me start by listing the steps I think I'll take:\n\n1. Calculate the initial drop distance.\n2. Determine the heights for each bounce.\n3. Sum up all the descending and ascending distances.\n4. Round the total to the nearest meter.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Drop\n\nThe ball drops straight down from the window.\n\n- **Distance:** 16 meters (straight down to the ground)\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Distance} = 16 \\text{ m}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Simple enough, just the initial drop. No complications here.\n\n### Step 2: First Bounce\n\nNow, the ball bounces back up to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the initial height.\n\n- **Calculation:** \n  \\[\n  16 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 12 \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Path:** \n  - **Up:** 12 meters\n  - **Down:** 12 meters (back to the ground)\n  \n- **Adding to Total:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Distance} = 16 + 12 + 12 = 40 \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** Does it make sense? Yes, the ball goes up and then comes back down the same distance.\n\n### Step 3: Second Bounce\n\nThe ball rises to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the previous high point.\n\n- **Previous Height:** 12 meters\n- **New Height:**\n  \\[\n  12 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 9 \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Path:**\n  - **Up:** 9 meters\n  - **Down:** 9 meters\n  \n- **Adding to Total:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Distance} = 40 + 9 + 9 = 58 \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** So far, so good. The pattern seems consistent.\n\n### Step 4: Third Bounce\n\nAgain, the ball rises to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the previous height.\n\n- **Previous Height:** 9 meters\n- **New Height:**\n  \\[\n  9 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 6.75 \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Path:**\n  - **Up:** 6.75 meters\n  - **Down:** **No Down** (it's caught at this point)\n  \n- **Adding to Total:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Distance} = 58 + 6.75 = 64.75 \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** The ball is caught after reaching the third high point, so no additional downward travel.\n\n### Step 5: Rounding to the Nearest Meter\n\n- **Total Distance:** 64.75 meters\n- **Rounded:** 65 meters\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Final Total Distance} = \\boxed{65} \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Rounding up makes sense here since 0.75 is closer to 1.\n\n### Final Thoughts and Verification\n\n- **Verification:** Let's quickly recap to ensure everything adds up:\n\n  - **Initial Drop:** 16 meters\n  - **First Bounce:** 12 up + 12 down = 24 meters\n  - **Second Bounce:** 9 up + 9 down = 18 meters\n  - **Third Bounce:** 6.75 up = 6.75 meters (caught here)\n\n  Total before rounding:\n  \\[\n  16 + 24 + 18 + 6.75 = 64.75 \\text{ meters} \\rightarrow \\text{Rounded: } 65 \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Does It Make Sense?** Yes, each bounce decreases in height by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), and the calculations align with the problem statement.\n\n### Alternative Approach Check\n\n- **Geometric Series:** Initially, I thought of using a geometric series to sum the bounce heights, but since we only need up to the third bounce, manually calculating each step is straightforward and less prone to error.\n\n- **Total Travel:** Considering both up and down paths until the ball is caught ensures all distances are accounted for.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter walking through each step, verifying calculations, and reflecting on the approach, the total distance the ball traveled is **65 meters**.",

  "ground_truth": "The ball traveled $16+16\\cdot\\frac34+16\\cdot\\left(\\frac34\\right)^2 = 16+ 12+9 = 37$ meters on its three descents. The ball also traveled $16\\cdot\\frac34+16\\cdot\\left(\\frac34\\right)^2+16\\cdot\\left(\\frac34\\right)^3 = 12+9+\\frac{27}4 = 27.75$ meters on its three ascents. Thus, the ball traveled $37+27.75 = 64.75 \\approx \\boxed{65}$ meters total."
