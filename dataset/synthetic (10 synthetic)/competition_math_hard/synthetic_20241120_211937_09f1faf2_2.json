I'll walk you through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and making adjustments as needed. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst, I need to fully understand what's being asked. The question is asking for all values of \\( a \\) such that the four points \\( (0,0,0) \\), \\( (1,a,0) \\), \\( (0,1,a) \\), and \\( (a,0,1) \\) are **coplanar**.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Coplanar Points:** I remember that for points to be coplanar, they must lie on the same plane. If three points are fixed, any additional point must lie on the plane defined by those three.\n  \n- **Vectors and Determinants:** My initial thought is to use vector methods or determinants to check for coplanarity. I recall that the volume of a parallelepiped formed by three vectors is zero if and only if the vectors are coplanar. This involves calculating a determinant.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Determinant Method:** Use the determinant of a matrix formed by vectors from one point to the others. If the determinant is zero, the points are coplanar.\n   \n2. **Equation of a Plane:** Find the equation of a plane using three of the points and then check if the fourth point satisfies this equation.\n\n3. **Cross and Dot Products:** Use vector cross and dot products to determine coplanarity.\n\nI\u2019ll start with the **Determinant Method** since it directly relates to checking coplanarity through volume.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Determinant Method**\n\n**Concept:**\n\n- Create vectors from one point (say the origin \\( (0,0,0) \\)) to the other three points.\n- Set up a 3x3 matrix with these vectors.\n- Compute the determinant of this matrix.\n- If the determinant is zero, the vectors (and thus the points) are coplanar.\n\n**Setting Up the Vectors:**\n\nLet\u2019s choose the origin \\( (0,0,0) \\) as our reference point. The vectors to the other points are:\n\n- **Vector \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 \\):** From \\( (0,0,0) \\) to \\( (1,a,0) \\)  \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{v}_1 = \\langle 1, a, 0 \\rangle\n  \\]\n\n- **Vector \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 \\):** From \\( (0,0,0) \\) to \\( (0,1,a) \\)  \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\langle 0, 1, a \\rangle\n  \\]\n\n- **Vector \\( \\mathbf{v}_3 \\):** From \\( (0,0,0) \\) to \\( (a,0,1) \\)  \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{v}_3 = \\langle a, 0, 1 \\rangle\n  \\]\n\n**Forming the Matrix:**\n\nNow, I'll set up the matrix \\( M \\) using these vectors as rows (or columns):\n\n\\[\nM = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & a & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & a \\\\\na & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Computing the Determinant:**\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\( M \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\det(M) = 1(1 \\cdot 1 - a \\cdot 0) - a(0 \\cdot 1 - a \\cdot a) + 0(a \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot 1)\n\\]\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n\\[\n\\det(M) = 1(1) - a(-a^2) + 0(-1)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 + a^3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait a minute... Did I compute that correctly? Let me double-check by expanding the determinant methodically:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\det(M) = 1(1 \\cdot 1 - a \\cdot 0) - a(0 \\cdot 1 - a \\cdot a) + 0(a \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot 1)\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  = 1(1) - a(-a^2) + 0(-1)\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  = 1 + a^3\n  \\]\n  \n- Yup, that seems correct! The determinant is \\( 1 + a^3 \\).\n\n**Condition for Coplanarity:**\n\nFor the points to be coplanar, the determinant must be zero:\n\n\\[\n1 + a^3 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[\na^3 = -1 \\\\\na = -1\n\\]\n\n**Initial Conclusion:**\n\nSo, \\( a = -1 \\) is the value that makes the determinant zero, indicating that the points are coplanar.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**But wait...** Before finalizing, I should verify this result using a different method to ensure its correctness. It's always a good practice to cross-check, especially with such determinant-based problems.\n\n**Alternative Method: Equation of a Plane**\n\n**Concept:**\n\n- Use three points to determine the equation of the plane.\n- Check if the fourth point lies on this plane.\n\n**Choosing Three Points:**\n\nLet\u2019s use the points \\( (0,0,0) \\), \\( (1,a,0) \\), and \\( (0,1,a) \\) to find the plane\u2019s equation.\n\n**Finding Two Vectors in the Plane:**\n\n- **Vector \\( \\mathbf{u} \\):** From \\( (0,0,0) \\) to \\( (1,a,0) \\)  \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{u} = \\langle 1, a, 0 \\rangle\n  \\]\n\n- **Vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\):** From \\( (0,0,0) \\) to \\( (0,1,a) \\)  \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{v} = \\langle 0, 1, a \\rangle\n  \\]\n\n**Finding the Normal Vector:**\n\nThe cross product \\( \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v} \\) will give a vector normal to the plane.\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n1 & a & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & a \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nExpanding this determinant:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{i}(a \\cdot a - 0 \\cdot 1) - \\mathbf{j}(1 \\cdot a - 0 \\cdot 0) + \\mathbf{k}(1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot a)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\mathbf{i}a^2 - \\mathbf{j}a + \\mathbf{k}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\langle a^2, -a, 1 \\rangle\n\\]\n\n**Equation of the Plane:**\n\nThe equation of a plane with a normal vector \\( \\mathbf{n} = \\langle A, B, C \\rangle \\) passing through a point \\( (x_0, y_0, z_0) \\) is:\n\n\\[\nA(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( \\mathbf{n} = \\langle a^2, -a, 1 \\rangle \\) and the point \\( (0,0,0) \\):\n\n\\[\na^2x - ay + z = 0\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Fourth Point \\( (a,0,1) \\):**\n\nSubstitute \\( (a,0,1) \\) into the plane equation:\n\n\\[\na^2(a) - a(0) + 1 = 0 \\\\\na^3 + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\na^3 = -1 \\\\\na = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This **matches** our earlier result from the determinant method.\n- Both methods agree that \\( a = -1 \\) is the solution.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe value of \\( a \\) for which the points are coplanar is **\\( a = -1 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n- **Multiple Approaches:** Using both the determinant method and the plane equation method helped verify the solution's correctness. It's reassuring when different strategies lead to the same conclusion.\n  \n- **Importance of Verification:** Initially, relying solely on the determinant might seem sufficient, but cross-verifying with an alternative approach ensures that no mistakes were made.\n\n- **Understanding the Concepts:** This problem reinforced the concept of coplanarity and how determinants relate to the volume of a parallelepiped being zero.\n\n- **Learning Moment:** Always double-check your work, especially in mathematical problems where a small oversight can lead to an incorrect solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nAll points are coplanar when **\\( a = -1 \\)**.",
