  "problem": "How many \"t\"s are in \"committee\"?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I'll approach it just like I would if I were solving it on paper\u2014brainstorming different strategies, reflecting along the way, and checking my work to ensure accuracy. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Okay, the question is straightforward: *How many \"t\"s are in \"committee\"?*\n- My initial reaction is that this seems simple, but I want to make sure I don't overlook anything.\n- I remember doing similar problems before, so I think I know how to approach it, but let me brainstorm to be sure.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Should I just count the letters manually?\n- Maybe I can write the word down and tally as I go.\n- Is there a pattern or strategy that would make this easier?\n\n**Checking In:**\n- Wait, what if there's a trick to the question? Better double-check my approach to avoid mistakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Manual Counting**\n- **Thought Process:** Let's start by writing down the word and counting each \"t\".\n- **Action:**  \n  - Write: c o m m i t t e e\n  - Count each letter one by one.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems straightforward, but I might miss a letter if I'm not careful.\n- Let me try it and see if it works.\n\n**Strategy 2: Using Tally Marks**\n- **Thought Process:** To avoid losing track, I can use tally marks for each \"t\" I encounter.\n- **Action:**  \n  - For each \"t\", I\u2019ll make a tally mark.\n\n**Strategy 3: Visual Inspection**\n- **Thought Process:** Maybe I can visually inspect the word and see if there's a pattern or grouping.\n- **Action:**  \n  - Look for clusters or repeated letters.\n\n**Brainstorming Outcome:**\n- Manual counting with tally marks seems the most reliable for now. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Implementing Strategy 1 - Manual Counting**\n\n**Action:**\n- Let me write out the word and count each letter.\n\n  ```\n  c o m m i t t e e\n  ```\n\n- Counting each letter:\n  - c \u2192 Not a \"t\"\n  - o \u2192 Not a \"t\"\n  - m \u2192 Not a \"t\"\n  - m \u2192 Not a \"t\"\n  - i \u2192 Not a \"t\"\n  - **t \u2192 First \"t\"**\n  - **t \u2192 Second \"t\"**\n  - e \u2192 Not a \"t\"\n  - e \u2192 Not a \"t\"\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I counted two \"t\"s manually.\n- But wait, what if I missed something? Better double-check to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Double-Checking with Strategy 2 - Tally Marks**\n\n**Action:**\n- Let\u2019s go through the word again, making a tally mark for each \"t\".\n\n  ```\n  c \u2192  \n  o \u2192  \n  m \u2192  \n  m \u2192  \n  i \u2192  \n  t \u2192 || (First tally)\n  t \u2192 || (Second tally)\n  e \u2192  \n  e \u2192\n  ```\n\n- Total tallies: ||\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Confirmed: Two tally marks mean there are two \"t\"s.\n- This method reinforces my initial count.\n\n**Checking In:**\n- Does this make sense? Yes, both strategies agree. Feeling more confident now.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Implementing Strategy 3 - Visual Inspection**\n\n**Action:**\n- Let\u2019s look for patterns or clusters in the word.\n\n  ```\n  c o m m i t t e e\n  ```\n\n- Observing the word:\n  - The \"t\"s are together in the middle of the word.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Seeing that the \"t\"s are clustered helps confirm the count.\n- This visual check aligns with the previous methods.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- All three strategies consistently show two \"t\"s.\n- No discrepancies found, so the count seems accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Validating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Did I consider all letters? Yes.\n- Did multiple strategies yield the same result? Yes.\n- Is there any possibility of missing a \"t\"? No, all methods agree.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- Having used manual counting, tally marks, and visual inspection, I'm confident in the accuracy of the answer.\n- No errors detected, and the consistency across different strategies reinforces the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Conclusion:**\n\n<ANSWER>There are **two \"t\"s** in \"committee\".</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Check and Reflection**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- By exploring multiple strategies and consistently arriving at the same result, I've ensured the accuracy of the answer.\n- Reflecting on the process helped catch any potential oversights and confirmed the reliability of the methods used.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The problem seemed simple at first, but taking the time to brainstorm and verify using different strategies ensured a correct and confident answer.\n- This approach not only provided accuracy but also reinforced problem-solving skills by validating through multiple methods.",
