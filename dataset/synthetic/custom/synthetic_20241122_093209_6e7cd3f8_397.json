  "problem": "How many \"p\"s are in \"poppycock\"?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, we're dealing with the question: *How many \"p\"s are in \"poppycock\"?* My initial reaction is that this seems straightforward\u2014just counting letters in a word. But I want to make sure I approach it carefully to avoid any silly mistakes.\n\nI think I remember doing something similar before, like when checking for typos in a text. Maybe I can apply the same strategy here.\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Manual Counting:** Just look at the word and count the \"p\"s with my eyes.\n   \n2. **Writing It Out:** Write the word down and mark each \"p\" as I see it.\n\n3. **Using a Tally System:** Create a tally mark for each \"p\" to keep track.\n\nHmm, I think starting with manual counting makes sense. If that feels unreliable, I can try writing it out or using tallies.\n\n### **Step 1: Manual Counting**\n\nLet\u2019s look at the word \u201cpoppycock\u201d and count the \u201cp\u201ds:\n\np o p p y c o c k\n\nI see one \u201cp\u201d at the beginning... wait, there's another one right after it. Actually, there are two \u201cp\u201ds together. Let me count again to be sure:\n\n- First \u201cp\u201d: 1\n- Second \u201cp\u201d: 2\n\n**Total so far:** 2 \u201cp\u201ds.\n\n### **Reflecting on This Approach:**\n\nBut hold on, that's just at the beginning. I need to check the whole word. Let me go through each letter to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\n### **Step 2: Re-Counting Each Letter**\n\nI'll go through the word letter by letter:\n\n- p: 1\n- o: 0\n- p: 1 (total 2)\n- p: 1 (total 3)\n- y: 0\n- c: 0\n- o: 0\n- c: 0\n- k: 0\n\nWait a minute, I counted three \u201cp\u201ds, but earlier I thought there were only two. This seems off. Let me think...\n\n### **Realizing a Mistake:**\n\nOh! I counted the second \u201cp\u201d twice because there are two \u201cp\u201ds back-to-back, but they only account for one additional \u201cp,\u201d not two separate ones.\n\n### **Checking Work:**\n\nLet's use a different method to confirm.\n\n### **Step 3: Writing It Out**\n\nI'll write the word down and underline each \u201cp\u201d:\n\n**p p** o **p p** y c o c k\n\nActually, this makes it clearer. There are two distinct \u201cp\u201ds at the beginning.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Using a Tally System**\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's make a tally for each \u201cp\u201d I find:\n\n- First \u201cp\u201d: |\n- Second \u201cp\u201d: |\n\n**Total tallies:** ||\n\nThat's 2 \u201cp\u201ds.\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\nLooking at all methods\u2014manual counting, writing it out, and tallying\u2014they all confirm the same result.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n<ANSWER> There are 2 \u201cp\u201ds in \u201cpoppycock\u201d. </ANSWER>\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nInitially, I almost overcounted by misinterpreting the back-to-back \u201cp\u201ds. Reflecting and using multiple strategies helped catch that mistake. It's a good reminder that double-checking, especially with simple problems, can prevent errors.\n\n---",
