    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll walk through my initial thoughts, brainstorm different strategies, reflect if they're working, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving this manually.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, the equation given is:\n\n\\[\nf((x - y)^2) = f(x)^2 - 2xf(y) + y^2\n\\]\n\nfor all real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nMy initial reaction is that this looks like a functional equation, which often involves exploring properties of the function \\(f\\) to determine its form. Functional equations can sometimes be reminiscent of algebraic identities or properties of known functions, but I'm not immediately sure what kind of function \\(f\\) could satisfy this.\n\nI remember dealing with similar problems where plugging in specific values helps identify the function, but I'm also aware that not every approach will lead directly to the solution. Maybe starting with simple substitutions could help.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Substitute Specific Values:**\n   - Try plugging in specific values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to see if a pattern emerges or if it reveals something about \\(f\\).\n\n2. **Check for Common Functions:**\n   - Consider if \\(f\\) could be a polynomial, linear, or perhaps even the identity function.\n\n3. **Analyze Symmetry:**\n   - Look for symmetries in the equation that could simplify it.\n\n4. **Guess and Verify:**\n   - Make an educated guess about the form of \\(f\\) and verify if it satisfies the equation.\n\nNone of these seem like a guaranteed starting point, but substituting specific values seems like a reasonable first step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Substituting Specific Values**\n\n**Substitution 1: Let \\(x = y = 0\\)**\n\n\\[\nf((0 - 0)^2) = f(0)^2 - 2 \\cdot 0 \\cdot f(0) + 0^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nf(0) = f(0)^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, this gives me \\(f(0) = f(0)^2\\). That suggests \\(f(0)\\) could be either 0 or 1, since those are the solutions to \\(f(t) = t^2\\). But I need more information to decide which one.\n\n**Substitution 2: Let \\(x = y = 1\\)**\n\n\\[\nf((1 - 1)^2) = f(1)^2 - 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot f(1) + 1^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nf(0) = f(1)^2 - 2f(1) + 1\n\\]\n\n**Wait a minute:** I already know that \\(f(0) = f(0)^2\\), so I can use that here.\n\nIf \\(f(0) = 0\\), then:\n\n\\[\n0 = f(1)^2 - 2f(1) + 1 \\implies f(1)^2 - 2f(1) + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis factors to:\n\n\\[\n(f(1) - 1)^2 = 0 \\implies f(1) = 1\n\\]\n\nIf \\(f(0) = 1\\), then:\n\n\\[\n1 = f(1)^2 - 2f(1) + 1 \\implies f(1)^2 - 2f(1) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis factors to:\n\n\\[\nf(1)(f(1) - 2) = 0 \\implies f(1) = 0 \\text{ or } f(1) = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, depending on the value of \\(f(0)\\), \\(f(1)\\) could be either 1 (if \\(f(0) = 0\\)), or 0 and 2 (if \\(f(0) = 1\\)). This suggests that \\(f(1)\\) could have multiple possible values.\n\nBut before concluding, let's see if we can determine which of these are valid by checking consistency with the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Checking Consistency with the Original Equation**\n\n**Suppose \\(f(1) = 1\\) and \\(f(0) = 0\\):**\n\nLet's see if this satisfies the original equation.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\\[\nf((x - y)^2) = f(x)^2 - 2xf(y) + y^2\n\\]\n\nSelect \\(x = 1\\), \\(y = 0\\):\n\n\\[\nf((1 - 0)^2) = f(1)^2 - 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot f(0) + 0^2\n\\]\n\nThis becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(1^2) = 1^2 - 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\\\\nf(1) = 1 - 0 + 0 \\\\\nf(1) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSeems consistent! But let\u2019s check another case to be sure.\n\n**Now suppose \\(f(1) = 2\\) and \\(f(0) = 1\\):**\n\nSelect \\(x = 1\\), \\(y = 1\\):\n\n\\[\nf((1 - 1)^2) = f(1)^2 - 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot f(1) + 1^2\n\\]\n\nThis becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(0) = 2^2 - 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\\\\nf(0) = 4 - 4 + 1 \\\\\nf(0) = 1\n\\]\n\nBut we assumed \\(f(0) = 1\\), so it\u2019s consistent.\n\n**Now suppose \\(f(1) = 0\\) and \\(f(0) = 1\\):**\n\nSelect \\(x = 1\\), \\(y = 0\\):\n\n\\[\nf((1 - 0)^2) = f(1)^2 - 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot f(0) + 0^2\n\\]\n\nThis becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(1) = 0^2 - 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\\\\nf(1) = 0 - 2 + 0 \\\\\nf(1) = -2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a second! This suggests \\(f(1) = -2\\), but earlier we found that \\(f(1)\\) could only be 0 or 2 if \\(f(0) = 1\\). Something doesn't add up.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s analyze where the inconsistency might be happening.\n\nFrom the substitution earlier:\n\n- If \\(f(0) = 0\\), \\(f(1) = 1\\).\n- If \\(f(0) = 1\\), \\(f(1) = 0\\) or \\(f(1) = 2\\).\n\nBut when checking \\(f(1) = 0\\) and \\(f(0) = 1\\), we got \\(f(1) = -2\\).\n\n**Realization:**\n\nThis suggests that not all combinations are valid. Perhaps \\(f(1) = 0\\) and \\(f(0) = 1\\) leads to an inconsistency.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\nIt seems that \\(f(1) = 0\\) might not be a valid solution after all. Let\u2019s re-examine the cases where \\(f(0) = 0\\) and \\(f(0) = 1\\) to see if \\(f(1) = 0\\) is indeed possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Re-Examining the Cases**\n\n**Case 1: \\( f(0) = 0 \\)**\n\nFrom earlier, \\(f(1) = 1\\).\n\n**Case 2: \\( f(0) = 1 \\)**\n\nFrom earlier, \\(f(1) = 0\\) or \\(f(1) = 2\\).\n\nBut when checking \\(f(1) = 0\\) and \\(f(0) = 1\\), we got an inconsistency.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt seems that \\(f(1) = 0\\) doesn't align with the original equation. Therefore, the only consistent solutions are:\n\n- \\(f(1) = 1\\) when \\(f(0) = 0\\).\n- \\(f(1) = 2\\) when \\(f(0) = 1\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSo, the possible values of \\(f(1)\\) are 1 and 2.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determining \\(n\\) and \\(s\\)**\n\n**Possible Values of \\(f(1)\\):** 1 and 2.\n\n**Number of Possible Values (\\(n\\)):** 2.\n\n**Sum of Possible Values (\\(s\\)):** \\(1 + 2 = 3\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, just to be absolutely sure, let me quickly verify if both \\(f(1) = 1\\) and \\(f(1) = 2\\) are indeed valid.\n\n**Suppose \\(f(1) = 2\\) and \\(f(0) = 1\\):**\n\nSelect \\(x = 1\\), \\(y = 1\\):\n\n\\[\nf((1 - 1)^2) = f(1)^2 - 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot f(1) + 1^2\n\\]\n\nThis becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(0) = 2^2 - 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\\\\nf(0) = 4 - 4 + 1 \\\\\nf(0) = 1\n\\]\n\nWhich is consistent with our assumption. So, \\(f(1) = 2\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nBoth \\(f(1) = 1\\) and \\(f(1) = 2\\) satisfy the original equation based on the cases analyzed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating \\(n \\times s\\)**\n\n\\[\nn = 2, \\quad s = 1 + 2 = 3 \\\\\nn \\times s = 2 \\times 3 = 6\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Brainstorming Strategies:** Initially considered substituting specific values, checking for common functions, analyzing symmetry, and making educated guesses.\n\n2. **Substituting Specific Values:** \n   - Found that \\(f(0) = f(0)^2\\) implies \\(f(0) = 0\\) or \\(1\\).\n   - Determined possible values of \\(f(1)\\) based on \\(f(0)\\).\n\n3. **Checking Consistency:** \n   - Verified that \\(f(1) = 1\\) and \\(f(1) = 2\\) are consistent with the original equation.\n   - Identified that \\(f(1) = 0\\) leads to an inconsistency.\n\n4. **Determining \\(n\\) and \\(s\\):** \n   - Concluded that \\(f(1)\\) can be 1 or 2, making \\(n = 2\\) and \\(s = 3\\).\n\n5. **Calculating Final Answer:** \n   - Computed \\(n \\times s = 6\\).\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected on each step to ensure consistency with the original equation, and adjusted my approach when an inconsistency arose. This iterative checking helped solidify the correctness of the final answer.",
