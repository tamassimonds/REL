Here we go:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with a parabola that has specific properties:\n\n1. **Passes through the point \\((1,5)\\).**\n2. **The \\(y\\)-coordinate of the focus is 3.**\n3. **Axis of symmetry is parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis.**\n4. **Vertex lies on the \\(y\\)-axis.**\n\nWe need to express the parabola's equation in the form:\n\\[\nax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), \\(d\\), \\(e\\), and \\(f\\) are integers, \\(c\\) is positive, and \\(\\gcd(|a|, |b|, |c|, |d|, |e|, |f|) = 1\\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- This reminds me of parabolas I\u2019ve studied before, especially those with horizontally oriented axes.\n- I'm thinking about using the standard form of a parabola that opens either left or right since the axis of symmetry is parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis.\n- Also, the fact that the vertex lies on the \\(y\\)-axis suggests the vertex has an \\(x\\)-coordinate of 0.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Use the Standard Form of a Parabola:**\n   - For a parabola opening left or right: \\((y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex.\n   \n2. **Incorporate Given Points and Properties:**\n   - Substitute the known point \\((1, 5)\\) into the equation.\n   - Use the focus's \\(y\\)-coordinate to find parameters.\n   \n3. **Solve for Vertex and Parameters:**\n   - Since the vertex is on the \\(y\\)-axis, \\(h = 0\\).\n   - Determine \\(k\\) and \\(p\\) using the focus and given point.\n\n**Wait a Minute\u2026**\n- The standard form with horizontal axis is \\((y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)\\), which seems straightforward.\n- But what about the \\(bxy\\) term? I don't recall dealing with that in the standard horizontal parabola equation.\n- Maybe we need to adjust the standard form to account for all terms in the general equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Standard Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's start with the general form of a parabola with a horizontal axis:\n  \\[\n  (y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)\n  \\]\n- Given that the vertex is on the \\(y\\)-axis, \\(h = 0\\). So, the equation simplifies to:\n  \\[\n  (y - k)^2 = 4px\n  \\]\n  \n**But Wait\u2026**\n- This looks too simple because we need to express it in the general form with \\(ax^2\\), \\(bxy\\), etc.\n- Maybe we need to express this differently to match the required form.\n\n**Exploring Another Approach:**\n- Perhaps consider rotating the coordinate system if the parabola isn\u2019t aligned with the axes, but the problem states the axis of symmetry is parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis. So, rotation might not be necessary.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I think I'll stick with the standard form for now and see how it fits into the general equation. If it doesn't, maybe a transformation is needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing in General Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Take the simplified standard form:\n  \\[\n  (y - k)^2 = 4px\n  \\]\n- Expand it to fit into the general quadratic equation:\n  \\[\n  y^2 - 2ky + k^2 = 4px\n  \\]\n- Rearranging:\n  \\[\n  y^2 - 2ky - 4px + k^2 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n**Checkpoint:**\n- Comparing with \\(ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0\\):\n  - \\(a = 0\\) (no \\(x^2\\) term)\n  - \\(b = 0\\) (no \\(xy\\) term)\n  - \\(c = 1\\) (coefficient of \\(y^2\\))\n  - \\(d = -4p\\) (coefficient of \\(x\\))\n  - \\(e = -2k\\) (coefficient of \\(y\\))\n  - \\(f = k^2\\) (constant term)\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- This seems to make sense so far. But we need to determine \\(p\\) and \\(k\\) using the given properties.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Utilizing the Focus's \\(y\\)-Coordinate**\n\n**Given:**\n- The \\(y\\)-coordinate of the focus is 3.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- In a parabola, the focus is located at \\((h + p, k)\\) for horizontally oriented parabolas.\n- Since \\(h = 0\\), the focus is at \\((p, k)\\).\n- We know the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the focus is 3, so \\(k = 3\\).\n\n**Equation Update:**\n- Now the equation becomes:\n  \\[\n  y^2 - 6y - 4px + 9 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- This gives me the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the vertex as well since for parabolas, the vertex is at \\((h, k)\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this align with the properties?\n  - Yes, the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the focus is indeed 3, matching the given.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Incorporating the Given Point \\((1, 5)\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- We have the point \\((1, 5)\\) lying on the parabola.\n- Substitute \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 5\\) into the equation to find \\(p\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n5^2 - 6(5) - 4p(1) + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n25 - 30 - 4p + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n4 - 4p = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n4p = 4 \\implies p = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, \\(p = 1\\)? That seems reasonable because it indicates the distance from the vertex to the focus is 1 unit.\n\n**Check:**\n- Let's verify by plugging \\(p = 1\\) back into the equation:\n  \\[\n  y^2 - 6y - 4(1)x + 9 = 0 \\implies y^2 - 6y - 4x + 9 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n**Does This Work?**\n- Yes, it simplifies correctly, and the point \\((1, 5)\\) satisfies it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finalizing the Equation**\n\n**Equation So Far:**\n\\[\ny^2 - 6y - 4x + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Ensure that this equation satisfies all given properties.\n- From here, we need to express it in the form \\(ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0\\) with integer coefficients and check the gcd condition.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The current equation is already in the desired form, but let's rearrange it to match the standard general quadratic equation order.\n\n**Rearranging:**\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4x - 6y + 9\n\\]\n\\[\ny^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0 \\implies 0 = -4x + y^2 - 6y + 9\n\\]\n\n**Is This Okay?**\n- Yes, but for clarity, let's write it as:\n  \\[\n  y^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Looks good, but we need to ensure \\(c\\) is positive and coefficients are integers with \\(\\gcd = 1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Ensuring \\(c\\) is Positive and GCD Condition**\n\n**Current Equation:**\n\\[\ny^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Identifying Coefficients:**\n- \\(a = 0\\)\n- \\(b = 0\\)\n- \\(c = 1\\) (since \\(y^2\\) coefficient is 1)\n- \\(d = -4\\)\n- \\(e = -6\\)\n- \\(f = 9\\)\n\n**GCD Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\gcd(0, 0, 1, -4, -6, 9) = 1\n\\]\n  \n**Wait, Is This Correct?**\n- Yes, because the only common divisor among the absolute values is 1.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This satisfies all the conditions: integer coefficients, \\(c\\) positive, and \\(\\gcd = 1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Expressing the Equation in the Required Form**\n\n**Final Equation:**\n\\[\ny^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Expressing in Standard Form:**\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4x - 6y + 9\n\\]\n\\[\ny^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\ny^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- This equation meets all the problem's requirements.\n- It expresses the parabola in the desired general form with integer coefficients.\n- \\(c\\) is positive, and the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of the coefficients is 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Validation:**\n  - Starting with the standard form was a good strategy.\n  - Incorporating the given point and focus\u2019s \\(y\\)-coordinate helped solve for the necessary parameters.\n  \n- **Checking Work:**\n  - Throughout, verifying each step ensured that the final equation satisfied all given properties.\n  \n- **Alternative Strategies:**\n  - Considering coordinate transformations or verifying through different parabola properties could be alternatives, but they weren't necessary here.\n  \n- **Mistakes and Corrections:**\n  - Initially unsure about handling the \\(bxy\\) term, but recognizing that wasn't needed based on the given properties simplified the process.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- By meticulously following each property and continuously checking for correctness, I arrived at the correct equation representing the parabola.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed process mimics human-like thinking, including brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies to arrive at the correct solution!",
