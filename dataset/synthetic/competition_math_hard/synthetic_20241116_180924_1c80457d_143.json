    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were solving it manually. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, I see that it's about **primitive roots modulo a prime \\( p \\)**. I remember that primitive roots are elements that can generate all the non-zero residues modulo \\( p \\) through exponentiation. \n\nThis kind of problem reminds me of topics like **group theory** and **number theory** that we've discussed before. However, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions and properties, especially how to determine if an integer is a primitive root.\n\nHonestly, my first instinct is to **list out the integers** and see which ones might be primitive roots by checking their powers. But that seems tedious. Maybe there's a more systematic way, like using properties of primitive roots or Euler's theorem.\n\nI also recall that for a prime \\( p \\), there are \\( \\phi(p-1) \\) primitive roots, where \\( \\phi \\) is Euler's totient function. This might help narrow down the candidates.\n\nBut before diving deep, let's **explore different strategies**:\n\n1. **Listing Exponents:** Compute the powers of each integer modulo \\( p \\) and see if they cover all residues from 1 to \\( p-1 \\).\n2. **Use Euler's Criterion or Fermat's Little Theorem:** Maybe there's a theorem that can help determine primitive roots without listing all powers.\n3. **Check Orders of Elements:** In group theory, an element's order can tell us if it's a generator (primitive root) or not.\n\nI'll start with **Listing Exponents**, as it's straightforward. If this doesn't work well, I'll pivot to using theorems or checking orders.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Listing Exponents for Each Integer \\( a \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\pmod{7} \\)**\n\nLet's begin by computing the powers of each integer modulo 7. The goal is to see if the set \\( \\{a, a^2, a^3, \\ldots, a^{p-1}\\} \\) covers all integers from 1 to \\( p-1 \\).\n\nI'll calculate \\( a^k \\pmod{7} \\) for each \\( a \\) and \\( k \\) up to 6 (since \\( p-1 = 6 \\)).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **For \\( a = 1 \\):**\n  - \\( 1^1 \\equiv 1 \\)\n  - \\( 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\)\n  - \\( 1^3 \\equiv 1 \\)\n  - \\( 1^4 \\equiv 1 \\)\n  - \\( 1^5 \\equiv 1 \\)\n  - \\( 1^6 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\n  **Observation:** All powers are 1. So \\( a = 1 \\) is **not** a primitive root because it doesn't cover all residues.\n\n- **For \\( a = 2 \\):**\n  - \\( 2^1 \\equiv 2 \\)\n  - \\( 2^2 \\equiv 4 \\)\n  - \\( 2^3 \\equiv 1 \\)\n  - \\( 2^4 \\equiv 2 \\)\n  - \\( 2^5 \\equiv 4 \\)\n  - \\( 2^6 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\n  **Observation:** The set repeats {2, 4, 1}. So \\( a = 2 \\) is **not** a primitive root.\n\n- **For \\( a = 3 \\):**\n  - \\( 3^1 \\equiv 3 \\)\n  - \\( 3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 2 \\)\n  - \\( 3^3 \\equiv 6 \\)\n  - \\( 3^4 \\equiv 18 \\equiv 4 \\)\n  - \\( 3^5 \\equiv 12 \\equiv 5 \\)\n  - \\( 3^6 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\n  **Observation:** The set is {3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1}. It covers all residues 1 to 6. So \\( a = 3 \\) **is** a primitive root.\n\n- **For \\( a = 4 \\):**\n  - \\( 4^1 \\equiv 4 \\)\n  - \\( 4^2 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 2 \\)\n  - \\( 4^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 1 \\)\n  - \\( 4^4 \\equiv 4 \\)\n  - \\( 4^5 \\equiv 2 \\)\n  - \\( 4^6 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\n  **Observation:** The set repeats {4, 2, 1}. So \\( a = 4 \\) is **not** a primitive root.\n\n- **For \\( a = 5 \\):**\n  - \\( 5^1 \\equiv 5 \\)\n  - \\( 5^2 \\equiv 25 \\equiv 4 \\)\n  - \\( 5^3 \\equiv 20 \\equiv 6 \\)\n  - \\( 5^4 \\equiv 30 \\equiv 2 \\)\n  - \\( 5^5 \\equiv 10 \\equiv 3 \\)\n  - \\( 5^6 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\n  **Observation:** The set is {5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1}. It covers all residues. So \\( a = 5 \\) **is** a primitive root.\n\n- **For \\( a = 6 \\):**\n  - \\( 6^1 \\equiv 6 \\)\n  - \\( 6^2 \\equiv 36 \\equiv 1 \\)\n  - \\( 6^3 \\equiv 6 \\)\n  - \\( 6^4 \\equiv 1 \\)\n  - \\( 6^5 \\equiv 6 \\)\n  - \\( 6^6 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\n  **Observation:** The set repeats {6, 1}. So \\( a = 6 \\) is **not** a primitive root.\n\n**Reflecting on the Results:**\nFrom these calculations, only \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( a = 5 \\) are primitive roots modulo 7. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Each primitive root should generate all non-zero residues {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. From \\( a = 3 \\):\n- \\( 3^1 \\equiv 3 \\)\n- \\( 3^2 \\equiv 2 \\)\n- \\( 3^3 \\equiv 6 \\)\n- \\( 3^4 \\equiv 4 \\)\n- \\( 3^5 \\equiv 5 \\)\n- \\( 3^6 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\nSimilarly, for \\( a = 5 \\):\n- \\( 5^1 \\equiv 5 \\)\n- \\( 5^2 \\equiv 4 \\)\n- \\( 5^3 \\equiv 6 \\)\n- \\( 5^4 \\equiv 2 \\)\n- \\( 5^5 \\equiv 3 \\)\n- \\( 5^6 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\nBoth \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( a = 5 \\) indeed generate all residues 1 to 6.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:** \nOnly \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( a = 5 \\) are primitive roots modulo 7.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\nNow that I've listed the exponents and identified which integers are primitive roots, I want to explore if there's a more efficient method to confirm these results.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:** \nUse the fact that for a number \\( a \\) to be a primitive root modulo \\( p \\), its order should be \\( p-1 \\). The order of \\( a \\) is the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( a^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\).\n\nThis means that \\( a \\) must be **primitive** and **not** satisfy \\( a^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) for any divisor \\( d \\) of \\( p-1 \\) except \\( d = p-1 \\).\n\nLet\u2019s consider this approach for \\( p = 7 \\), where \\( p - 1 = 6 \\). The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.\n\nSo, a primitive root should not satisfy:\n- \\( a^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\) (which would make \\( a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\))\n- \\( a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( a^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nThis means that any integer that satisfies \\( a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\) or \\( a^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\) (excluding \\( a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)) is **not** a primitive root.\n\nLet's apply this to verify our earlier findings.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **\\( a = 2 \\):**\n  - \\( 2^2 \\equiv 4 \\neq 1 \\)\n  - \\( 2^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\n  **Observation:** \\( a = 2 \\) satisfies \\( a^3 \\equiv 1 \\), so it's **not** a primitive root. This aligns with our earlier result.\n\n- **\\( a = 4 \\):**\n  - \\( 4^2 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 2 \\neq 1 \\)\n  - \\( 4^3 \\equiv 64 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\n  **Observation:** \\( a = 4 \\) satisfies \\( a^3 \\equiv 1 \\), so it's **not** a primitive root. This also aligns with our earlier result.\n\n- **\\( a = 6 \\):**\n  - \\( 6^2 \\equiv 36 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\n  **Observation:** \\( a = 6 \\) satisfies \\( a^2 \\equiv 1 \\), so it's **not** a primitive root. Again, this matches our earlier findings.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis alternative strategy confirms that \\( a = 2 \\), \\( a = 4 \\), and \\( a = 6 \\) are **not** primitive roots, aligning perfectly with the initial approach. \n\nHowever, it also suggests that \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( a = 5 \\) do not satisfy these conditions, reinforcing that they are indeed primitive roots.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 2:**\nThe alternative strategy supports the initial findings, confirming that \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( a = 5 \\) are the primitive roots modulo 7.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Summing the Primitive Roots**\n\nNow that we've identified the primitive roots \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( a = 5 \\), the next step is to calculate their sum.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n3 + 5 = 8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems straightforward. Adding the two primitive roots gives us 8. But just to ensure everything is correct, let's **double-check** if these roots indeed satisfy the primitive root condition.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- \\( 3^1 \\equiv 3 \\)\n- \\( 3^2 \\equiv 2 \\)\n- \\( 3^3 \\equiv 6 \\)\n- \\( 3^4 \\equiv 4 \\)\n- \\( 3^5 \\equiv 5 \\)\n- \\( 3^6 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\nAll residues {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} are covered.\n\nSimilarly for \\( a = 5 \\):\n- \\( 5^1 \\equiv 5 \\)\n- \\( 5^2 \\equiv 4 \\)\n- \\( 5^3 \\equiv 6 \\)\n- \\( 5^4 \\equiv 2 \\)\n- \\( 5^5 \\equiv 3 \\)\n- \\( 5^6 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\nAll residues are also covered.\n\nSince both primitive roots generate all non-zero residues, the sum of 8 is indeed correct.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 3:**\nThe sum of all integers in the set \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\) that are primitive roots \\( \\pmod{7} \\) is **8**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout this problem, exploring multiple strategies helped ensure the correctness of the solution. Initially, listing exponents provided a direct way to identify primitive roots, but considering properties related to the order of elements offered a more theoretical verification.\n\nChecking each step and reflecting on the findings confirmed that \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( a = 5 \\) are indeed primitive roots, and their sum is correctly calculated as 8.\n\nBy embracing a **step-by-step** approach and being willing to **reassess strategies**, I ensured a thorough and accurate solution.\n\n**Final Answer:** \nThe sum of all integers in the set \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\) that are primitive roots \\( \\pmod{7} \\) is **8**.",

  "ground_truth": "Obviously, $1$ is not a primitive root $\\pmod 7$ (its powers are all congruent to $1$!).\n\nExamining the powers of $2$, we see that $\\{2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,\\ldots\\} \\equiv \\{2,4,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ with repetition from this point onward. Since the powers of $2$ do not include all residues from $1$ to $6\\pmod 7$, we see that $2$ is not a primitive root.\n\nThe logic of this example can be generalized. If $a$ is an integer and $a^k\\equiv 1\\pmod p$, then the powers of $a$ repeat on a cycle of length at most $k$. Therefore, for $a$ to be a primitive root, it is necessary that $a^k\\not\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ for all positive $k$ smaller than $p-1$. Conversely, if $a^k\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ for some positive $k$ smaller than $p-1$, then $a$ is not a primitive root $\\pmod p$. As examples, $4$ and $6$ are not primitive roots $\\pmod 7$, because $4^3\\equiv 1\\pmod 7$ and $6^2\\equiv 1\\pmod 7$.\n\nThis leaves $3$ and $5$ as candidates. Checking the powers of $3$ and $5$ modulo $7$, we see that \\begin{align*}\n3^1\\equiv 3,~ 3^2\\equiv 2,~3^3 \\equiv 6,~3^4\\equiv 4,~3^5\\equiv 5,~ 3^6\\equiv 1;\\\\\n5^1\\equiv 5,~ 5^2\\equiv 4,~5^3 \\equiv 6,~5^4\\equiv 2,~5^5\\equiv 3,~ 5^6\\equiv 1.\\,\n\\end{align*}Thus, $3,5$ are primitive roots of $7$, so the desired sum is $3+5=\\boxed{8}$."
