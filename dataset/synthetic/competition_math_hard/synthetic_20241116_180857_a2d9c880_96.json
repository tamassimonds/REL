    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, reflecting and brainstorming along the way to ensure we understand it fully and to explore different strategies. \n\n---\n\n### First Thoughts:\n\nAlright, looking at the problem:\n\n- **Given:** The fifth term of a geometric sequence is \\(11\\), and the eleventh term is \\(5\\).\n- **Required:** Find the eighth term in the sequence and express it in the simplest radical form.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Geometric Sequence:** I remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a constant factor (common ratio) to get the next term. So, the relationship between the terms involves powers of the common ratio.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Express Terms Using Common Ratio:** Write the terms in terms of the first term and the common ratio. \n  2. **Use Logarithms:** Since we're dealing with powers, maybe logarithms could help solve for the common ratio.\n  3. **Set Up Equations:** Create equations based on the given terms to solve for the common ratio and the first term.\n\n- **Reflection:** The first strategy seems straightforward\u2014expressing the terms in terms of the first term and the common ratio. But I'm thinking, would it be easier to use logarithms given that we're dealing with powers? However, using logarithms might complicate things unnecessarily. \n\n- **Conclusion:** Let's start with expressing the terms using the common ratio. If it gets too complicated, we can pivot to another method.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Express the Given Terms Using the Common Ratio\n\n**Applying Strategy 1:**\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( a \\) = the first term\n- \\( r \\) = the common ratio\n\nFrom the geometric sequence:\n- Fifth term: \\( a r^4 = 11 \\)\n- Eleventh term: \\( a r^{10} = 5 \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- We have two equations involving \\( a \\) and \\( r \\). \n- I can try to eliminate one variable by dividing these equations to solve for \\( r \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nDivide the second equation by the first:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a r^{10}}{a r^4} = \\frac{5}{11}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nr^6 = \\frac{5}{11}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, that simplification looks correct because dividing powers of \\( r \\) subtracts the exponents (\\(10 - 4 = 6\\)). So, \\( r^6 = \\frac{5}{11} \\) seems right.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Solve for the Common Ratio \\( r \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find \\( r \\), I need to take the sixth root of both sides since \\( r^6 = \\frac{5}{11} \\).\n- However, taking roots can sometimes lead to multiple solutions. But since the sequence consists of positive numbers, \\( r \\) must be positive.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{1/6}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nSince we're dealing with a geometric sequence of positive numbers, \\( r \\) must be positive. Taking the sixth root of a positive fraction makes sense here.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Express the Eighth Term in Terms of \\( a \\) and \\( r \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that we have \\( r \\), we can find the eighth term.\n- The eighth term is given by \\( a r^7 \\).\n- But we still need to find \\( a \\). Let's use one of the original equations to solve for \\( a \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nUse the fifth term equation:\n\n\\[\na r^4 = 11\n\\]\n\nWe know \\( r^4 \\), so first, let's calculate \\( r^4 \\) from \\( r^6 = \\frac{5}{11} \\):\n\n\\[\nr^6 = \\frac{5}{11} \\implies r^4 = r^6 \\cdot r^{-2} = \\frac{5}{11} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{1} = \\frac{5}{11} \\cdot \\frac{11}{5} = 1\\]\nWait, that seems off. \n\nAlternative Approach:\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let\u2019s backtrack. Maybe calculating \\( r^4 \\) directly from \\( r^6 \\) isn't straightforward. \n- Instead, let's multiply both sides of \\( r^6 = \\frac{5}{11} \\) by \\( r^{-2} \\) to find \\( r^4 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nr^4 = r^6 \\cdot r^{-2} = \\frac{5}{11} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{1} = \\frac{5}{11} \\cdot \\frac{11}{5} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because if \\( r^4 = 1 \\), then \\( r^6 = r^4 \\cdot r^2 = 1 \\cdot r^2 \\), but \\( r^6 = \\frac{5}{11} \\). So, my previous calculation must be incorrect.\n\n**Mistake Identified:**\n\nI mistakenly assumed \\( r^4 = 1 \\). Let\u2019s revisit the calculation:\n\nGiven \\( r^6 = \\frac{5}{11} \\), to find \\( r^4 \\):\n\n\\[\nr^4 = \\sqrt{r^6 \\cdot r^{-2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{11} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{1}} \n\\]\n\nWait, taking square roots here might complicate things. Let me think differently.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nIt\u2019s probably easier to solve for \\( a \\) directly using the given information.\n\nLet\u2019s return to the fifth term equation:\n\n\\[\na r^4 = 11\n\\]\n\nFrom step 2, we have \\( r = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{1/6} \\). Let\u2019s calculate \\( r^4 \\) as \\( r^2 \\) squared.\n\nSo, first find \\( r^2 = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{1/3} \\), and then square it to get \\( r^4 \\).\n\nCalculations:\n\n\\[\nr^2 = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\\[\nr^4 = \\left( r^2 \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{2/3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet's verify if this makes sense.\n\n\\[\nr^4 = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{2/3}\n\\]\n\nI think this is correct because squaring the cube root exponent yields the fourth root exponent.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\( a \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that we have \\( r^4 = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{2/3} \\), we can substitute this back into the fifth term equation to solve for \\( a \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\na r^4 = 11 \\implies a \\cdot \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{2/3} = 11\n\\]\n\\[\na = 11 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{2/3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems correct because we\u2019re isolating \\( a \\) by dividing both sides by \\( r^4 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Eighth Term \\( a r^7 \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- We need to compute the eighth term, which is \\( a r^7 \\).\n- We already have \\( a = 11 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{2/3} \\) and \\( r = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{1/6} \\).\n- So, \\( r^7 = r^6 \\cdot r = \\frac{5}{11} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{1/6} = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6} \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\na r^7 = \\left( 11 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{2/3} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6}\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify this step by step.\n\n1. **Express \\( a r^7 \\) in Terms of Exponents:**\n\n   \\[\n   a r^7 = 11 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{2/3} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Combine the Exponents:**\n\n   When multiplying terms with the same base, we add the exponents.\n\n   - For base \\( \\frac{11}{5} \\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{2/3} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{7/6} = \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{2/3 + 7/6}\n     \\]\n\n     To add the exponents, find a common denominator:\n\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{6}, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad \\frac{4}{6} + \\frac{7}{6} = \\frac{11}{6}\n     \\]\n\n     Therefore:\n\n     \\[\n     \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{11/6}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Expression:**\n\n   So, now our expression for the eighth term is:\n\n   \\[\n   a r^7 = 11 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{11/6}\n   \\]\n\n   However, this expression seems a bit messy. Let\u2019s see if we can simplify it further.\n\n**Alternative Simplification Approach:**\n\nGiven that \\( r^7 = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6} \\), perhaps we can express everything in terms of \\( \\sqrt[6]{\\frac{5}{11}} \\).\n\nLet\u2019s redefine:\n\n\\[\nx = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{1/6}\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\nr = x\n\\]\n\\[\nr^4 = x^4 = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{2/3}\n\\]\n\\[\nr^6 = x^6 = \\frac{5}{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nr^7 = x^7 = x^6 \\cdot x = \\frac{5}{11} \\cdot x = \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6}\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute back into the expression for the eighth term:\n\n\\[\na r^7 = 11 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{2/3} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6}\n\\]\n\nBut I think using \\( x \\) might complicate things. Let's stick to the original expression and simplify.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Simplify the Eighth Term Expression\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- We need to simplify \\( 11 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{2/3} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6} \\).\n- It might be helpful to express everything in terms of square roots or cube roots to bring it to the simplest radical form.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet\u2019s separate the exponents and see if we can combine them differently.\n\n1. **Rewrite the Terms:**\n\n   \\[\n   a r^7 = 11 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{2/3} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6}\n   \\]\n\n   Can we rewrite \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6} \\) in terms of \\( \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{7/6} \\)?\n\n   Recall that:\n\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6} = \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{-7/6}\n   \\]\n\n   But introducing negative exponents might complicate things. Instead, let's see if we can combine the existing exponents.\n\n2. **Express in Square Roots:**\n\n   To bring it to the simplest radical form, perhaps expressing exponents as square or cube roots would help.\n\n   Let's re-express the exponents:\n\n   - \\( \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{2/3} = \\left( \\frac{11^2}{5^2} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{121}{25} \\right)^{1/3} \\)\n   - \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6} = \\left( \\frac{5^7}{11^7} \\right)^{1/6} \\)\n\n   Now, combine them:\n\n   \\[\n   a r^7 = 11 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{121}{25} \\right)^{1/3} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{5^7}{11^7} \\right)^{1/6}\n   \\]\n\n   This still looks complicated.\n\n**Alternative Simplification Idea:**\n\nMaybe instead of separating the terms, we can directly look for patterns based on geometric sequences known values.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Fifth term: \\( a r^4 = 11 \\)\n- Eleventh term: \\( a r^{10} = 5 \\)\n\nWe\u2019re looking for the eighth term, \\( a r^7 \\).\n\nNotice the indices:\n\n- Eighth term is between the fifth and eleventh terms.\n\n- The common ratio affects the terms exponentially based on their indices.\n\nThis suggests that the eighth term might be a geometric mean of the fifth and eleventh terms, but adjusted for the specific sequence.\n\nBut I need to confirm this pattern.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, thinking about it, I don\u2019t recall this specific pattern directly. Maybe there's a more straightforward approach.\n\nLet\u2019s see if integrating the exponents differently could help.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Alternative Approach Using Logarithms\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Maybe using logarithms could help solve for \\( r \\) more straightforwardly.\n- If \\( r^6 = \\frac{5}{11} \\), then taking logarithms might simplify finding \\( r \\).\n- However, logarithms can sometimes complicate things, especially since we\u2019re dealing with roots already.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI\u2019m unsure if this would make the problem easier. Given that we\u2019ve already made progress with exponents, I think it\u2019s better to continue with that approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Final Simplification of the Eighth Term\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let\u2019s return to our expression and see if we can simplify it to radical form.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\na r^7 = 11 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{2/3} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6}\n\\]\n\nExpress exponents as radicals:\n\n1. **Rewrite Exponents in Radical Form:**\n\n   - \\( \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^{2/3} = \\sqrt[3]{\\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{121}{25}} \\)\n   - \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^{7/6} = \\sqrt[6]{\\left( \\frac{5}{11} \\right)^7} = \\sqrt[6]{\\frac{5^7}{11^7}} \\)\n\n2. **Simplify Radical Expressions:**\n\n   - \\( \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{121}{25}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{121}}{\\sqrt[3]{25}} = \\frac{11^{2/3}}{5^{2/3}} \\)\n   - \\( \\sqrt[6]{\\frac{5^7}{11^7}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[6]{5^7}}{\\sqrt[6]{11^7}} = \\frac{5^{7/6}}{11^{7/6}} \\)\n\n3. **Combine the Radicals:**\n\n   \\[\n   a r^7 = 11 \\cdot \\frac{11^{2/3}}{5^{2/3}} \\cdot \\frac{5^{7/6}}{11^{7/6}}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplify step by step:\n\n   - Combine \\( 11^{2/3} \\) and \\( 11^{-7/6} \\):\n\n     \\[\n     11^{2/3 - 7/6} = 11^{4/6 - 7/6} = 11^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{11}}\n     \\]\n\n   - Combine \\( 5^{7/6} \\) and \\( 5^{-2/3} \\):\n\n     \\[\n     5^{7/6 - 2/3} = 5^{7/6 - 4/6} = 5^{3/6} = 5^{1/2} = \\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n\n   - Multiply by 11:\n\n     \\[\n     a r^7 = 11 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}} = 11 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{11}} = 11 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}} = \\frac{11 \\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}}\n     \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, does this look correct? Let me double-check the exponent simplifications.\n\n- **Exponent Check:**\n\n   - \\( 11^{2/3} \\cdot 11^{-7/6} = 11^{2/3 - 7/6} = 11^{4/6 - 7/6} = 11^{-1/2} \\)\n\n   - \\( 5^{7/6} \\cdot 5^{-2/3} = 5^{3/6} = 5^{1/2} \\)\n\n   Yes, the exponents simplify correctly.\n\n**Final Simplification:**\n\n\\[\na r^7 = \\frac{11 \\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}} = \\frac{11 \\cdot \\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}}\n\\]\n\nBut to express in simplest radical form, let's rationalize the denominator:\n\n\\[\na r^7 = \\frac{11 \\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{11}}{\\sqrt{11}} = \\frac{11 \\cdot \\sqrt{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{11}}{11} = \\sqrt{55}\n\\]\n\nWait, but I've previously calculated the eighth term as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11 \\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}} = \\frac{11 \\cdot \\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}} = \\frac{11 \\sqrt{55}}{11} = \\sqrt{55}\n\\]\n\nBut earlier, I reached \\( \\frac{11 \\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}} = \\frac{11 \\cdot \\sqrt{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{11}}{11} = \\sqrt{55} \\).\n\n**Consistency Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s see if both calculations lead to the same result.\n\n1. **First Simplification:**\n\n   \\[\n   a r^7 = \\frac{11 \\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}} = \\frac{11 \\cdot \\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}} = \\sqrt{55}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Simplification:**\n\n   \\[\n   a r^7 = \\frac{11 \\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{11}}{\\sqrt{11}} = \\frac{11 \\cdot \\sqrt{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{11}}{11} = \\sqrt{55}\n   \\]\n\nBoth approaches lead to the same final result:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Eighth Term} = \\sqrt{55}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Final Answer\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- After simplifying the expression carefully and checking the exponent calculations, it's clear that the eighth term simplifies to \\( \\sqrt{55} \\).\n- This matches our earlier calculation, confirming the consistency of the result.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{55}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Reflection:\n\nLet's take a moment to reflect on the entire process:\n\n1. **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n   - Initially, I considered expressing the terms in terms of the common ratio and the first term, which led me to set up equations based on the given terms.\n\n2. **Identifying and Correcting Mistakes:**\n\n   - At one point, I mistakenly concluded that \\( r^4 = 1 \\), which was incorrect. By revisiting the calculations and ensuring correct exponent handling, I corrected this.\n\n3. **Simplification Steps:**\n\n   - Throughout the simplification process, carefully managing exponents and converting between radical and exponential forms was crucial.\n   - Consistent checking ensured that each step led logically to the next.\n\n4. **Consistency Check:**\n\n   - By verifying that different approaches led to the same result, I confirmed the correctness of the final answer.\n\n5. **Final Answer Verification:**\n\n   - Multiple simplification paths converging to \\( \\sqrt{55} \\) reassured that the eighth term is indeed \\( \\sqrt{55} \\).\n\nOverall, brainstorming different strategies, being vigilant about potential mistakes, and consistently checking work led to a correct and verified solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $r$ be the common ratio of the geometric sequence. Then, the eighth term of the sequence is equal to $11r^3$, and the eleventh term of the sequence is equal to $11r^6 = 5$.
