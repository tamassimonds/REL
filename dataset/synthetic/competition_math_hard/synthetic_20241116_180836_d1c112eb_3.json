    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm a variety of strategies, reflect frequently, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's see where this journey takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, it mentions that a polynomial \\( p(x) \\) leaves specific remainders when divided by linear factors. This immediately reminds me of the **Remainder Theorem** and possibly **polynomial interpolation**. The fact that we're looking for the remainder when \\( p(x) \\) is divided by a product of these linear factors suggests that the remainder should be a polynomial of degree less than the divisor. \n\nBut wait, I'm also reminded of **Lagrange Interpolation** or **Newton's Divided Difference** which are methods used to find polynomials passing through given points. Maybe I could set up a system of equations based on the given remainders.\n\nAnother angle is using **modular arithmetic** principles to handle the remainders, but that feels a bit cumbersome for polynomials. \n\nHmm, I think starting with setting up equations based on the Remainder Theorem might be a good starting point. If that doesn\u2019t pan out, I can look into interpolation methods. Let\u2019s give it a shot.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Remainders and Applying the Remainder Theorem**\n\nAccording to the **Remainder Theorem**, when a polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is divided by \\( x - a \\), the remainder is \\( p(a) \\).\n\nGiven:\n\n1. \\( p(1) = -1 \\)\n2. \\( p(2) = 3 \\)\n3. \\( p(-3) = 4 \\)\n\nThese points can be thought of as conditions that \\( p(x) \\) must satisfy. \n\nMy first thought is to use these conditions to construct \\( p(x) \\), but since there are three points and we're dealing with the remainder when divided by a cubic polynomial \\((x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 3)\\), I realize that \\( p(x) \\) must be of at least cubic degree. \n\nWait, do I need to find the exact polynomial \\( p(x) \\)? The question only asks for \\( r(6) \\), the remainder when \\( p(x) \\) is divided by the cubic polynomial. That suggests I might not need the full form of \\( p(x) \\), just enough to determine \\( r(6) \\).\n\nReflecting on this, I think it might be beneficial to consider \\( r(x) \\) as a polynomial that interpolates the given points. But before jumping into interpolation, let me explore if there's a more straightforward approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering Remainders and Polynomial Degrees**\n\nLet\u2019s suppose \\( p(x) \\) is divided by \\((x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 3)\\), which is a cubic polynomial, and the remainder \\( r(x) \\) is of degree less than 3. Therefore, \\( r(x) \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nr(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) are constants to be determined.\n\nBut wait, I already have three conditions \\( p(1) = -1 \\), \\( p(2) = 3 \\), and \\( p(-3) = 4 \\). Since the remainder \\( r(x) \\) must satisfy these same conditions, I can directly substitute these values into \\( r(x) \\) to set up a system of equations.\n\nI think this approach makes sense. Let's proceed with it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up the System of Equations**\n\nSubstituting the given points into \\( r(x) \\):\n\n1. For \\( x = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   A(1)^2 + B(1) + C = -1 \\implies A + B + C = -1 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. For \\( x = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   A(2)^2 + B(2) + C = 3 \\implies 4A + 2B + C = 3 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. For \\( x = -3 \\):\n   \\[\n   A(-3)^2 + B(-3) + C = 4 \\implies 9A - 3B + C = 4 \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n   \\]\n\nNow I've got a system of three linear equations with three unknowns. \n\nThinking ahead, I can solve this system using **substitution**, **elimination**, or **matrix methods**. Since the numbers aren't too messy, I might stick with elimination for simplicity. \n\nBut reflecting for a moment, maybe using matrices could streamline the process, especially if I'm prone to making arithmetic mistakes. Let\u2019s try solving it step by step to see which method feels more natural.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the System Using Elimination**\n\nLet\u2019s try elimination:\n\nFirst, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\n(4A + 2B + C) - (A + B + C) = 3 - (-1)\n\\]\n\\[\n3A + B = 4 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)}\n\\]\n\nNext, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3 to eliminate \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\n(9A - 3B + C) - (A + B + C) = 4 - (-1)\n\\]\n\\[\n8A - 4B = 5 \\quad \\text{(Equation 5)}\n\\]\n\nNow, I have a simpler system:\n\n1. \\( 3A + B = 4 \\)  (Equation 4)\n2. \\( 8A - 4B = 5 \\)  (Equation 5)\n\nLet\u2019s multiply Equation 4 by 4 to align the coefficients of \\( B \\):\n\n\\[\n12A + 4B = 16 \\quad \\text{(Equation 6)}\n\\]\n\nNow, add Equation 5 to Equation 6 to eliminate \\( B \\):\n\n\\[\n(12A + 4B) + (8A - 4B) = 16 + 5\n\\]\n\\[\n20A = 21 \\implies A = \\frac{21}{20} = 1.05\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, does \\( A = 1.05 \\) seem reasonable? Let's reflect. \n\nThe value is slightly greater than 1, which might be plausible depending on the other coefficients. Since we're working with fractions, it's possible that the arithmetic is correct but the fraction simplified. Let me continue to see if the other coefficients make sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving for \\( B \\) and \\( C \\)**\n\nNow that I have \\( A = 1.05 \\), let's substitute back into Equation 4 to find \\( B \\):\n\n\\[\n3(1.05) + B = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n3.15 + B = 4 \\implies B = 4 - 3.15 = 0.85\n\\]\n\nNext, substitute \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) into Equation 1 to find \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\n1.05 + 0.85 + C = -1\n\\]\n\\[\n1.90 + C = -1 \\implies C = -1 - 1.90 = -2.90 = -2.9\n\\]\n\nAlright, now I have:\n\n\\[\nA = 1.05, \\quad B = 0.85, \\quad C = -2.9\n\\]\n\nLet me quickly check these values by substituting back into the original equations:\n\n- **Check Equation 1**: \n  \\[\n  1.05 + 0.85 - 2.9 = -1 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check Equation 2**: \n  \\[\n  4(1.05) + 2(0.85) - 2.9 = 3 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check Equation 3**: \n  \\[\n  9(1.05) - 3(0.85) - 2.9 = 4 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n  \\]\n\nEverything checks out. \n\nBut let me pause for a moment\u2014does it make sense for the coefficients to be fractions? Given the remainders were integers, I might expect \\( r(x) \\) to have integer coefficients unless there's an error in the setup.\n\nReflecting on this, perhaps re-examining the initial approach is necessary. Maybe there's a simpler way or an oversight. \n\nBut since all checks align, I'll proceed with these coefficients.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Writing the Remainder Polynomial**\n\nWith \\( A = 1.05 \\), \\( B = 0.85 \\), and \\( C = -2.9 \\), the remainder polynomial is:\n\n\\[\nr(x) = 1.05x^2 + 0.85x - 2.9\n\\]\n\nHmm, let me reflect again. The coefficients are fractions, but they add up correctly when checked. Perhaps simplifying them could make calculations easier, especially since we're evaluating at \\( x = 6 \\).\n\nBut considering the request is for \\( r(6) \\), let's proceed with these coefficients and calculate \\( r(6) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Calculating \\( r(6) \\)**\n\nNow, let's substitute \\( x = 6 \\) into \\( r(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nr(6) = 1.05(6)^2 + 0.85(6) - 2.9\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1.05(36) + 5.1 - 2.9\n\\]\n\\[\n= 37.8 + 5.1 - 2.9\n\\]\n\\[\n= 40.0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( r(6) = 40 \\).\n\nHmm, let me reflect. Does this value seem reasonable? Given the remainders were relatively small integers, a result like 40 might feel large, but since we're dealing with a polynomial of degree 2, it's plausible.\n\nNonetheless, I should double-check the arithmetic to ensure there's no mistake.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Verifying the Calculation**\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 1.05(6)^2 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   1.05 \\times 36 = 37.8 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate \\( 0.85(6) \\)**:\n   \\[\n   0.85 \\times 6 = 5.1 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Add and subtract \\( -2.9 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   37.8 + 5.1 - 2.9 = 40.0 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n   \\]\n\nEverything checks out. The arithmetic is correct, and the value \\( r(6) = 40 \\) appears consistent with the polynomial's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nInitially, I considered different strategies, including polynomial interpolation, which might have been a quicker path. However, by setting up and solving a system of equations based on the Remainder Theorem, I arrived at a consistent solution.\n\nThroughout the process, checking each step ensured that the calculations were correct, even though the fractional coefficients seemed unusual at first. This careful approach led to the accurate result of \\( r(6) = 40 \\).\n\nIn hindsight, starting with interpolation could have streamlined the process, but methodically solving the system provided confidence in the accuracy of the result.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring various strategies and meticulously checking each calculation, the remainder when \\( p(6) \\) is divided by \\((x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 3)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]\n\nThis reflection shows that while multiple approaches exist, carefully following through with the chosen method, verifying each step, and being open to adjusting the strategy leads to a reliable solution.",
