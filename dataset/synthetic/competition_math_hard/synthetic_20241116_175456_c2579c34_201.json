    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. I'll mimic my natural thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting, checking my work, and being open to changing approaches as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the function\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{\\sin^3 x + 6 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x + 2 \\cos^2 x - 8}{\\sin x - 1},\n\\]\n\nI think, *This looks like a trigonometric function involving sine and cosine, similar to problems I've encountered before.* My initial reaction is to simplify the expression, but I'm unsure how to proceed because \\(\\sin x \\neq 1\\) is specified. That restriction is important and hints that maybe factoring or simplifying the denominator could help.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Factor the numerator:** Maybe the numerator can be factored so that the denominator cancels out.\n2. **Use trigonometric identities:** Since \\(\\cos^2 x = 1 - \\sin^2 x\\), perhaps substituting that could simplify things.\n3. **Limit approach:** Considering the limit as \\(\\sin x\\) approaches 1 might give insights since the denominator goes to zero there.\n4. **Graphical Analysis:** Plotting the function to visually identify the range could provide hints, but I should aim for an algebraic solution first.\n\nI'm leaning towards factoring the numerator, but let's explore these options step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Factor the Numerator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf I can factor the numerator such that \\(\\sin x - 1\\) is a factor, then the expression might simplify, and I could easily find the range by canceling the denominator.\n\n**Action:**\n\nLet's start by rewriting the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + 6 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x + 2 \\cos^2 x - 8\n\\]\n\nRecall that \\(\\cos^2 x = 1 - \\sin^2 x\\). Substituting that in:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + 6 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x + 2(1 - \\sin^2 x) - 8\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + 6 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x + 2 - 2 \\sin^2 x - 8\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + (6 \\sin^2 x - 2 \\sin^2 x) + \\sin x + (2 - 8)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + 4 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*Hmm, this looks cleaner. Maybe I can factor it now.* Let's see if \\(\\sin x - 1\\) is a factor by using synthetic division or polynomial division.\n\n**Check:**\n\nSet \\(\\sin x = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n1^3 + 4(1^2) + 1 - 6 = 1 + 4 + 1 - 6 = 0\n\\]\n\nSince the numerator equals zero when \\(\\sin x = 1\\), \\(\\sin x - 1\\) is indeed a factor.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*Okay, this seems promising. I can factor the numerator as \\((\\sin x - 1)(\\text{something})\\).*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Factoring the Numerator Completely**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I know \\(\\sin x - 1\\) is a factor, I can divide the numerator by \\(\\sin x - 1\\) to find the other factor.\n\n**Action:**\n\nLet's perform polynomial long division or synthetic division to factor out \\(\\sin x - 1\\) from \\(\\sin^3 x + 4 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 6\\).\n\n**Polynomial Long Division:**\n\nDivide \\(\\sin^3 x + 4 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 6\\) by \\(\\sin x - 1\\).\n\n1. Divide the leading terms: \\(\\frac{\\sin^3 x}{\\sin x} = \\sin^2 x\\).\n2. Multiply \\(\\sin^2 x\\) by the divisor: \\(\\sin^2 x (\\sin x - 1) = \\sin^3 x - \\sin^2 x\\).\n3. Subtract this from the original polynomial:\n\n\\[\n(\\sin^3 x + 4 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 6) - (\\sin^3 x - \\sin^2 x) = 5 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 6\n\\]\n\n4. Divide the leading term of the remainder: \\(\\frac{5 \\sin^2 x}{\\sin x} = 5 \\sin x\\).\n5. Multiply \\(5 \\sin x\\) by the divisor: \\(5 \\sin x (\\sin x - 1) = 5 \\sin^2 x - 5 \\sin x\\).\n6. Subtract:\n\n\\[\n(5 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 6) - (5 \\sin^2 x - 5 \\sin x) = 6 \\sin x - 6\n\\]\n\n7. Divide the leading term of the remainder: \\(\\frac{6 \\sin x}{\\sin x} = 6\\).\n8. Multiply \\(6\\) by the divisor: \\(6 (\\sin x - 1) = 6 \\sin x - 6\\).\n9. Subtract:\n\n\\[\n(6 \\sin x - 6) - (6 \\sin x - 6) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\n\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + 4 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 6 = (\\sin x - 1)(\\sin^2 x + 5 \\sin x + 6)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*Wait a minute, this looks like a quadratic in \\(\\sin x\\). Let me check if it can be factored further.*\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs \\(\\sin^2 x + 5 \\sin x + 6\\) factorable?\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\(6\\) (the constant term) and add up to \\(5\\) (the coefficient of \\(\\sin x\\)).\n\nBut \\(6\\) and \\(5\\) don\u2019t multiply to \\(6\\), and the quadratic doesn't seem to factor nicely.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*Hmm, this quadratic doesn't factor neatly. Maybe it's irreducible over the reals. Let's proceed with this factorization and see where it leads.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Function**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I've factored the numerator, I can simplify the function by canceling the common factor in the numerator and the denominator.\n\n**Action:**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{(\\sin x - 1)(\\sin^2 x + 5 \\sin x + 6)}{\\sin x - 1}, \\quad \\sin x \\neq 1\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sin x - 1\\) is a common factor and \\(\\sin x \\neq 1\\), I can cancel it:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sin^2 x + 5 \\sin x + 6 \\quad \\text{for } \\sin x \\neq 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*Alright, this looks much simpler. Now I have a quadratic in terms of \\(\\sin x\\). I can analyze its range by considering the possible values of \\(\\sin x\\), which are between -1 and 1.*\n\n**Check:**\n\n*But wait, since \\(\\sin x \\neq 1\\), I need to ensure that the point where \\(\\sin x = 1\\) doesn\u2019t affect the range.*\n\nThe original function is undefined at \\(\\sin x = 1\\), but since I've canceled \\(\\sin x - 1\\), the simplified function is valid for all \\(\\sin x\\) values except \\(\\sin x = 1\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*Looks good. Now I just need to find the range of the quadratic function within the bounds of \\(\\sin x\\) being -1 to 1, excluding \\(\\sin x = 1\\).*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Analyzing the Quadratic Function**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the range of \\(f(x) = \\sin^2 x + 5 \\sin x + 6\\), I need to analyze the quadratic behavior within the interval \\([-1, 1]\\), excluding the endpoint at \\(\\sin x = 1\\).\n\n**Action:**\n\n1. **Identify Vertex:** The vertex of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) gives the maximum or minimum value, depending on the orientation (concave up or down).\n\n   Here, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 5\\), and \\(c = 6\\), so:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Vertex} = \\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}, f\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{5}{2}, f\\left(-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\right)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Check the Value at the Vertex:**\n\n   However, \\(-\\frac{5}{2} = -2.5\\) is outside the interval \\([-1, 1]\\), so I need to evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\n3. **Calculate \\(f(x)\\) at the Endpoints:**\n\n   - **At \\(\\sin x = -1\\):**\n\n     \\[\n     f(-1) = (-1)^2 + 5(-1) + 6 = 1 - 5 + 6 = 2\n     \\]\n\n   - **At \\(\\sin x = 1\\):**\n\n     \\[\n     f(1) = (1)^2 + 5(1) + 6 = 1 + 5 + 6 = 12\n     \\]\n\n     *But since \\(\\sin x = 1\\) is not included in the range, we can't consider this value.*\n\n4. **Check for Minimum Inside the Interval:**\n\n   Since the vertex is at \\(-2.5\\), which is outside the interval, and the parabola opens upwards (because \\(a > 0\\)), the minimum value within \\([-1, 1]\\) is at \\(\\sin x = -1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*So, the minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(2\\) at \\(\\sin x = -1\\), and the maximum value approaches \\(12\\) as \\(\\sin x\\) approaches \\(1\\), but \\(12\\) is not included because \\(\\sin x = 1\\) is excluded.*\n\n**Check:**\n\n*Let me quickly verify:*\n\n- Minimum at \\(\\sin x = -1\\): \\(2\\)\n- Maximum as \\(\\sin x\\) approaches \\(1\\): \\(12\\)\n\n*This seems consistent. However, we should confirm that there's no other point within \\([-1, 1]\\) that provides a higher value.*\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*Given that the parabola opens upwards and the vertex is outside the interval, the maximum value within the interval approaches \\(12\\), and the minimum value is \\(2\\). Thus, the range is \\([2, 12)\\), excluding \\(12\\) because \\(\\sin x\\) never actually reaches \\(1\\).*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finalizing the Range**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the range of the function \\(f(x) = \\sin^2 x + 5 \\sin x + 6\\) is from \\(2\\) to \\(12\\), including \\(2\\) but not including \\(12\\).\n\n**Action:**\n\nWrite the range in interval notation:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{[2, 12)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*Wait, did I miss anything? Let me double-check:*\n\n- The minimum value is at \\(\\sin x = -1\\): \\(f(-1) = 2\\)\n- The maximum value approaches \\(12\\) as \\(\\sin x\\) approaches \\(1\\), but since \\(\\sin x = 1\\) is not included, \\(12\\) is not part of the range.\n\n*Everything checks out. The range is correctly identified as \\([2, 12)\\).*\n\n**Check:**\n\n*Final quick check:*\n\n- At \\(\\sin x = -1\\): \\(f(-1) = 2\\)\n- As \\(\\sin x\\) approaches \\(1\\): \\(f(x)\\) approaches \\(12\\), but \\(x\\) never actually reaches \\(\\sin x = 1\\).\n\n*The range is consistent with the behavior of the quadratic function.*\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*The range of the function is indeed \\([2, 12)\\).*\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n*Initially, I wasn't sure how to handle the trigonometric aspects of the problem, but recognizing that factoring the numerator was key helped me simplify the expression. By carefully analyzing the quadratic function that emerged, I was able to determine the range through vertex analysis and endpoint evaluations.*\n\n*Reflecting throughout the process ensured that each step logically followed the previous one, and checking the work at each stage confirmed the accuracy of the final result.*\n\n*Overall, approaching the problem methodically, being open to changing strategies, and consistently verifying each step led to successfully finding the range of the function.*\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed, step-by-step exploration mirrors a human's thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflections, checks, and finalizations. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!",
