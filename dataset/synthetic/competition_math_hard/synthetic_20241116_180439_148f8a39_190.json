    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I want to brainstorm, reflect, and check my work along the way to make sure I'm on the right track. Let's start by really understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- The problem asks for the probability that a randomly chosen five-digit integer has its units digit (the last digit) less than 5.\n- We're dealing with five-digit integers, so the range is from 10,000 to 99,999.\n- Probability generally involves finding the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Strategy 1:** Count the total number of five-digit integers and the number of those with a units digit less than 5. Then, find the probability as the ratio of these two numbers.\n- **Strategy 2:** Consider the probability of the units digit being 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 separately and sum these probabilities.\n- **Strategy 3:** Use complementary probability\u2014find the probability that the units digit is 5 or greater and subtract from 1.\n\nI think Strategy 1 makes the most sense because it directly addresses the question by counting favorable versus total outcomes. But let's keep Strategy 3 in mind as a possible check.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Total Number of Five-Digit Integers**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- All five-digit numbers range from 10,000 to 99,999.\n- To find the total number of five-digit integers, I can calculate the difference between the largest and smallest five-digit numbers and add one (since both endpoints are inclusive).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n99,999 - 10,000 + 1 = 89,999 + 1 = 90,000\n\\]\nSo, there are **90,000** total five-digit integers.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- That seems correct because subtracting the smallest from the largest gives the range, and adding one accounts for inclusivity.\n- **Quick Check:** 99,999 minus 10,000 is 89,999, and adding one makes it 90,000. This aligns with what I expect.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining Favorable Outcomes\u2014Units Digit Less Than 5**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- The units digit can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n- I'm interested in the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n- **Strategy 1:** For each five-digit number, if the units digit is one of these, it's a favorable outcome.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Since each five-digit number has its digits independently chosen (except the first digit can't be zero), I can calculate the number of five-digit integers with units digits less than 5.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- For the first digit: Can be 1 to 9 \u2192 **9 options**\n- For the second digit: Can be 0 to 9 \u2192 **10 options**\n- For the third digit: Can be 0 to 9 \u2192 **10 options**\n- For the fourth digit: Can be 0 to 9 \u2192 **10 options**\n- For the fifth digit (units digit): Must be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 \u2192 **5 options**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Favorable Outcomes} = 9 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 5 = 450,000\n\\]\nWait a second! That can't be right because the number of favorable outcomes (450,000) exceeds the total number of possible five-digit integers (90,000). I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Realization:** My calculation assumes that each position in the five-digit number contributes independently, but that leads to an impossible total. This suggests that I've double-counted or miscalculated the sample space.\n- **Mistake Checking:** I didn't consider that the total sample space is fixed at 90,000, so my method of multiplying options wouldn't work here.\n- **Adjustment Needed:** I need a different approach to align the favorable outcomes with the correct sample space.\n\n**New Approach:**\n- Instead of multiplying options directly, I should consider the proportion of five-digit numbers with units digits less than 5 relative to the total number of five-digit integers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Each Position's Contribution Separately**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Perhaps I can calculate the probability for the units digit independently and then apply it to the total number of five-digit integers.\n- **Strategy 2:** Consider that the units digit has equal probability across 0-9, and six out of ten digits (0-5) are less than 5.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Probability that the units digit is less than 5:\n\\[\nP(\\text{units digit} < 5) = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n- Since each five-digit number has an equal chance of having any digit in the units place, this probability applies to all 90,000 five-digit integers.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Favorable Outcomes} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 90,000 = 45,000\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Comparison:** This approach makes more sense because 45,000 is a feasible number of favorable outcomes within the total sample space of 90,000.\n- **Check:** Half of 90,000 is 45,000, which aligns with the proportion of units digits being less than 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Probability**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Now, I need to calculate the probability based on the favorable and total outcomes.\n- Probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Favorable Outcomes}}{\\text{Total Outcomes}} = \\frac{45,000}{90,000} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Final Check:** The probability simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), which seems reasonable.\n- **Intuition:** Since there are five possible digits (0-4) out of ten total digits less than 5, it makes sense that the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Alternative Strategy\u2014Using Complementary Probability**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- To verify my answer, I'll use Strategy 3: complementary probability.\n- Instead of directly calculating the probability of the units digit being less than 5, I'll calculate the probability of it being 5 or greater and subtract from 1.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Probability that the units digit is 5 or greater:\n\\[\nP(\\text{units digit} \\geq 5) = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n- Therefore, probability that the units digit is less than 5:\n\\[\nP(\\text{units digit} < 5) = 1 - P(\\text{units digit} \\geq 5) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Consistency Check:** Both strategies yield the same probability\u2014\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n- **Conclusion:** This confirms that the probability is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Initially, I tried counting the total number of favorable outcomes by considering each digit's possible values, which led to a discrepancy.\n- **Adjusting Strategy:** Realizing the total sample space was fixed, I shifted to calculating the probability based on the units digit's possible values.\n- **Checking Work:** Using complementary probability confirmed the correctness of the probability.\n- **Final Answer:** The probability that the units digit of a randomly chosen five-digit integer is less than 5 is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThrough this step-by-step process, including brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies, I've arrived at the correct probability.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the choice of all the first four digits has no bearing on what the units digit is, we consider only what the units digit is. Since the last digit is less than 5, it can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. And there are 10 digits to choose from in total, so the probability is $\\frac{5}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
