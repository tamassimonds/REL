    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it for the first time. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their validity, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's see where this takes us.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question, it mentions Genevieve creating **small** and **large** kites, with the small one drawn on a grid with points one inch apart. There's also a visual representation with specific coordinates and a large kite that's a scaled version of the small one.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n- **Coordinate Geometry:**  I recall that finding the area of shapes on a grid often involves using the coordinates of the vertices. This reminds me of calculating areas for polygons.\n- **Grid Method:** Maybe I could count the squares the kite occupies.\n- **Area Formula for Polygons:** Perhaps using a formula like the shoelace theorem could work here.\n\nBut wait, the question only asks for the **area of the small kite**, so the large kite details might be a distraction.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Using Coordinate Geometry:**  \n   - Plot the vertices and apply a formula to find the area.\n  \n2. **Shoelace Theorem:**  \n   - This is a specific method for finding the area of polygons given their vertices in the coordinate plane.\n\n3. **Grid Counting:**  \n   - Visualize or count how many grid squares the kite occupies, adjusting for partial squares.\n\nLet me start with **Coordinate Geometry** and see where it leads.\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying the Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLooking at the grid, I need to identify the coordinates of each vertex of the kite.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet's map out the vertices based on the given information.\n\n- Lower left corner: (3, 0)\n- Upper right corner: (3, 7)\n- Lower right corner: (6, 5)\n- Upper left corner: (0, 5)\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? The kite should be symmetric. Let me double-check:\n\n     (0,5)\n       \u2197\n         |\n       / \\\n      /   \\\n (3,0)----- (6,5)\n         \\\n           \u2198\n            (3,7)\n\nHmm, looking at this, the kite appears symmetric about the line x = 3. That seems reasonable.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI think I've got the coordinates right. Let's move forward.\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Shoelace Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe Shoelace Theorem is perfect for calculating the area of polygons when you have the coordinates of their vertices.\n\n**Formula:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum (x_iy_{i+1}) - \\sum (y_ix_{i+1}) \\right|\n\\]\nwhere the last vertex wraps around to the first.\n\n**Coordinates:**\n- (3, 0)\n- (6, 5)\n- (3, 7)\n- (0, 5)\n\nLet's set this up:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (3 \\times 5 + 6 \\times 7 + 3 \\times 5 + 0 \\times 0) - (0 \\times 6 + 5 \\times 3 + 7 \\times 0 + 5 \\times 3) \\right|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (15 + 42 + 15 + 0) - (0 + 15 + 0 + 15) \\right|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 72 - 30 \\right|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\times 42 = 21\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the area of the small kite is **21 square inches**. This seems to align with expectations based on the coordinates provided.\n\n### **Step 3: Checking the Work**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt's always good to double-check calculations, especially with stepwise methods like the Shoelace Theorem.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- Did I list the coordinates correctly?\n- Are the multiplication and addition correct?\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLooking back, the coordinates were mapped correctly, and the arithmetic steps seem accurate. The area calculation flows logically.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nJust to be thorough, let's consider the **grid counting method**.\n\n### **Step 4: Using the Grid Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nCounting the grid squares can provide a visual confirmation of the area.\n\n**Grid Setup:**  \nEach square is 1 inch by 1 inch. The kite should fit within these squares, overlapping them partially.\n\n**Counting Partial Squares:**  \n- The kite spans from x = 0 to x = 6 and y = 0 to y = 7.\n- However, since it's a kite (a square rotated 45 degrees), not all grid squares are fully covered.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis method seems less precise for a kite shape because of overlapping partial squares, especially with uneven coverage.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this method yield the same area? It's hard to count accurately without precise visual aids, but intuitively, the Shoelace Theorem provides a clearer numerical answer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nAfter exploring different strategies, the **Shoelace Theorem** provided a straightforward and accurate calculation for the area of the small kite.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of square inches in the area of the small kite is **21 square inches**.\n\nBy brainstorming various methods, reflecting on each step, and checking the validity of my approach, I ensured a thorough and accurate solution to the problem.",
