    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I would when tackling it for the first time. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on whether each approach makes sense, and adjusting my path as needed. I'll aim to think out loud, noting any initial thoughts, uncertainties, and \"aha moments\" along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see this problem\u2014\"Let \\( f \\) be a linear function for which \\( f(6) - f(2) = 12 \\). What is \\( f(12) - f(2) \\)?\"\u2014a few things pop into my mind:\n\n1. **Linear Functions:** I recall that linear functions have a specific form, usually something like \\( f(x) = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept.\n\n2. **Difference of Function Values:** The expression \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) reminds me of how differences in inputs relate through the slope in linear functions.\n\n3. **Coordinate System Approach:** Maybe I can think of this in terms of points on a graph or coordinate differences.\n\nBut honestly, I feel a bit unsure because I'm not entirely sure if setting up an equation for \\( f(x) \\) is the most straightforward path. Let's explore different strategies to find the best one.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Express \\( f(x) \\) in Terms of \\( m \\) and \\( b \\):** Since \\( f(x) = mx + b \\), I could set up equations based on the given information.\n\n2. **Use the Slope Concept Directly:** Given that \\( f(6) - f(2) = 12 \\), maybe I can relate this to the slope \\( m \\) times the difference in x-values.\n\n3. **Look for Patterns or Proportionality:** Perhaps there's a pattern in the differences that can help me deduce the required value without fully determining \\( f(x) \\).\n\n4. **Check if Multiple Approaches Align:** After trying one method, I should check if the result makes sense; if not, try another.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Express \\( f(x) \\) in Terms of \\( m \\) and \\( b \\):**\n\nLet's start with the first strategy\u2014expressing \\( f(x) \\) in terms of \\( m \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n1. **Assume the Linear Function Form:**  \n   \\[\n   f(x) = mx + b\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Given Information:**  \n   The problem states:\n   \\[\n   f(6) - f(2) = 12\n   \\]\n   \n   Substitute \\( x = 6 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\) into the function:\n   \\[\n   (m \\cdot 6 + b) - (m \\cdot 2 + b) = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Equation:**  \n   Cancel out \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   6m + b - 2m - b = 12 \\\\\n   (6m - 2m) = 12 \\\\\n   4m = 12\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Solve for \\( m \\):**  \n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Reflection:**  \n   Okay, I've determined \\( m = 3 \\). Is this method working? It seems straightforward. But let's see if it aligns with other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Using the Slope Concept Directly:**\n\nNow, let's try the second strategy\u2014using the slope concept to see if it confirms our previous result.\n\n1. **Recall the Slope Definition:**  \n   The slope \\( m \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Apply the Given Information:**  \n   Here, \\( x_1 = 2 \\) and \\( x_2 = 6 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{f(6) - f(2)}{6 - 2} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Check Consistency:**  \n   This matches the \\( m \\) value we found earlier. That reassures me that the approach is correct.\n\n4. **Proceed to Find \\( f(12) - f(2) \\):**  \n   Now, I need to find \\( f(12) - f(2) \\). Using the slope:\n   \\[\n   f(12) - f(2) = m \\times (12 - 2) = 3 \\times 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n5. **Reflection:**  \n   This result makes sense. The slope of 3 indicates that for every unit increase in \\( x \\), \\( f(x) \\) increases by 3. Over a span of 10 units (\\( 12 - 2 \\)), the total increase is 30.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Checking the Answer with a Different Approach:**\n\nJust to be sure, let's attempt another method\u2014looking for patterns or proportionality.\n\n1. **Analyze the Given Difference:**  \n   The given difference is \\( f(6) - f(2) = 12 \\). This corresponds to an \\( x \\)-span of \\( 6 - 2 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Apply the Slope Concept Again:**  \n   We know the slope \\( m \\) is 3, so:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{f(6) - f(2)}{6 - 2} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Use the Slope to Find \\( f(12) - f(2) \\):**  \n   With \\( m = 3 \\) and the \\( x \\)-span from 2 to 12 being 10:\n   \\[\n   f(12) - f(2) = m \\times (12 - 2) = 3 \\times 10 = 30\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Final Reflection:**  \n   Both methods lead to the same result: \\( f(12) - f(2) = 30 \\). This consistency reassures me that the answer is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nIn tackling this problem, I explored multiple strategies\u2014expressing \\( f(x) \\) in terms of \\( m \\) and \\( b \\) and utilizing the slope concept directly. Both approaches led me to the same conclusion: \\( f(12) - f(2) = 30 \\).\n\nThroughout the process, I checked each step to ensure the methods aligned, reflecting and adjusting my approach as needed. This not only confirms the correctness of the solution but also reinforces the understanding of how linear functions work in relation to their slopes and differences in \\( x \\)-values.\n\nBy thinking aloud and considering alternative methods, I ensured a thorough and accurate solution, mirroring a human-like problem-solving journey with all its initial hesitations, reflections, and confirmations.",
