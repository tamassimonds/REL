    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. I\u2019m going to brainstorm different strategies, explore my thoughts, and make sure to reflect and check my work along the way \u2014 just like I would if tackling this manually.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Understanding the Question:** \n  A rectangle has semicircles drawn on each side, using the rectangle\u2019s sides as diameters. I need to find out what percent larger the area of the larger semicircles is compared to the smaller ones.\n\n- **First Reaction:**\n  - This reminds me of problems involving combined areas, especially with circles and rectangles.\n  - At first glance, it seems I need to compare the areas of semicircles of different sizes.\n  - I'm not entirely sure how to differentiate the larger and smaller semicircles just by looking at the rectangle\u2019s dimensions.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Area of All Semicircles:**\n   - Find the area of all four semicircles.\n   - Determine which are larger and which are smaller.\n   - Calculate the total area of each set and find the percentage difference.\n\n2. **Use Proportions of the Rectangle\u2019s Sides:**\n   - Since the rectangle has two sides of different lengths, maybe the semicircles on the longer sides are the larger ones.\n\n3. **Visual Representation:**\n   - Draw a diagram to visualize which semicircles are larger.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does the Strategy Make Sense?**\n  - The first strategy seems straightforward but might be tedious. \n  - The second strategy relies on correctly identifying which sides correspond to the larger semicircles.\n  - Drawing a diagram could help clarify things, but I\u2019m not entirely confident it\u2019ll resolve everything.\n\n**Choosing a Starting Point:**\n- I think starting by calculating the areas of the semicircles based on the rectangle\u2019s dimensions makes sense. If that gets complicated, I can switch strategies.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Radius of All Semicircles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Each semicircle has its diameter equal to the sides of the rectangle.\n- Therefore, the radius of each semicircle is half of the respective side.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Length of the Rectangles\u2019 Sides:**\n  - Width = 6 meters\n  - Height = 10 meters\n\n- **Radius of Semicircles:**\n  - Semicircles on the **Width** (6 meters side):\n    - Diameter = 6 meters \u2192 Radius = \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) meters\n  - Semicircles on the **Height** (10 meters side):\n    - Diameter = 10 meters \u2192 Radius = \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\) meters\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Checking the Work:**\n  - Does it make sense that the radius is half the side length? Yes, because the semicircle's diameter is the side length.\n\n- **Is There Ambiguity?**\n  - Initially, I considered whether both sides have semicircles, but the problem states there's one on each side, so this seems correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Area of Each Semicircle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The area of a semicircle is given by the formula \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 \\).\n- I\u2019ll calculate the area for both the larger and smaller semicircles.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Smaller Semicircles (Radius = 3 meters):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (3^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (9) = \\frac{9\\pi}{2} \\text{ square meters}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Larger Semicircles (Radius = 5 meters):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (5^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (25) = \\frac{25\\pi}{2} \\text{ square meters}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Checking the Formula:**\n  - \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 \\) makes sense for a semicircle. \n  - Did I square the radius correctly? Yes.\n\n- **Is the Calculation Correct?**\n  - Quick check: \n    - \\( 3^2 = 9 \\), \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n    - Multiplying by \\( \\pi \\) and halving works out.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Total Area of Each Set of Semicircles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- There are two semicircles of each size (since there are two lengths of each side).\n- Multiply the area of one semicircle by two to get the total for each set.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Total Area of Smaller Semicircles:**\n  \\[\n  2 \\times \\frac{9\\pi}{2} = 9\\pi \\text{ square meters}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Total Area of Larger Semicircles:**\n  \\[\n  2 \\times \\frac{25\\pi}{2} = 25\\pi \\text{ square meters}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does This Add Up?**\n  - Multiplying by 2 makes sense since there are two semicircles of each kind.\n  - The areas seem proportional to the squares of the radii, which is expected.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Percentage Difference in Areas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to find out what percent larger the area of the larger semicircles is compared to the smaller ones.\n- The formula for percentage difference is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Percentage Difference} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New} - \\text{Old}}{\\text{Old}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n  \\]\n- In this context, \"New\" is the area of the larger semicircles, and \"Old\" is the area of the smaller semicircles.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Difference in Area:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Difference} = 25\\pi - 9\\pi = 16\\pi \\text{ square meters}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Percentage Difference:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{16\\pi}{9\\pi} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{16}{9} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 177.78\\%\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Checking the Calculation:**\n  - When calculating \\( \\frac{16}{9} \\times 100 \\), I get approximately 177.78%.\n  - This seems reasonable given that the larger semicircles have radii \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\) times larger than the smaller ones, and area scales with the square of the radius.\n\n- **Does the Result Make Sense?**\n  - An increase of about 178% is significant, implying the larger semicircles occupy much more area, which aligns with their larger radius.\n\n### **Step 5: Express the Answer to the Nearest Whole Number**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The problem asks for the percentage difference to the nearest whole number, so I should round 177.78% accordingly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Final Adjustment:**\n  - Rounding 177.78% to the nearest whole number gives 178%.\n\n- **Checking Appropriateness:**\n  - The rounding is standard, and the percentage difference accurately reflects the area comparison.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Formatted Response:**\n- The area of the larger semicircles is approximately **178%** larger than the area of the smaller semicircles.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- **Overall Process:**\n  - By calculating the radii, areas of each semicircle, and the total areas for both sets, I was able to determine the percentage difference clearly.\n  \n- **Checking for Errors:**\n  - I consistently reflected and checked each step, ensuring that the calculations and approach made sense.\n  \n- **Alternative Strategies:**\n  - Considering different methods initially helped solidify the correctness of this approach.\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  - The step-by-step method, along with continuous reflection and checking, led to a reliable and accurate answer.\n\n---\n\nThis approach mimics human problem-solving by brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting, checking for correctness, and adjusting the method as needed. By thinking out loud and maintaining a flexible mindset, I was able to navigate the problem effectively.",

  "ground_truth": "The two large semicircles together make a circle of radius 5, which has area $25\\pi$.  The two small circles together make a circle with radius 3, which has area $9\\pi$.  Therefore, the ratio of the large semicircles' area to the small semicircles' area is $\\frac{25\\pi}{9\\pi} = \\frac{25}{9} \\approx 2.78$.    Since the large semicircles have area 2.78 times the small semicircles, the large semicircles' area is $278\\%$ of the small semicircles' area, which is an increase of $278\\% - 100\\% = \\boxed{178\\%}$ over the small semicircles' area."
