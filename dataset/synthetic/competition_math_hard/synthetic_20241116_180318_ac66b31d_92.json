    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, mimicking a natural human thought process. We'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check our work along the way. It's essential to think out loud, explore various approaches, and adjust as needed. Here's how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\(10^n = 10^{-5} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{10^{73}}{0.001}}\\), my initial reaction is that it involves exponents and square roots, both of which are familiar topics. This reminds me of problems where properties of exponents are applied to simplify expressions.\n\nBut then I think, \"Wait, dividing by a number in the decimal form (like 0.001) might complicate things a bit.\" It feels like I might need to convert everything into powers of 10 to make it easier to handle.\n\nI also recall that properties of exponents allow us to combine and simplify terms with the same base, which could be helpful here. Let me brainstorm a few strategies:\n\n1. **Convert all components to powers of 10:** This might make it easier to combine terms.\n2. **Simplify the square root separately:** Handle the square root part first before combining it with the other terms.\n3. **Use logarithms:** Although not necessary here, logarithms are another tool for dealing with exponents.\n\nLooking at these options, I think the first strategy\u2014converting everything to powers of 10\u2014seems the most straightforward. Let\u2019s start there.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Convert Everything to Powers of 10**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo simplify \\(10^{-5} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{10^{73}}{0.001}}\\), I\u2019ll convert both the numerator and denominator inside the square root to powers of 10. This should make it easier to handle the square root and combine everything later.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Convert 0.001 to a Power of 10:**\n   \\[\n   0.001 = 10^{-3}\n   \\]\n   (Since \\(10^{-3} = \\frac{1}{1000}\\))\n\n2. **Rewrite the Fraction Inside the Square Root:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10^{73}}{0.001} = \\frac{10^{73}}{10^{-3}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the Quotient Rule of Exponents:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10^{73}}{10^{-3}} = 10^{73 - (-3)} = 10^{76}\n   \\]\n   (Recall that dividing exponents with the same base subtracts the exponents)\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems correct because converting the denominator to a power of 10 simplifies the division. By subtracting exponents, I get \\(10^{76}\\), which is straightforward.\n\n**Check:**\nWait, let me briefly verify:\n- \\(0.001 = 10^{-3}\\) is accurate.\n- Dividing \\(10^{73}\\) by \\(10^{-3}\\) indeed adds 3 to 73, resulting in 76.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplify the Square Root**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to simplify \\(\\sqrt{10^{76}}\\). I remember that square roots and exponents are closely related, specifically \\(\\sqrt{10^x} = 10^{x/2}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{10^{76}} = 10^{76/2} = 10^{38}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis step feels straightforward because applying the square root to a power of 10 just involves dividing the exponent by 2. It\u2019s a standard property of exponents.\n\n**Check:**\nLet me think: does taking the square root of \\(10^{76}\\) logically lead to \\(10^{38}\\)?\n- Yes, because squaring \\(10^{38}\\) returns \\(10^{76}\\).\n\nSo, this seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Multiply with \\(10^{-5}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNext, I need to multiply \\(10^{-5}\\) with \\(10^{38}\\). Again, I recall the property of exponents that when multiplying same bases, you add the exponents.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n10^{-5} \\times 10^{38} = 10^{-5 + 38} = 10^{33}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nAdding exponents makes sense here. Starting from \\(-5\\) and moving up by 38 gives me 33. This feels intuitive and aligns with the properties of exponents.\n\n**Check:**\n\\(-5 + 38 = 33\\), so \\(10^{33}\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I should verify if \\(n = 33\\) satisfies the original equation. This is crucial to ensure that there were no missteps along the way.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Original Equation:**\n   \\[\n   10^n = 10^{-5} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{10^{73}}{0.001}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute \\(n = 33\\):**\n   \\[\n   10^{33} = 10^{-5} \\times 10^{38} = 10^{33}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe left side equals the right side when \\(n = 33\\). This confirms that our steps were correct.\n\n**Check:**\nBoth sides are \\(10^{33}\\), so they are equal. This aligns perfectly with the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nLooking back, converting everything to powers of 10 was an effective strategy. Each step followed logically, applying well-known properties of exponents. I briefly checked after each major step to ensure correctness, which helped catch any potential errors early.\n\nOverall, the value of \\(n\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{33}\n\\]\n\nBy reflecting frequently and verifying each part of the process, I was able to confidently arrive at the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We will simplify the fraction inside the square root first. Since $0.001=10^{-3}$, we can rewrite the fraction as $\\frac{10^{73}}{10^{-3}}=10^{76}$. The entire equation becomes $10^n=10^{-5}\\times \\sqrt{10^{76}}$. Taking the square root of $10^{76}$ gives us \\[\\sqrt{10^{76}} = \\sqrt{10^{38\\cdot 2}} = \\sqrt{(10^{38})^2} = 10^{38}.\\] Therefore, our equation now is $10^n=10^{-5}\\times 10^{38}$. The right hand side becomes $10^{-5+38}=10^{33}$. The equation becomes $10^n=10^{33}$, so $n=\\boxed{33}$."
