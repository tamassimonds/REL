    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll approach it like I would if I were solving it myself, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed. \n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The problem states that the sum of two positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is 1001.\n- I need to find the largest possible value of their greatest common divisor (\\(\\gcd(a, b)\\)).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **GCD Properties:** I remember that the \\(\\gcd\\) of two numbers is the largest integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n- **Relationship with Sum:** Since \\( a + b = 1001 \\), I think about how the \\(\\gcd\\) relates to their sum. Maybe if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are multiples of a common divisor, their sum might also be a multiple of that divisor.\n- **Exploring Multiples:** Perhaps finding common multiples of potential divisors could help.\n\n**Uncertainty:**\n- **Is GCD Linked to the Sum?** Wait, but the \\(\\gcd\\) itself doesn\u2019t directly depend on the sum; it\u2019s more about the relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). So, I need to explore further.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1:** **Use the Relationship Between GCD and LCM**\n\n- I recall a formula: \n  \\[\n  a \\times b = \\gcd(a, b) \\times \\text{lcm}(a, b)\n  \\]\n  \n- Given \\( a + b = 1001 \\), I could perhaps express \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in terms of their \\(\\gcd\\) and \\(\\text{lcm}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Complicated Approach:** This seems convoluted because I don\u2019t have direct information about \\(\\text{lcm}(a, b)\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Abandoning Strategy 1:** Since this approach involves unknowns and additional complexity, I\u2019ll look for a more straightforward method.\n\n**Strategy 2:** **Express \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in Terms of Their GCD**\n\n- Let\u2019s assume \\( \\gcd(a, b) = k \\).\n  \n- Then, \\( a = k \\times m \\) and \\( b = k \\times n \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime (i.e., \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 1\\)).\n\n- So, the equation becomes:\n  \\[\n  k \\times m + k \\times n = 1001 \\implies k \\times (m + n) = 1001\n  \\]\n  \n- This suggests that \\( k \\) must be a divisor of 1001.\n\n**Checking:**\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, because if \\( k \\) divides 1001 and \\( m + n \\) is an integer, then \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can be integers.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating Possible Values of \\( k \\)**\n\n**Step 1:** **Find the Divisors of 1001**\n\n- **Prime Factorization:**\n  \\[\n  1001 = 7 \\times 143\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  143 = 11 \\times 13\n  \\]\n  \n- **So,** \\( 1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\).\n\n- **Divisors:** The divisors of 1001 are:\n  \\[\n  1, 7, 11, 13, 77, 91, 143, 1001\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Choosing Divisors:** I need to consider which of these divisors can be the \\(\\gcd\\) such that \\( a = k \\times m \\) and \\( b = k \\times n \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime and their sum equals \\( \\frac{1001}{k} \\).\n\n**Step 2:** **Evaluate Each Divisor as Possible GCD**\n\n- **For \\( k = 1 \\):**\n  \\[\n  m + n = \\frac{1001}{1} = 1001\n  \\]\n  - **Possible:** But likely not the largest \\(\\gcd\\).\n\n- **For \\( k = 7 \\):**\n  \\[\n  m + n = \\frac{1001}{7} = 143\n  \\]\n  - **Possible:** Find \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) such that \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 1\\) and \\( m + n = 143 \\).\n  \n- **For \\( k = 11 \\):**\n  \\[\n  m + n = \\frac{1001}{11} = 91\n  \\]\n  - **Possible:** Similarly, find \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) with \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 1\\) and \\( m + n = 91 \\).\n  \n- **For \\( k = 13 \\):**\n  \\[\n  m + n = \\frac{1001}{13} = 77\n  \\]\n  - **Possible:** Find \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) with \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 1\\) and \\( m + n = 77 \\).\n  \n- **For \\( k = 77 \\):**\n  \\[\n  m + n = \\frac{1001}{77} = 13\n  \\]\n  - **Possible:** \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) could be 6 and 7, which are coprime and sum to 13.\n  \n- **For \\( k = 91 \\):**\n  \\[\n  m + n = \\frac{1001}{91} = 11\n  \\]\n  - **Possible:** \\( m = 5 \\), \\( n = 6 \\) are coprime and sum to 11.\n\n- **For \\( k = 143 \\):**\n  \\[\n  m + n = \\frac{1001}{143} = 7\n  \\]\n  - **Possible:** \\( m = 3 \\), \\( n = 4 \\) are coprime and sum to 7.\n\n- **For \\( k = 1001 \\):**\n  \\[\n  m + n = \\frac{1001}{1001} = 1\n  \\]\n  - **Not Possible:** \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) must be positive integers, and their only sum is 1 if one is 0, which contradicts the problem's requirement.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Valid Divisors for GCD:** So, the possible \\(\\gcd\\) values are 7, 11, 13, 77, 91, and 143.\n\n- **Largest Possible GCD:** Among these, 143 is the largest.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\( \\gcd(a, b) = 143 \\) make sense?\n  - If \\( \\gcd(a, b) = 143 \\), then:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{1001}{143} = 7 \\implies m + n = 7\n    \\]\n  - Possible pairs: \\( (3, 4) \\), which are coprime.\n\n- **Verification:** So, \\( a = 143 \\times 3 = 429 \\) and \\( b = 143 \\times 4 = 572 \\).\n  - **Sum Check:** \\( 429 + 572 = 1001 \\).\n  - **GCD Check:** \\( \\gcd(429, 572) = 143 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Confirmation**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** By expressing \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in terms of their \\(\\gcd\\), I was able to identify all possible \\(\\gcd\\) values that satisfy the sum condition.\n  \n- **Correctness Check:** Each step logically leads to the next, and the calculations confirm that the largest possible \\(\\gcd\\) is indeed 143.\n  \n- **Alternative Strategies:** Attempting to relate \\(\\gcd\\) and \\(\\text{lcm}\\) initially seemed complicated but led me back to the correct path by considering divisors of the sum.\n\n- **Final Answer:** The largest possible value of \\(\\gcd(a, b)\\) when \\( a + b = 1001 \\) is **143**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies and reflecting on each step, I concluded that the largest possible \\(\\gcd\\) of two integers whose sum is 1001 is **143**. This was achieved by expressing the integers in terms of their greatest common divisor and exploring all valid divisors of 1001. Regular checks ensured the correctness of the approach and solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Note that $\\gcd(a,b)$ divides both $a$ and $b$, so $\\gcd(a,b)$ must also divide $a + b = 1001$.  Clearly, $\\gcd(a,b)$ cannot be equal to 1001 (because both $a$ and $b$ must be less than 1001).  The next-largest divisor of 1001 is 143.  If $a = 143$ and $b = 1001 - 143 = 858$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(143,858) = 143$.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{143}$."
