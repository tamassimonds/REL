Express \\( N \\) in base 9.**\n\n**First Impressions:**\n- **Base 9:** Okay, we're not working in our usual base 10. That means I need to think about how numbers are represented in base 9, which uses digits 0 through 8.\n- **Square with Three Digits:** This reminds me of problems involving squares, but with a twist since we're dealing with different bases.\n- **Largest Integer:** I'm looking for the largest \\( N \\) that satisfies this condition, which makes me think about boundaries and maybe even the upper limit in base 9.\n  \n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Convert Base 9 to Base 10:** Maybe start by understanding what three-digit numbers in base 9 correspond to in base 10.\n2. **Find Base 10 Range for Squares:** Determine the range in base 10 where squares have three digits.\n3. **Calculate Corresponding Base 9 Numbers:** Convert those base 10 numbers back to base 9 to find \\( N \\).\n4. **Direct Approach in Base 9:** Try calculating squares directly in base 9 to see if that simplifies things.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 1: Convert Base 9 to Base 10**\n\nLet\u2019s start by thinking about what three-digit numbers in base 9 look like.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Range of Three-Digit Numbers in Base 9**\n\n- A three-digit number in base 9 ranges from \\( 100_9 \\) to \\( 888_9 \\).\n- **Convert \\( 100_9 \\) to Base 10:**\n  \\[\n  100_9 = 1 \\times 9^2 + 0 \\times 9^1 + 0 \\times 9^0 = 81_{10}\n  \\]\n- **Convert \\( 888_9 \\) to Base 10:**\n  \\[\n  888_9 = 8 \\times 9^2 + 8 \\times 9^1 + 8 \\times 9^0 = 648 + 72 + 8 = 728_{10}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- So, in base 10, we're looking at numbers between 81 and 728.\n- **Wait a moment...** This seems reasonable because 81 and 728 are both within the three-digit range in base 10.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Largest Integer \\( N \\) in Base 10**\n\nNow, I need to find the largest integer \\( N \\) such that \\( N^2 \\) falls within this range.\n\n- **Calculate the Square Root of 728:**\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{728} \\approx 26.97\n  \\]\n- **Round Down:** Since \\( N \\) must be an integer, the largest \\( N \\) is 26.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Wait**, let me double-check. Squaring 26:\n  \\[\n  26^2 = 676\n  \\]\n  And \\( 676 \\) is within \\( 81 \\) to \\( 728 \\).\n\n- **But let's check \\( N = 27 \\) too:**\n  \\[\n  27^2 = 729\n  \\]\n  \\( 729 \\) exceeds \\( 728 \\), so \\( N = 26 \\) is indeed correct.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 2: Convert \\( N = 26 \\) to Base 9**\n\nNow that I have \\( N = 26 \\) in base 10, I need to express this in base 9.\n\n**Step 3: Convert 26 from Base 10 to Base 9**\n\n- **Divide 26 by 9:**\n  \\[\n  26 \\div 9 = 2 \\text{ with a remainder of } 8\n  \\]\n  So, \\( 26_{10} = 28_9 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n- **Let me verify:** \\( 28_9 \\) in base 10 is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 9^1 + 8 \\times 9^0 = 18 + 8 = 26_{10}\n  \\]\n  This matches, so the conversion is correct.\n\n**Strategy Validation:**\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, because we've confirmed that the square of 26 is within the desired range, and the base conversion checks out.\n\n### Final Thoughts and Conclusion\n\n- **Reflection:** By converting the three-digit range from base 9 to base 10, I was able to identify the largest integer \\( N \\) whose square fits within that range. Converting back to base 9 gave me the correct representation.\n- **Check Throughout:** At each step, I ensured the calculations aligned with the base conversions and verified the correctness by checking squares and base conversions.\n- **Did Anything Go Wrong?** Not particularly, but I initially considered converting directly in base 9, which seemed more complex.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe largest integer \\( N \\) whose square has exactly three digits in base 9 is \\( 28_9 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{28_9}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach ensured that each part of the problem was carefully considered and validated, leading to a correct and confident solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $n^2$ has exactly $3$ digits in base 9 if and only if $$9^2\\le n^2<9^3.$$Taking square roots, we have $$3^2\\le n<3^3.$$We are looking for $N$, the ${\\bf largest}$ integer $n$ satisfying the above constraints. So, $$N=3^3-1=3\\cdot 9-1 =2\\cdot 9+8.$$Written in base $9$, this is $\\boxed{28}$ or $\\boxed{28_9}$."
