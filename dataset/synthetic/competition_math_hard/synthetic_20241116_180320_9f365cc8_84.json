    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each approach, and checking my work as I go to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The expression is \\( \\sqrt{75x} \\cdot \\sqrt{2x} \\cdot \\sqrt{14x} \\).\n- I need to calculate this product and express the answer in the simplest radical form in terms of \\( x \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Similar Problems:** This reminds me of properties of square roots and exponents that I've used before.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Combine Radicals:** Use the property \\( \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{a \\cdot b} \\) to combine the square roots.\n  2. **Simplify Each Radical First:** Simplify each square root individually before multiplying.\n  3. **Factor Inside the Radicals:** Factor numbers under the square roots to simplify further.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Combining radicals seems like a natural first step because it might simplify the expression significantly.\n- However, I need to consider if simplifying each radical first might make things clearer, especially with multiple terms involved.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Let me attempt combining the radicals first and see how it looks. If it gets messy, I can try another approach.\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting to Combine Radicals**\n\n**Trying Strategy 1: Combine Radicals**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{75x} \\cdot \\sqrt{2x} \\cdot \\sqrt{14x} = \\sqrt{75x \\cdot 2x \\cdot 14x}\n\\]\n\n**Calcululations:**\n\n- **Multiply Inside the Radical:**\n  \n  \\[\n  75 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 14 = 150 \\cdot 14 = 2100\n  \\]\n\n- **Accounting for \\( x \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  x \\cdot x \\cdot x = x^3\n  \\]\n\n- **Combined Expression:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{2100x^3}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Combining the radicals simplified the expression under a single square root.\n- But now, I need to simplify \\( \\sqrt{2100x^3} \\). Let me see how to break down 2100 and handle \\( x^3 \\).\n\n**Check: Is This the Simplest Form?**\n\n- Before proceeding, let's consider if there's a way to simplify \\( \\sqrt{2100x^3} \\) further by factoring 2100.\n\n### **Step 3: Factorizing the Number Inside the Radical**\n\n**Thinking:**\n\n- To simplify \\( \\sqrt{2100} \\), it's helpful to factor 2100 into its prime components.\n- Also, let's see how \\( x^3 \\) can be handled under a square root.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Factor 2100:**\n  \n  \\[\n  2100 = 21 \\times 100 = 21 \\times (10^2) = 21 \\times 100\n  \\]\n  \n  Breaking down further:\n  \n  \\[\n  21 = 3 \\times 7\n  \\]\n  \n  So,\n  \n  \\[\n  2100 = 3 \\times 7 \\times 10^2 = 3 \\times 7 \\times (2 \\times 5)^2 = 3 \\times 7 \\times 2^2 \\times 5^2\n  \\]\n  \n  **Prime Factorization:**\n  \n  \\[\n  2100 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^1\n  \\]\n\n- **Handle \\( x^3 \\) Under Square Root:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{x^3} = \\sqrt{x^2 \\times x} = x \\sqrt{x}\n  \\]\n  \n  (since \\( \\sqrt{x^2} = x \\))\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This factorization helps in simplifying \\( \\sqrt{2100} \\).\n- Now, let\u2019s see how to pull out squares from under the radical.\n\n### **Step 4: Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{2100} \\) Using Prime Factorization**\n\n**Calcululations:**\n\n- **Identify Perfect Squares:**\n  \n  From the prime factorization:\n  \n  \\[\n  2100 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^1\n  \\]\n  \n  - \\( 2^2 \\) is a perfect square.\n  - \\( 5^2 \\) is a perfect square.\n  \n- **Pull Out Perfect Squares:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{2100} = \\sqrt{2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 \\times 7} = 2 \\times 5 \\times \\sqrt{3 \\times 7} = 10 \\sqrt{21}\n  \\]\n  \n  (since \\( \\sqrt{2^2} = 2 \\) and \\( \\sqrt{5^2} = 5 \\))\n\n- **Include \\( \\sqrt{x} \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{2100x^3} = 10 \\sqrt{21} \\times x \\sqrt{x} = 10x \\sqrt{21x}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This simplification looks clean.\n- The original expression is now in terms of \\( x \\) and a simplified radical.\n- Let me check if each step aligns:\n\n  - Factorization seems correct.\n  - Pulling out perfect squares checks out.\n  - Multiplying by \\( x \\sqrt{x} \\) is handled properly.\n\n**Check: Is the Answer in Simplest Radical Form?**\n\n- The answer contains \\( x \\sqrt{x} \\) multiplied by a simplified radical \\( \\sqrt{21} \\).\n- I believe this is the simplest form as all perfect squares are extracted.\n\n### **Step 5: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\n- The expression \\( \\sqrt{75x} \\cdot \\sqrt{2x} \\cdot \\sqrt{14x} \\) simplifies to \\( 10x \\sqrt{21x} \\).\n- It\u2019s essential to present the answer clearly, ensuring all steps are logically connected.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{75x} \\cdot \\sqrt{2x} \\cdot \\sqrt{14x} = 10x \\sqrt{21x}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- By combining the radicals first and then factorizing the number inside the square root, I was able to simplify the expression effectively.\n- Throughout the process, reflecting on each step ensured accuracy and helped catch any potential mistakes early.\n- Checking whether the form was the simplest radical form confirmed the validity of the final answer.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed approach mimics human-like problem-solving, showcasing brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking work regularly, and adjusting methods as needed to arrive at the correct solution.",
