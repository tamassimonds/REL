The goal is to find the length of the shorter leg. \n\n- **First Impression:** This reminds me of the Pythagorean theorem, which relates the lengths of the sides in a right triangle: \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\), where \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse. \n- **Brainstorming:** Given that the hypotenuse is 39, I need to find integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) whose squares sum up to \\( 39^2 = 1521 \\). \n- **Alternative Thoughts:** Maybe there's a pattern with Pythagorean triples? Or perhaps I can list out possible integer legs and see which fit.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Pythagorean Theorem:** Use \\( a^2 + b^2 = 39^2 \\) and solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   \n2. **List Possible Integer Legs:** Generate pairs of integers whose squares might add up to 1521.\n\n3. **Use Pythagorean Triples:** Recall that for integer sides, there are known Pythagorean triples that might include 39.\n\n**Wait, let\u2019s see...**  \nI think starting with the Pythagorean theorem is straightforward. If that seems too complicated, I can then try listing possible legs or looking up Pythagorean triples.\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's use the Pythagorean theorem:  \n\\[ a^2 + b^2 = 39^2 \\]  \nWe know \\( c = 39 \\), so \\( a^2 + b^2 = 1521 \\).\n\n**Solving for One Leg:**\n\nAssume \\( a \\leq b \\) (a common practice to simplify).  \nSo, \\( a^2 + b^2 = 1521 \\) and we need to find integer values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Rearranging the Equation:**\n\nLet's express \\( b^2 \\) in terms of \\( a^2 \\):  \n\\[ b^2 = 1521 - a^2 \\]\n\n**Checking for Integer Solutions:**\n\nSince \\( b^2 \\) must be a perfect square, \\( 1521 - a^2 \\) should also be a perfect square.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this approach involves checking multiple values of \\( a \\) to see if \\( 1521 - a^2 \\) is a perfect square. It might take some time, but let's give it a try for a few values.\n\n### **Step 3: Trying Different Values of \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI'll start with \\( a = 1 \\) and go up to \\( a = 38 \\) (since \\( a \\) must be less than 39). For each \\( a \\), I'll calculate \\( b^2 = 1521 - a^2 \\) and see if \\( b^2 \\) is a perfect square.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **For \\( a = 1 \\):**  \n  \\( b^2 = 1521 - 1^2 = 1520 \\)  \n  \\( \\sqrt{1520} \\) is not an integer.\n\n- **For \\( a = 2 \\):**  \n  \\( b^2 = 1521 - 2^2 = 1517 \\)  \n  \\( \\sqrt{1517} \\) is not an integer.\n\n- **Skipping ahead...**\n\n- **For \\( a = 30 \\):**  \n  \\( b^2 = 1521 - 30^2 = 1521 - 900 = 621 \\)  \n  \\( \\sqrt{621} \\) is not an integer.\n\n- **For \\( a = 35 \\):**  \n  \\( b^2 = 1521 - 35^2 = 1521 - 1225 = 296 \\)  \n  \\( \\sqrt{296} \\) is not an integer.\n\n- **For \\( a = 36 \\):**  \n  \\( b^2 = 1521 - 36^2 = 1521 - 1296 = 225 \\)  \n  \\( \\sqrt{225} = 15 \\), which is an integer.\n\n**Wait, hold on...**  \nI found \\( a = 36 \\) and \\( b = 15 \\) (since \\( b^2 = 225 \\)). This fits the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's confirm that these values satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Check:  \n  \\( 36^2 + 15^2 = 1296 + 225 = 1521 = 39^2 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nYes, it checks out! \\( 36^2 + 15^2 = 39^2 \\). So, the lengths \\( a = 36 \\) and \\( b = 15 \\) are correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying the Shorter Leg**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince we're asked for the length of the shorter leg and we assumed \\( a \\leq b \\), the shorter leg is \\( a = 15 \\) units.\n\n**Wait, let me double-check...**  \nI initially assigned \\( a = 36 \\) and \\( b = 15 \\), but since \\( a \\leq b \\), I must have mixed them up. So, the shorter leg is indeed **15 units**.\n\n### **Step 6: Cross-Checking with Pythagorean Triples**\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\nJust to be sure, let's see if 39 fits into any known Pythagorean triples.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nPythagorean triples are sets of three integers \\( (a, b, c) \\) that satisfy \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\). Maybe 39 is part of such a triple.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLooking up or recalling Pythagorean triples involving 39:\n\n- **Triple:** \\( (15, 36, 39) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms our earlier finding. The triple \\( (15, 36, 39) \\) satisfies the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Started with the Pythagorean theorem and considered listing possible legs or using Pythagorean triples.\n  \n- **Approach Taken:** Used the Pythagorean theorem to find integer legs by checking values of \\( a \\) and calculating \\( b \\).\n\n- **Checking Work:** Verified that \\( a = 36 \\) and \\( b = 15 \\) satisfy the theorem. Cross-checked with known Pythagorean triples.\n\n- **Confirmation:** The shorter leg is **15 units**.\n\n**Conclusion:** After exploring different strategies and verifying the solution multiple ways, the length of the shorter leg is **15 units**.",
