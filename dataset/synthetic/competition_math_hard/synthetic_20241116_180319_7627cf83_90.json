    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I\u2019ll walk through my initial thoughts, brainstorm different strategies, and reflect often to ensure I\u2019m on the right track. If something doesn\u2019t seem right, I\u2019ll try a different approach. The goal is to think as naturally and thoroughly as possible, just like a human would when solving a problem.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nSo, the problem states that a parabola with the equation \\(y = x^2 + bx + c\\) passes through the points \\((-1, -11)\\) and \\((3, 17)\\). We're asked to find the value of \\(c\\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- This looks like a typical problem involving quadratic equations and points on a graph. \n- I\u2019ve seen similar problems where you plug in values to solve for coefficients.\n- My first thought is that we have two points, so perhaps we can set up a system of equations to find \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Set up a system of equations:** Plug the given points into the parabola equation to create two equations with \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n2. **Use vertex form of a parabola:** If I\u2019re familiar with it, perhaps convert the standard form to vertex form and utilize properties of parabolas.\n3. **Graphical approach:** Although not precise, sketching might give a rough idea.\n4. **Matrix methods:** Use matrices to solve the system, which might be overkill but an option.\n\n**Hmm... maybe starting with the system of equations is the most straightforward.** Let\u2019s try that and see where it leads.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), I can substitute each point into the parabola equation.\n- This will give me two equations with two unknowns.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **For the point \\((-1, -11)\\):**\n   \\[\n   -11 = (-1)^2 + b(-1) + c \\\\\n   -11 = 1 - b + c \\\\\n   \\]\n   So, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   1 - b + c = -11 \\\\\n   -b + c = -11 - 1 \\\\\n   -b + c = -12 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **For the point \\((3, 17)\\):**\n   \\[\n   17 = (3)^2 + b(3) + c \\\\\n   17 = 9 + 3b + c \\\\\n   \\]\n   So, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   9 + 3b + c = 17 \\\\\n   3b + c = 17 - 9 \\\\\n   3b + c = 8 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Now I have a system of linear equations:\n  - Equation 1: \\(-b + c = -12\\)\n  - Equation 2: \\(3b + c = 8\\)\n\n**Check: Does this make sense?**\n- Yes, substituting the points should yield consistent equations for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to solve this system to find \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n- A common method is to eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting the equations.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:**\n   \\[\n   (3b + c) - (-b + c) = 8 - (-12) \\\\\n   3b + c + b - c = 8 + 12 \\\\\n   4b = 20 \\\\\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait, does \\(b = 5\\) make sense?** Let\u2019s plug it back into one of the equations to check.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Substitute \\(b = 5\\) into Equation 1:\n  \\[\n  -5 + c = -12 \\\\\n  c = -12 + 5 \\\\\n  c = -7\n  \\]\n  \n- Now, let\u2019s check if these values satisfy Equation 2:\n  \\[\n  3(5) + (-7) = 15 - 7 = 8 \\quad \\text{(matches Equation 2)}\n  \\]\n  \n**Conclusion:**\n- The values \\(b = 5\\) and \\(c = -7\\) satisfy both equations.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- It\u2019s essential to verify that these coefficients make the parabola pass through the given points.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let\u2019s plug the values back into the original parabola equation and check both points.\n\n1. **For \\((-1, -11)\\):**\n   \\[\n   y = (-1)^2 + 5(-1) + (-7) \\\\\n   y = 1 - 5 - 7 \\\\\n   y = -11 \\quad \\text{(matches)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **For \\((3, 17)\\):**\n   \\[\n   y = (3)^2 + 5(3) + (-7) \\\\\n   y = 9 + 15 - 7 \\\\\n   y = 17 \\quad \\text{(matches)}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both points satisfy the parabola equation with the found coefficients.\n- **This confirms that our solution is correct.**\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Check**\n\n**Wait a moment, did I miss anything?**\n- I initially considered other strategies like using the vertex form or graphical methods, but setting up the system of equations was straightforward and effective.\n\n**Does the final answer make sense?**\n- Yes, \\(c = -7\\) aligns with the calculations and verification steps.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n- **Perhaps I could have double-checked by using the vertex form or another method to cross-verify,** but since the system of equations worked seamlessly, it wasn\u2019t necessary.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully setting up and solving the system of equations derived from the given points, we determined that:\n\n- \\(b = 5\\)\n- \\(c = -7\\)\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(c\\) is \\(\\boxed{-7}\\).\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed step-by-step approach mimics natural human problem-solving, complete with brainstorming, reflections, checks, and adjustments along the way. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!",

  "ground_truth": "We substitute these two points into the given equation to solve for $c$. Plugging in $(-1,-11)$, we get $-11=(-1)^2-1b+c\\Rightarrow -b+c=-12$. Plugging in $(3,17)$, we get $17=3^2+3b+c \\Rightarrow 3b+c=8$. In summary, we have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n-b+c&=-12\\\\\n3b+c&=8\n\\end{align*} Multiplying the first equation by 3, we have $-3b+3c=-36$. Adding the second equation to this last one, we have $(-3b+3c)+(3b+c)=-36+8 \\Rightarrow c=\\boxed{-7}$.\n\nThe parabola is graphed below: [asy]\n\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(-9,4,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nyaxis(-13,17,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn x^2+5x-7;\n\n}\n\ndraw(graph(f,-8,3), Arrows(4));\n\n[/asy]"
