    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I\u2019ll brainstorm various strategies, reflect on each step, check my work often, and adjust my approach as needed. Think of it like walking through a puzzle\u2014sometimes I\u2019ll hit a roadblock and need to backtrack or maybe find a shortcut.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have **two concentric circles** (meaning they share the same center) with radii of 19 and 29 units. The **shaded region** is the area between these two circles. \n\n- **Concentric Circles:** These are circles that have the same center but different radii. The smaller circle is inside the larger one.\n  \n- **Shaded Region:** This is the **annular (ring-shaped) region** between the two circles.\n\nNow, a **third circle will be drawn** with an area equal to that of the shaded region. The question asks for the radius of this third circle, expressed in simplest radical form.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region:**\n   - I\u2019ll need to find the area of both circles and subtract the area of the smaller circle from the larger one.\n\n2. **Determine the Radius of the Third Circle:**\n   - Once I have the area of the shaded region, I can find the radius of the third circle by setting its area equal to this shaded area.\n\n3. **Check for Possible Shortcuts:**\n   - Maybe I can use the formula for the area of a circle and solve for the radius directly after finding the shaded area.\n   - Alternatively, see if there's a relationship between the areas and the radii that might simplify the calculation.\n\n**Reflecting on the Plan:**\n\n- The first step seems straightforward: Find the area of the shaded region.\n- The second step involves solving for the radius of the third circle using the area found.\n- I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a shortcut, but since the problem asks for the radius in simplest radical form, it might require a bit of algebra.\n\n**Wait a minute\u2026** Wouldn\u2019t it be better to first verify if the areas are indeed as expected? Maybe double-check the calculations as I go to ensure accuracy.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s proceed with the first step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the area of the shaded region, I need to calculate the area of the larger circle and subtract the area of the smaller circle.\n\n**Formulas:**\n\n- Area of a circle: \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\)\n  \nWhere \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Area of the Larger Circle:**\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{large}} = \\pi (29)^2 = \\pi \\times 841 = 841\\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Area of the Smaller Circle:**\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{small}} = \\pi (19)^2 = \\pi \\times 361 = 361\\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Area of the Shaded Region:**\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{shaded}} = A_{\\text{large}} - A_{\\text{small}} = 841\\pi - 361\\pi = 480\\pi\n   \\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- Does this make sense? The area of the shaded region should be the difference between the two circles\u2019 areas. \n- \\( 841\\pi - 361\\pi = 480\\pi \\) seems correct since \\( 841 - 361 = 480 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis step looks good. The area of the shaded region is \\( 480\\pi \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Radius of the Third Circle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe area of the third circle is equal to the area of the shaded region, which we found to be \\( 480\\pi \\). \n\nWe need to find the radius \\( r \\) of this third circle such that:\n\n\\[\n\\pi r^2 = 480\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n\n- I can divide both sides by \\( \\pi \\) to simplify:\n  \\[\n  r^2 = 480\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- To find \\( r \\), take the square root of both sides:\n  \\[\n  r = \\sqrt{480}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflecting on the Square Root:**\n\nHmm, \\( \\sqrt{480} \\) isn\u2019t a perfect square. Let me simplify it to express it in radical form.\n\n**Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{480} \\):**\n\n- **Factor 480:**\n  \\[\n  480 = 48 \\times 10 = (16 \\times 3) \\times (2 \\times 5) = 16 \\times 10 \\times 3 = 160 \\times 3\n  \\]\n  \n  But let\u2019s break it down differently:\n  \\[\n  480 = 16 \\times 30 = 16 \\times (3 \\times 10) = 16 \\times 3 \\times 10 = 48 \\times 10\n  \\]\n  \n  Alternatively:\n  \\[\n  480 = 2^5 \\times 3 \\times 5\n  \\]\n  \n  Ah, I see that \\( 480 = 16 \\times 30 = 4^2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 48 \\times 10 \\).\n\n- **Taking the Square Root:**\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{480} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 30} = \\sqrt{16} \\times \\sqrt{30} = 4\\sqrt{30}\n  \\]\n  \n  Or:\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{480} = \\sqrt{2^5 \\times 3 \\times 5} = 2^{2.5} \\times \\sqrt{15} = 4\\sqrt{15}\n  \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nWait, which simplification is correct? Let\u2019s double-check:\n\n- From \\( 16 \\times 30 \\): \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{16} \\times \\sqrt{30} = 4\\sqrt{30}\n  \\]\n  \n- From \\( 2^5 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\): \n  \\[\n  2^{2.5} \\times \\sqrt{15} = 4\\sqrt{15}\n  \\]\n  \n- Alternatively:\n  \\[\n  480 = 16 \\times 30 = 4^2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 48 \\times 10 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{48 \\times 10} = \\sqrt{48} \\times \\sqrt{10} = 4\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{10} = 4\\sqrt{30}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nIt looks like there\u2019s a discrepancy. Let me verify:\n\n- \\( \\sqrt{16 \\times 30} = 4\\sqrt{30} \\) is correct.\n- \\( \\sqrt{2^5 \\times 3 \\times 5} = 4\\sqrt{15} \\) seems off.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s calculate \\( \\sqrt{480} \\) using a calculator:\n\n- \\( \\sqrt{480} \\approx 21.908 \\)\n- \\( 4\\sqrt{30} \\approx 21.908 \\)\n- \\( 4\\sqrt{15} \\approx 15.491 \\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWait, \\( 4\\sqrt{15} \\) is less than \\( 21.908 \\), which doesn\u2019t match \\( \\sqrt{480} \\). \n\nRechecking:\n\n- \\( \\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.872 \\)\n- \\( 4 \\times 3.872 \\approx 15.491 \\), which is less than \\( 21.908 \\)\n\n**Realization:**\n\nAh, I see the mistake now. When simplifying:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^5 \\times 3 \\times 5} = 2^{2.5} \\times \\sqrt{15} = 4\\sqrt{15}\n\\]\nBut this underestimates because the extra factor of 2 needs to be accounted for.\n\n**Correct Simplification:**\n\nLet\u2019s stick with the simpler approach:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{480} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 30} = 4\\sqrt{30}\n\\]\nSeems more accurate.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe radius of the third circle is \\( \\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Checks:**\n\n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n  - \\( \\sqrt{480} \\) should be approximately 21.908.\n  - \\( 4\\sqrt{30}} \\approx 21.908, which matches.\n\n- **Is the Simplification Correct?**\n  - Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{480} \\) to \\( 4\\sqrt{30} \\) aligns with the area calculation.\n  - \\( 4\\sqrt{30} \\) is in its simplest radical form.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe answer checks out. Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{480} \\) to \\( 4\\sqrt{30} \\) is correct, and the radius makes sense numerically.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Verifying Simplification Steps**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify each step in simplifying \\( \\sqrt{480} \\).\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Factor 480 Correctly:**\n   \\[\n   480 = 16 \\times 30 = 4^2 \\times 15 = 4^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 16 \\times 15\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate Square Root:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{480} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 30} = \\sqrt{16} \\times \\sqrt{30} = 4\\sqrt{30}\n   \\]\n   \n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes \\( 4\\sqrt{30}} \\approx 21.908 \\)?\n\\[\n\\sqrt{30} \\approx 5.477 \\implies 4 \\times 5.477 \\approx 21.908\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms that \\( 4\\sqrt{30}} \\) is indeed the correct simplification.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought: Embracing the Step-by-Step Approach**\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically:\n\n- **Calculated the shaded area accurately.**\n- **Derived the radius of the third circle through straightforward algebra.**\n- **Verified each simplification step, ensuring accuracy in radical form.**\n\nThis ensures not only correctness but also builds confidence in the solution. Always reflecting and checking along the way helps catch and correct any missteps early.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe radius of the third circle is \\( \\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}} \\), determined through systematic area calculations and careful radical simplifications, ensuring each step aligns with the expected mathematical principles.",
