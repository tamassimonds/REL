    "working_out": "Absolutely, I can tackle this problem just like a human would\u2014brainstorming strategies, reflecting on each step, checking for correctness, and adjusting approaches as needed. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = 3, \\\\\nxy + x + y = 4\n\\]\n\nI need to compute \\(x^2y + xy^2\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Familiar Patterns:** This reminds me of systems of equations. I\u2019ve dealt with similar problems where manipulating one equation helps solve for variables in another.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Substitution:** Solve one equation for a variable and substitute it into the other.\n  - **Factoring:** See if the second equation can be factored to relate to the first.\n  - **Expression Rearrangement:** Try to express \\(x^2y + xy^2\\) in terms of known quantities.\n\n- **Concerns:** \n  - The first equation involves reciprocals, which can be tricky.\n  - The second equation looks like a quadratic form, but it doesn\u2019t immediately align with the first.\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\nI remember that \\(x^2y + xy^2\\) can be factored as \\(xy(x + y)\\). Maybe I can leverage that to connect the two equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf I can express \\(x^2y + xy^2\\) in terms of \\(xy\\) and \\(x + y\\), I might be able to relate it to the given equations.\n\n**Factorization:**\n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = xy(x + y)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is interesting because \\(xy\\) and \\(x + y\\) seem to be components I can derive from the given equations. But let's verify if this approach is viable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting to Find \\(x + y\\) and \\(xy\\)**\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nTry to find expressions for \\(x + y\\) and \\(xy\\) using the given equations.\n\n**Work on the First Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = 3\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(xy\\):\n\n\\[\ny + x = 3xy\n\\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\[\nx + y = 3xy\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this look correct? Let\u2019s see. By multiplying both sides by \\(xy\\), I eliminate the denominators, which seems logical.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis substitution seems correct. It links \\(x + y\\) directly to \\(xy\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Using the Second Equation**\n\n**Given:**\n\n\\[\nxy + x + y = 4\n\\]\n\nBut from the first equation, we have \\(x + y = 3xy\\). So, substitute that into the second equation:\n\n\\[\nxy + 3xy = 4 \\\\\n4xy = 4\n\\]\n\n**Solve for \\(xy\\):**\n\n\\[\nxy = 1\n\\]\n\n**Wait, Let Me Double Check:**\n\n- Substituted correctly: \\(x + y = 3xy\\) into \\(xy + x + y = 4\\).\n- Simplified correctly: \\(xy + 3xy = 4\\) \u2192 \\(4xy = 4\\) \u2192 \\(xy = 1\\).\n\nThis seems correct. I\u2019ve isolated \\(xy\\) successfully.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding \\(x + y\\)**\n\n**From Step 2:**\n\n\\[\nx + y = 3xy\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(xy = 1\\):\n\n\\[\nx + y = 3(1) = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, \\(x + y = 3\\) and \\(xy = 1\\). This is a familiar setup\u2014like the sum and product of roots in a quadratic equation.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nI can now think of the variables as roots of a quadratic equation. It feels like I\u2019m on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Expressing \\(x^2y + xy^2\\) in Terms of \\(x + y\\) and \\(xy\\)**\n\n**Recalling the Factorization:**\n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = xy(x + y)\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\nxy = 1 \\\\\nx + y = 3\n\\]\n\n**Substitute:**\n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = xy \\times (x + y) = 1 \\times 3 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Substituted \\(xy = 1\\) and \\(x + y = 3\\) correctly.\n- Multiplication is straightforward: \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\).\n\nThis looks correct. The factorization helps directly compute the desired expression.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n**Was the Approach Correct?**\n\n- **Factorization Insight:** Recognizing \\(x^2y + xy^2 = xy(x + y)\\) was crucial.\n- **Correct Substitutions:** Successfully derived \\(x + y = 3\\) and \\(xy = 1\\).\n- **Consistent Checkpoints:** After each major step, I checked if the substitution and simplification were correct.\n\n**Alternative Strategies Considered:**\n\n- **Solving for Individual Variables:** Could have attempted to solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) individually, but that would be more complex and unnecessary once recognizing the factorization.\n- **Factoring the Second Equation:** Initially thought about factoring \\(xy + x + y = 4\\), but that led back to the same direct substitution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy leveraging the factorization \\(x^2y + xy^2 = xy(x + y)\\) and systematically substituting values from the given equations, I arrived at the solution:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis approach, starting with brainstorming and recognizing patterns, led efficiently to the solution. Reflecting and checking each step ensured correctness and prevented mistakes. In real-life problem-solving, such iterative thinking and validation are crucial for accurate outcomes.",
