    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem by simulating human-like brainstorming and exploring various strategies. I'll write out my thoughts, reflect, and adjust my approach as needed, just like a person would when tackling a real problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, it states that:\n> Let \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) be positive real numbers such that \\( a + 2b = 1 \\). Find the minimum value of \\( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} \\).\n\n**First Reaction:**\n- **Familiar:** This reminds me of optimization problems involving constraints, possibly like the ones where the Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM inequalities might be applicable.\n- **Uncertain:** I\u2019m not entirely sure if those are the right tools here or if another method would work better.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Substitution Method:** Express one variable in terms of the other using the given constraint.\n2. **Inequality Approach:** Utilize inequality theorems like AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz to find a lower bound.\n3. **Calculus Approach:** If the variables are continuous, use derivatives to find minimum points.\n4. **Lagrange Multipliers:** Though typically used for multidimensional problems, I wonder if it might apply here for checking extrema under constraints.\n\n**Reflection:**\nGiven that we're dealing with a single equation relating \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and both are positive real numbers, the **Substitution Method** seems straightforward. Following that, I could check if inequalities can provide a quicker solution.\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Substitution Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s start by solving the constraint \\( a + 2b = 1 \\) for one variable in terms of the other. This way, I can substitute back into the expression \\( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} \\) to make it a single-variable function.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Solve for \\( a \\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 1 - 2b\n  \\]\n  \n  *(Since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive, \\( 1 - 2b > 0 \\) implies \\( b < \\frac{1}{2} \\)).*\n\n- **Substitute into the Expression:**\n  \\[\n  f(b) = \\frac{1}{1 - 2b} + \\frac{2}{b}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis looks like a standard optimization problem now. I can derive this function with respect to \\( b \\) and find the critical points to determine the minimum.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculus Approach to Find Critical Points**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince \\( f(b) \\) involves both \\( \\frac{1}{1 - 2b} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{b} \\), differentiating with respect to \\( b \\) will help identify where the function reaches its minimum.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Differentiate \\( f(b) \\):**\n  \\[\n  f'(b) = \\frac{d}{db}\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - 2b}\\right) + \\frac{d}{db}\\left(\\frac{2}{b}\\right)\n  \\]\n  \n  Using the quotient rule or recognizing standard derivatives:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{d}{db}\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - 2b}\\right) = \\frac{2}{(1 - 2b)^2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{d}{db}\\left(\\frac{2}{b}\\right) = -\\frac{2}{b^2}\n  \\]\n  \n  So,\n  \\[\n  f'(b) = \\frac{2}{(1 - 2b)^2} - \\frac{2}{b^2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Set \\( f'(b) = 0 \\) to Find Critical Points:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{(1 - 2b)^2} = \\frac{2}{b^2}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Simplify:**\n  \\[\n  (1 - 2b)^2 = b^2\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  1 - 4b + 4b^2 = b^2\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  3b^2 - 4b + 1 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**\n  \\[\n  b = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1}}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 12}}{6} = \\frac{4 \\pm 2}{6}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  b = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nOne of the solutions, \\( b = 1 \\), would make \\( a = -1 \\) (since \\( a = 1 - 2b \\)), which isn't acceptable as both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be positive reals. So, the only viable solution is \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Finding Corresponding \\( a \\) and Evaluating the Minimum**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\), I can find \\( a \\) and then calculate the minimum value of the original expression \\( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Find \\( a \\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Compute the Minimum Value:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3}} + \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 3 + 6 = 9\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nThe minimum value is \\( 9 \\). Let\u2019s quickly verify whether this critical point indeed corresponds to a minimum by checking the second derivative or evaluating the function around this point.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Minimum Value**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure that \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\) is a minimum, I can either check the second derivative test or simply evaluate the function values around \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Second Derivative Test:**\n  \\[\n  f''(b) = \\frac{d}{db}\\left(\\frac{2}{(1 - 2b)^2}\\right) - \\frac{d}{db}\\left(\\frac{2}{b^2}\\right)\n  \\]\n  \n  Using the power rule:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{d}{db}\\left(\\frac{2}{(1 - 2b)^2}\\right) = \\frac{8}{(1 - 2b)^3}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{d}{db}\\left(-\\frac{2}{b^2}\\right) = \\frac{4}{b^3}\n  \\]\n  \n  So,\n  \\[\n  f''(b) = \\frac{8}{(1 - 2b)^3} + \\frac{4}{b^3}\n  \\]\n  \n  **At \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\):**\n  \\[\n  f''\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{8}{\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3} + \\frac{4}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3} = \\frac{8}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3} + \\frac{4}{\\frac{1}{27}} = 216 + 108 = 324\n  \\]\n  \n  Since \\( f''\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) > 0 \\), it confirms that \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\) is a **local minimum**.\n  \n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The second derivative is positive, confirming that the critical point is indeed a minimum. \n\n### **Step 5: Exploring Alternative Methods**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWhile the calculus approach provided the correct minimum, I\u2019m curious if using inequalities could offer a quicker solution. Maybe applying the **AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean) inequality** could simplify the problem.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **AM-GM Inequality:** This can be used to relate the sum and product of positive numbers.\n- **Given Constraint:** \\( a + 2b = 1 \\), which can be split into parts to apply AM-GM.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Apply AM-GM to \\( a + 2b \\):**\n  \n  Split \\( 2b \\) into two equal parts:\n  \\[\n  a + b + b = 1\n  \\]\n  \n  According to AM-GM:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{a + b + b}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{ab^2}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{ab^2}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Cubing both sides:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{27} \\geq ab^2\n  \\]\n  \n  **Express \\( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} \\) in terms of \\( ab^2 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} = \\frac{b^2 + 2a}{ab^2}\n  \\]\n  \n  **But wait...** This seems to complicate things further because I don\u2019t have an immediate relation between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in terms of \\( ab^2 \\) that simplifies the expression.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis approach is not straightforward and seems to lead to more complexity without directly solving for the minimum. It\u2019s interesting to see that while AM-GM can provide bounds, in this case, the calculus method was more direct and effective.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, the **Substitution Method** followed by **Calculus** proved to be the most straightforward path to find the minimum value. Although trying AM-GM provided some insights, it didn't simplify the problem as effectively as expected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe minimum value of \\( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} \\) given the constraint \\( a + 2b = 1 \\) is **9**, occurring at \\( a = \\frac{1}{3} \\) and \\( b = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n---\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected and verified each step to ensure the correctness of the approach, adjusting strategies when one didn't lead to a clear solution. This human-like thinking, with brainstorming, checking, and adapting, ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",
