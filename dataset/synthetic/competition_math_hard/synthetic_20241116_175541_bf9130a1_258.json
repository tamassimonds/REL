    "working_out": "### First Thoughts\n\nOkay, let's dive into this problem. Mark borrows $10 from Emily with a simple interest rate of 15% **per day**. The goal is to determine the least integer number of days after which Mark will owe her at least double the borrowed amount, i.e., $20.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Recalling Simple Interest Concepts:** From my previous experiences with simple interest, I remember that interest accumulates over time based on the principal amount, the rate, and the duration. The formula I often used is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Amount} = \\text{Principal} \\times (1 + \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time})\n  \\]\n  \n- **Exploring Strategies:**\n  - **Daily Interest Calculation:** I could calculate the total amount owed day by day until it reaches $20. This seems straightforward but might take time to compute manually for several days.\n  - **Algebraic Approach:** Alternatively, I could set up an equation using the simple interest formula and solve for the number of days required.\n  - **Exponential Growth Observation:** Given the high daily interest rate, I wonder how quickly the amount doubles\u2014perhaps it happens within a few days.\n\n- **Uncertainties:**\n  - **Wait, 15% Per Day?** That sounds quite high. Is it common? I might need to double-check the realism, but since it's part of the problem, I'll proceed with the calculations.\n  - **Checking for Quick Doubling:** Immediately think about whether such a high interest rate would cause the amount to double in a short time\u2014maybe just a couple of days.\n\n**Connecting Thoughts:**\n\n- **Thinking Aloud:** Maybe I should start with the daily calculation to get a feel for how quickly the amount increases. If it seems feasible, I'll continue; otherwise, I'll switch to the algebraic method.\n\n- **Reflecting on Approach:** If calculating day by day takes too long, the algebraic method might be more efficient. But starting with a simple calculation could provide a good check for the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Daily Interest Calculation Approach\n\n**Objective:** Calculate the total amount owed day by day until it reaches at least $20.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Starting Point:** Mark borrows $10. \n- **Daily Interest Rate:** 15% means each day the amount owed increases by 15% of the current total.\n- **Calculation for Each Day:**\n  - Day 1: Total = Principal \u00d7 (1 + Rate) = $10 \u00d7 (1 + 0.15) = $10 \u00d7 1.15 = $11.50\n  - Day 2: Total = $11.50 \u00d7 1.15 = $13.225\n  - Day 3: Total = $13.225 \u00d7 1.15 = $15.20975\n  - Day 4: Total = $15.20975 \u00d7 1.15 = $17.4911625\n  - Day 5: Total = $17.4911625 \u00d7 1.15 \u2248 $20.16484\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **After Day 5:** The amount owed is approximately $20.16, which is just over double the borrowed amount. This seems to align with our goal.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** The calculation shows that within 5 days, the amount owed exceeds $20, which is intuitive given the high daily interest rate.\n- **Checking for Integer Days:** The problem requests the least integer number of days, so rounding up to 5 days is appropriate.\n\n**Realization:**\n\n- **Wait a Moment:** If I continue calculating beyond Day 5, the amount increases significantly. This confirms that the interest compounds rapidly, aligning with the expected outcome for a 15% daily rate.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:**\n\n- **Final Answer from Daily Calculation:** Mark needs at least 5 days to owe Emily at least double the borrowed amount.\n\n**But I'm Not Sure If This Is the Only Way...**\n\n- **Thinking:** Was there a more efficient method? Perhaps an algebraic approach could have provided a quicker solution without manually calculating each day's total.\n\n**Deciding to Explore Another Method:** To ensure accuracy and efficiency, I'll now attempt the algebraic approach.\n\n### Step 2: Algebraic Approach\n\n**Objective:** Set up an equation using the simple interest formula to solve for the required number of days.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Recalling the Formula:** \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Amount} = \\text{Principal} \\times (1 + \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time})\n  \\]\n  \n- **Given:**\n  - Principal = $10\n  - Total Amount Required = $20\n  - Rate = 15% per day = 0.15\n  - Time = Number of days (t)\n\n- **Setting Up the Equation:**\n  \\[\n  20 = 10 \\times (1 + 0.15 \\times t)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving for t:**\n  - Divide both sides by 10:\n    \\[\n    2 = 1 + 0.15t\n    \\]\n    \n  - Subtract 1 from both sides:\n    \\[\n    1 = 0.15t\n    \\]\n    \n  - Divide by 0.15:\n    \\[\n    t = \\frac{1}{0.15} = \\frac{100}{15} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67\n    \\]\n    \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** The calculation suggests that approximately 6.67 days are needed. Since the question asks for the least integer number of days, this rounds up to 7 days.\n- **Checking Consistency with Daily Calculation:** Earlier, the daily method indicated that 5 days were sufficient, but now the algebraic approach suggests 7 days. This discrepancy raises a flag.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\n- **Hmm, Maybe I Misinterpreted the Daily Calculation?** Could it be that the simple interest calculation was off in the daily method? Let me double-check the daily calculation to see where it might have gone wrong.\n\n### Step 3: Revisiting the Daily Calculation\n\n**Objective:** Re-examine the daily interest calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Original Daily Calculation Recap:**\n  - Day 1: $11.50\n  - Day 2: $13.225\n  - Day 3: $15.20975\n  - Day 4: $17.4911625\n  - Day 5: $20.16484\n  \n- **Checking Day 5 Result:**\n  - Total after Day 5: $20.16484\n  - Is this at least double the borrowed amount? Yes, it\u2019s slightly above $20.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **But Wait:** The daily method indicated that 5 days were sufficient, while the algebraic approach suggests 7 days. This inconsistency needs to be resolved.\n\n**Possible Issues:**\n\n- **Daily Method Likely Correct:** Given the straightforward nature of the daily calculation and the high interest rate, it\u2019s plausible that 5 days is indeed correct.\n- **Algebraic Method Maximizing Time:** The algebraic approach might be considering the interest compounding over a longer period, leading to a longer duration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Based on Daily Calculation:** Mark needs at least **5 days** to owe Emily at least double the borrowed amount.\n\n- **However, to ensure accuracy and align with the algebraic method,** I'll proceed with a final check using both methods.\n\n### Final Check: Consistency Between Methods\n\n**Objective:** Verify that both calculation methods align to confirm the accurate number of days.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Comparison of Both Approaches:**\n  - Daily Calculation: 5 days\n  - Algebraic Calculation: Approximately 6.67 days (rounded up to 7 days)\n\n- **Analyzing the Discrepancy:**\n  - **Daily Calculation Advantage:** Given the high daily interest rate, compounding occurs rapidly, possibly leading to an earlier doubling time.\n  - **Algebraic Calculation:** Suggests a more conservative estimate, possibly accounting for fractional days.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Hmm, This is Interesting:** The daily method is straightforward and seems correct based on the calculations, while the algebraic method introduces a fractional day, suggesting that the doubling occurs slightly before 7 days.\n\n**Final Insight:**\n\n- **Realization:** Although the algebraic method indicates almost 7 days, rounding up to 7 makes logical sense since the question asks for the least integer number of days. Therefore, to align with the algebraic approach, the answer should be **7 days**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Final Answer:** Mark must wait at least **7 days** to owe Emily at least double the borrowed amount.\n\n### Final Thought\n\n**Final Check:** After multiple approaches and reflecting on the calculations, it's clear that Mark needs to wait at least **7 days**. While the daily calculation initially suggested 5 days, considering the algebraic method's fractional day and rounding up to the nearest integer ensures the answer meets the problem's requirements.\n\n**Reflection:** This problem highlights the importance of verifying results across different methods to ensure accuracy. Initially, the straightforward daily calculation provided an immediate answer, but cross-checking with the algebraic approach ensured that the final answer was robust and aligned with the problem's parameters.\n\n**Final Insight:** Always be open to re-evaluating your solution approach. Discrepancies between methods can provide valuable insights and ensure the accuracy of your answer.",
