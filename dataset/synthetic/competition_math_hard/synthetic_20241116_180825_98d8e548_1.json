    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, brainstorming different strategies along the way, reflecting often, and checking our work to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, it deals with a **frustum of a right circular cone** formed by removing a smaller cone from a larger one. We're given:\n- The altitude (height) of the frustum is **24 cm**.\n- The area of the **lower base** is **\\(225\\pi\\) sq cm**.\n- The area of the **upper base** is **\\(25\\pi\\) sq cm**.\n\n**Goal:** Find the altitude of the small cone that was cut off.\n\nHonestly, when I see \"frustum\" and areas of bases involved, I immediately think about **proportional relationships in similar figures**. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the only path. Let me brainstorm a bit.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Similar Triangles:**\n   - Since the frustum is part of similar cones, maybe the ratios of corresponding dimensions relate to the areas.\n\n2. **Volume Ratios:**\n   - I recall that the volumes of similar cones are proportional to the cubes of their corresponding heights.\n\n3. **Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   - This could come in handy if I need to relate different height segments, but I don't see an immediate need yet.\n\n4. **Direct Calculation:**\n   - Calculate individual areas and volumes directly if possible, but that seems cumbersome with two unknown heights.\n\n**Reflection:** The **Similar Triangles** approach stands out because we're dealing with **areas of the bases**, which are related to the squares of the radii. If I can establish the relationship between the bases' areas and the heights, this might lead me to the solution.\n\n### **Step 1: Establishing the Relationship Between Areas and Radii**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- The area of a circle is \\(A = \\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius.\n- Given the areas of both bases, I can find the radii.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Lower Base Area:** \n  \\[\n  225\\pi = \\pi r_1^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r_1^2 = 225 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r_1 = \\sqrt{225} = 15 \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n- **Upper Base Area:** \n  \\[\n  25\\pi = \\pi r_2^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r_2^2 = 25 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r_2 = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Wait, does it make sense for the lower base radius to be 15 cm and the upper to be 5 cm? Yes, since the upper base is a section of the larger cone, it should be smaller.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This aligns with the physical intuition of a frustum. The lower base is larger, and the upper base is smaller.\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Similar Triangles Concept**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- The frustum is part of two similar cones. Therefore, the ratio of their heights equals the ratio of their bases' radii.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let the height of the smaller cone be \\(h\\).\n- The total height of the larger cone is \\(24 + h\\).\n- **Ratio of Radii:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\frac{15}{5} = 3\n  \\]\n- **Corresponding Ratio of Heights:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{H}{h} = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad H = 3h\n  \\]\n  \n  But wait, I'm defining \\(H\\) as the entire height of the larger cone, which is \\(24 + h\\). So:\n  \\[\n  3h = 24 + h \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3h - h = 24 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2h = 24 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad h = \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Let me plug this back to see if it makes sense.\n  - If \\(h = 12\\) cm, then the entire height of the larger cone is \\(24 + 12 = 36\\) cm.\n  - The ratio of heights \\( \\frac{36}{12} = 3\\), which matches the ratio of the radii.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems consistent. The ratios align perfectly, suggesting the calculations are on the right track.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Before finalizing, I want to ensure that the Similar Triangles approach is valid here.\n- Since the frustum is formed by removing a smaller cone from a larger one, and both cones are right circular cones, the similarity holds true.\n\n**Check:**\n- The areas of the bases are directly related to the squares of their radii.\n- The ratio of the areas of the bases corresponds to the square of the ratio of their heights.\n- This confirms that the approach is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I'm feeling confident now. The method aligns with geometric principles, and the calculations check out.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\n**Calculations:**\n- The height of the smaller cone that was cut off is \\(h = 12\\) cm.\n\n**Check:**\n- Reassessing the entire process:\n  - Base areas correctly lead to radii.\n  - Similarity ratios correctly relate heights.\n  - All calculations are consistent and check out.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The answer makes sense within the context of the problem. Everything aligns logically, and the final height of the small cone is plausible.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThroughout this process, starting with brainstorming different strategies helped me identify that the **Similar Triangles** approach was the most straightforward for this problem. I made sure to reflect and check each step, ensuring the ratios and calculations were consistent. By verifying the method and continuously checking for consistency, I confidently arrived at the correct height for the small cone.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe altitude of the small cone that was cut off is **12 centimeters**.",

  "ground_truth": "The two bases are circles, and the area of a circle is $\\pi r^2$. If the area of the upper base (which is also the base of the small cone) is $25\\pi$ sq cm, then its radius is $5$ cm, and the radius of the lower base is $15$ cm.   The upper base, therefore, has a radius that is $\\frac{1}{3}$ the size of the radius of the smaller base.  Because the slope of the sides of a cone is uniform, the frustum must have been cut off $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way up the cone, so $x$ is $\\frac13$ of the total height of the cone, $H$.  We can now solve for $x$, because we know that the height of the frustum, $24$ cm is $\\frac23$ of the total height. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2}{3}H&=24\\\\\nH&=36\\\\\nx&=H\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx&=36\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx&=12\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the height of the small cone is $\\boxed{12}$ centimeters."
