    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking my work along the way. It\u2019s important to approach this like a human would, complete with initial thoughts, doubts, and realizations.\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, I see the function:\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{5^x - 1}{5^x + 1} \\]\n\nThe question asks if this function is **even**, **odd**, or **neither**. \n\nImmediately, I remember that even and odd functions have specific symmetries:\n\n- **Even functions** satisfy \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\). So, the graph is symmetric about the y-axis.\n- **Odd functions** satisfy \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\). This means the graph is symmetric about the origin.\n\nBut honestly, looking at the function, I can't recall off the top of my head whether it's even, odd, or neither. \n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Compute \\( f(-x) \\)**: This seems logical. By comparing \\( f(-x) \\) with \\( f(x) \\) and \\(-f(x) \\), I can determine its symmetry.\n  \n2. **Graph the Function**: Maybe plotting it could give me a visual clue about its symmetry.\n\n3. **Check Properties of Exponential Functions**: Since the function involves \\( 5^x \\), perhaps recalling properties of exponential functions could help.\n\nHmm... I think I'll start by computing \\( f(-x) \\). If that gets messy or doesn't lead anywhere, I might consider graphing or exploring exponential properties.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Compute \\( f(-x) \\)**\n\nLet me calculate \\( f(-x) \\):\n\n\\[ f(-x) = \\frac{5^{-x} - 1}{5^{-x} + 1} \\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nAt first glance, this doesn't look like \\( f(x) \\) or \\(-f(x) \\), but maybe there's a relationship I can spot by manipulating it further.\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n\nWait, I know that \\( 5^{-x} \\) can be rewritten using positive exponents:\n\n\\[ 5^{-x} = \\frac{1}{5^x} \\]\n\nSo, substituting that back into \\( f(-x) \\):\n\n\\[ f(-x) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{5^x} - 1}{\\frac{1}{5^x} + 1} \\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\nLet's multiply the numerator and the denominator by \\( 5^x \\) to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[ f(-x) = \\frac{1 - 5^x}{1 + 5^x} \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis expression doesn\u2019t immediately resemble \\( f(x) \\) or \\(-f(x) \\), but it looks somewhat related. \n\n**Thinking Again:**\n\nMaybe I can relate it to \\( f(x) \\). Let\u2019s see if there's a way to express it in terms of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Express \\( f(-x) \\) in Terms of \\( f(x) \\)**\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{5^x - 1}{5^x + 1} \\]\n\nAnd:\n\n\\[ f(-x) = \\frac{1 - 5^x}{1 + 5^x} \\]\n\n**Realization:**\n\nNotice that \\( f(-x) \\) can be rewritten by factoring out \\(-1\\) in the numerator:\n\n\\[ f(-x) = \\frac{-(5^x - 1)}{1 + 5^x} \\]\n\nNow, comparing this with \\( f(x) \\):\n\n\\[ f(-x) = -\\frac{5^x - 1}{1 + 5^x} = -f(x) \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis matches the definition of an **odd function** because \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this suggests that \\( f(x) \\) is odd. But let me double-check by seeing if this holds true for multiple values of \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Verify by Testing Specific Values**\n\nTo be more confident, I'll test a couple of specific values of \\( x \\) to see if \\( f(-x) \\) indeed equals \\(-f(x)\\).\n\n**Test Case 1:**\n\nLet\u2019s take \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ f(1) = \\frac{5^1 - 1}{5^1 + 1} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nNow, \\( f(-1) \\):\n\n\\[ f(-1) = \\frac{5^{-1} - 1}{5^{-1} + 1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{5} - 1}{\\frac{1}{5} + 1} = \\frac{-\\frac{4}{5}}{\\frac{6}{5}} = -\\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, \\( f(-1) = -\\frac{2}{3} \\), which is \\(-f(1)\\). This supports our earlier conclusion.\n\n**Test Case 2:**\n\nLet\u2019s check \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ f(0) = \\frac{5^0 - 1}{5^0 + 1} = \\frac{1 - 1}{1 + 1} = 0 \\]\n\nNow, \\( f(-0) \\):\n\n\\[ f(-0) = f(0) = 0 \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis is consistent because \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\) when \\( f(x) = 0 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth test cases align with our conclusion that \\( f(x) \\) is an odd function. \n\nBut let me perform another quick check to ensure everything flows correctly.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Quick Verification of the Approach**\n\n**Did computing \\( f(-x) \\) lead me to the correct conclusion?**\n\nYes, initially, \\( f(-x) \\) didn't look like \\( f(x) \\) or \\(-f(x) \\), but by factoring out \\(-1\\), I connected it to \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Is there an alternative method I should consider?**\n\nGraphing could provide a visual confirmation, but given that the algebraic approach is already clear, I think we're good without it.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\nChecking specific values was helpful in reinforcing the conclusion. It\u2019s always a good idea to verify with examples.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nThe function \\( f(x) \\) satisfies the condition for being an odd function because \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\). This conclusion is consistent across different strategies and checks.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\text{odd} \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThrough calculating \\( f(-x) \\) and expressing it in terms of \\( f(x) \\), along with verifying specific cases, I've determined that the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{5^x - 1}{5^x + 1} \\) is an **odd function**.",
