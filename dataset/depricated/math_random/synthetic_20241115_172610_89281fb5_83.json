    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies and reflecting on each step, just like I would if I were solving it manually. Let's see where this takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about forming different positive two-digit integers using the digits 2, 4, and 7 without repeating any digit in an integer. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Simple Combinations:** Maybe I can think about all possible combinations of these digits.\n- **Permutations:** Since the order of digits matters (e.g., 24 is different from 42), permutations might be relevant.\n- **Exclusion of Single Digits:** Waiting a minute\u2014since we're forming two-digit numbers, single digits like '2', '4', or '7' alone shouldn\u2019t count, so that's good.\n  \nAt first, I feel like permutations might be the right route because the order matters\u2014like, 24 is different from 42.\n\n**But wait...**\n\nCould there be an easier way? Maybe listing them out could help visualize. I\u2019ll try that and see if it aligns with the combinatorial approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach 1: Listing All Possible Two-Digit Numbers**\n\n**What I'm Thinking:**\nLet\u2019s list all two-digit combinations using 2, 4, and 7. This way, I can ensure I\u2019m counting correctly without missing any.\n\n**Step 1: Possible Digits for Each Place**\n- **Tens Place:** Can be 2, 4, or 7\n- **Units Place:** Can be any of the remaining two digits\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis makes sense because the first digit determines the tens place, leaving two options for the units place.\n\n**Step 2: Generate All Combinations**\n- **Tens = 2:** Units can be 4 or 7 \u2192 24, 27\n- **Tens = 4:** Units can be 2 or 7 \u2192 42, 47\n- **Tens = 7:** Units can be 2 or 4 \u2192 72, 74\n\n**Quick Check:**\nSo far, I have: **24, 27, 42, 47, 72, 74**. That\u2019s six numbers. Does that seem right? Let\u2019s keep going to be sure.\n\n**Step 3: Verify Uniqueness**\n- Each number is unique and uses two different digits.\n\n**Reflection:**\nListing them out seems effective. No duplicates, and all combinations are covered.\n\n**But...**\n\nIs there a faster way to confirm this without manually listing?\n\n---\n\n### **Approach 2: Using Permutations to Count**\n\n**What I'm Thinking:**\nMaybe I can use a permutation formula to calculate the number of valid two-digit integers without listing them all.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding Permutations for This Case**\n- **Total Digits Available:** 3 (2, 4, 7)\n- **Digits to Choose for Each Number:** 2 (since it\u2019s a two-digit number)\n- **Order Matters:** Yes, because 24 \u2260 42\n\n**Step 2: Applying Permutation Formula**\n- The number of permutations of selecting 2 digits from 3 is \\( P(3, 2) \\).\n\n\\[\nP(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(3, 2) = \\frac{3!}{(3 - 2)!} = \\frac{6}{1} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, this gives me **6** permutations, which matches the six numbers I listed. That\u2019s reassuring.\n\n**Step 3: Matching Both Approaches**\n- **Listing Approach:** 24, 27, 42, 47, 72, 74 \u2192 Total: 6\n- **Permutation Approach:** P(3, 2) = 6\n\n**Check:**\nBoth methods agree, so the count seems accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach 3: Verifying by Contradiction**\n\n**What I'm Thinking:**\nLet\u2019s ensure there are no overcounts or undercounts by considering potential errors.\n\n**Step 1: Possible Mistake\u2014Repetition**\n- **Given:** A digit may not be repeated within an integer. \n- **Check:** Have I accidentally included any single-digit numbers or repeated digits? \u2192 No, all listed numbers are two-digit with unique digits.\n\n**Step 2: Boundary Cases**\n- **Single Digit Exclusion:** Only two-digit numbers are considered, so single digits (2, 4, 7) are rightly ignored.\n  \n**Reflection:**\nEverything seems in order. No extra cases to worry about.\n\n**But...**\n\nCould there be a two-digit combination I've missed?\n\n**Quick Check:**\nList again: 24, 27, 42, 47, 72, 74 \u2192 Looks complete. No omissions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014listing all combinations, using permutations, and verifying by checking for contradictions\u2014all approaches consistently point to the **same answer: 6** different positive two-digit integers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Total Different Two-Digit Integers:** **6**\n- **List:** 24, 27, 42, 47, 72, 74\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- **Cross-Verification:** Using multiple methods (listing and permutations) helped confirm the accuracy.\n- **Error Checking:** Reflecting often and checking for contradictions ensured no overcounts or undercounts.\n- **Confidence in Answer:** The agreement across different approaches gives confidence that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Total number of different positive two-digit integers:** **6**\n\n**List of Integers:** 24, 27, 42, 47, 72, 74\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with brainstorming, exploring various strategies, and constant reflection, mimics natural human problem-solving. It ensures that every possibility is considered, and any potential mistake is caught and corrected early on.",
