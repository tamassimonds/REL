    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it like I would if I were tackling it in real time, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my methods as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the question is about determining the maximum number of planes that can be formed by 12 points in space, given that a plane is uniquely defined by three non-collinear points. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Combinatorial Approach:** Maybe I can use combinations to select sets of three points out of twelve. That would give me the number of possible planes.\n- **Geometric Consideration:** But wait, not all sets of three points will define unique planes. If three points are collinear, they lie on the same line, and thus, they only define one plane. So, I need to consider collinearity.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Perhaps I can think in terms of dimensions and see how many planes can exist relative to points in higher dimensions.\n\nHmm, the combinatorial approach seems straightforward, but I'm worried about overcounting planes that don't actually exist due to collinearity. Let me explore this further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Combinatorial Approach**\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\nI know that in general, the number of ways to choose three points from twelve is given by combinations, denoted as \\( \\binom{n}{3} \\). So,\n\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 220\n\\]\n\nOkay, so there are **220** possible sets of three points. But wait, this assumes all sets define unique planes. Do I need to account for collinearity?\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nYes, I definitely need to consider collinearity. If any three points out of the selected set lie on the same line, they don\u2019t form a unique plane. So, the simple combination calculation doesn't capture the reality.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combinatorial approach needs refinement to account for collinear points. Let\u2019s think of another strategy to incorporate this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering Collinearity**\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\nOkay, to adjust for collinearity, I need to know how many sets of three points are collinear. If I can subtract these from the total combinations, I\u2019ll get the number of unique planes.\n\n**Possible Strategy:**\n\n- **Identify Collinear Sets:** Determine how many sets of three points lie on the same line.\n- **Subtract from Total:** Subtract these from the total number of combinations to find the maximum number of unique planes.\n\n**Challenging Part:**\n\nWait, I don\u2019t have information about which points are collinear. The problem doesn\u2019t specify, so I can't directly calculate the number of collinear sets.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nHmm, without specific information about collinearity among the 12 points, it's tricky to adjust the total directly. This suggests that perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum possible number of unique planes under the best-case scenario\u2014that is, no three points are collinear.\n\n**Hmm, let me think if that's correct...**\n\nIf under the maximum condition, all sets of three points are non-collinear, then my initial combinatorial calculation holds. But I need to ensure that this interpretation aligns with the problem's requirement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nYes, if the points are arranged such that no three are collinear, the maximum number of unique planes is simply the total number of combinations, which we've calculated as 220.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes it make sense that with 12 points, the maximum number of planes is 220 if all sets of three are non-collinear?\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Mathematical Validity:** The combination formula used is correct for selecting sets of three.\n- **Logical Consistency:** Assuming no three points are collinear is a valid condition for maximum uniqueness.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\nBut what if some points are collinear? The actual number of planes would decrease. However, the problem asks for the maximum possible number, so considering the worst-case scenario (all sets are unique) is appropriate.\n\n**Wait, am I missing something?**\n\nI think I'm on the right track. The question asks for the maximum, so assuming no collinearity is correct for this specific query.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe maximum possible number of planes, assuming no three points are collinear, is indeed 220.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Double-Checking my Work**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me pause and consider whether there are any other factors I might have overlooked.\n\n- **Higher-Dimensional Considerations:** The problem is in three-dimensional space, so higher-dimensional planes don\u2019t apply here.\n- **Additional Constraints:** The only constraint mentioned is non-collinearity among three points to define a plane.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nGiven that, and having accounted for collinearity by considering the maximum case, I\u2019m confident in the answer.\n\n**Possible Realization:**\n\nAh, I could explore different configurations to see if there are scenarios where fewer planes exist, but since the question asks for the maximum, it's sufficient to assume the ideal case.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNo additional complexities are needed. The maximum number of planes is 220.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, adjusting for collinearity, and verifying my approach, the maximum possible number of planes that can be determined by 12 points in space is **220**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Brainstorming Helped:** Initially, I considered a straightforward combinatorial approach but realized the need to account for collinearity.\n- **Checking Was Crucial:** Throughout, I reflected on whether each step made sense and adjusted my strategy accordingly.\n- **Confidence in the Answer:** By ensuring all possibilities were considered and verifying each step, I'm confident that 220 is the correct maximum.\n\nThis approach resembles human problem-solving, where brainstorming leads to initial solutions, checking ensures correctness, and reflection helps maintain the right direction.",
