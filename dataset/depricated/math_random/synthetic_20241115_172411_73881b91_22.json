    "working_out": "Absolutely, let\u2019s dive into this problem just like I would if I were working through it myself. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming and exploring different strategies, reflecting frequently, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question, a few things strike me:\n\n- **Shape and Properties:** We\u2019re dealing with a square, which has all sides equal and all angles right angles. The center is given, which is helpful for determining the vertices.\n  \n- **Dilation:** The square is dilated with center at (0,0) and a scale factor of 2. Dilation typically changes the size of a shape while maintaining its proportions, and since the center is at the origin, the square will enlarge symmetrically around (0,0).\n\n- **Goal:** We need to find the coordinates of the vertex of the image that is farthest from the origin after dilation.\n\nInitially, I think about recalling how dilation works, especially since the center is at the origin. It reminds me of problems involving scaling geometric figures. However, I\u2019m not entirely sure how to apply this directly to find the farthest vertex, so I might need to explore a bit.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Determine the Original Vertices:**\n   - Calculate the coordinates of the square's vertices before dilation using its center and area.\n\n2. **Apply Dilation to the Vertices:**\n   - Use the dilation formula to find the new coordinates of each vertex after scaling.\n\n3. **Find the Farthest Vertex from the Origin:**\n   - Calculate the distances of the dilated vertices from the origin and identify the maximum.\n\nAt first glance, this seems like a straightforward path: find the original vertices, apply dilation, and then determine which vertex is farthest. But I wonder if there might be a more intuitive or quicker way, perhaps by considering the properties of dilation and the square's geometry.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Determining the Original Vertices**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the coordinates of the square\u2019s vertices, I need to understand how a square is positioned relative to its center. Since the square is centered at \\((8, -8)\\) and is horizontal with a given area of 4 square units, I can calculate the length of each side and then find the vertices.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Area of Square:** \\( \\text{Area} = \\text{side length}^2 \\)\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{side length}^2 = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{side length} = \\sqrt{4} = 2\n  \\]\n\n- **Half Side Length:** Since the square is centered at \\((8, -8)\\), each vertex is at a distance of half the side length from the center.\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{side length}}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n  \\]\n\n- **Vertices:**\n\n  - Top side: Move 1 unit up and down from the center.\n    - \\( (8, -8 + 1) = (8, -7) \\)\n    - \\( (8, -8 - 1) = (8, -9) \\)\n  \n  - Left side: Move 1 unit left and right from the center.\n    - \\( (8 - 1, -8) = (7, -8) \\)\n    - \\( (8 + 1, -8) = (9, -8) \\)\n\nSo, the vertices of the square are:\n- \\( A(7, -7) \\)\n- \\( B(9, -7) \\)\n- \\( C(9, -9) \\)\n- \\( D(7, -9) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me double-check this. Since the square is horizontal, moving up and down would give the top and bottom vertices, but I mixed up the left and right. I should have moved left and right for the top and bottom vertices. Let me correct that.\n\n**Corrected Vertices:**\n\n- Top side: \\( (8 - 1, -8 + 1) = (7, -7) \\) and \\( (8 + 1, -8 + 1) = (9, -7) \\)\n- Bottom side: \\( (8 - 1, -8 - 1) = (7, -9) \\) and \\( (8 + 1, -8 - 1) = (9, -9) \\)\n\nSo, the corrected vertices are:\n- \\( A(7, -7) \\)\n- \\( B(9, -7) \\)\n- \\( C(9, -9) \\)\n- \\( D(7, -9) \\)\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, the top and bottom vertices are at \\( y = -7 \\) and \\( y = -9 \\) respectively, which aligns with the square's orientation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Dilation to the Vertices**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to apply the dilation with center at \\((0,0)\\) and scale factor of 2. Dilation changes each point\u2019s distance from the center proportionally. Since the center is at the origin, the coordinates of each vertex will be multiplied by the scale factor.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Dilation Formula:**\n\n  \\[\n  (x, y) \\rightarrow (k \\times x, k \\times y)\n  \\]\n  \n  where \\( k \\) is the scale factor.\n\n- **Applying Dilation to Each Vertex:**\n\n  - \\( A(7, -7) \\rightarrow (2 \\times 7, 2 \\times -7) = (14, -14) \\)\n  - \\( B(9, -7) \\rightarrow (2 \\times 9, 2 \\times -7) = (18, -14) \\)\n  - \\( C(9, -9) \\rightarrow (2 \\times 9, 2 \\times -9) = (18, -18) \\)\n  - \\( D(7, -9) \\rightarrow (2 \\times 7, 2 \\times -9) = (14, -18) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this seem correct? Multiplying each coordinate by 2 should enlarge the square symmetrically around the origin. Let me think about it: since the center of dilation is at the origin, this makes sense. The vertices are moving away from the origin, which aligns with the properties of dilation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying the Farthest Vertex from the Origin**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the coordinates of the dilated vertices, I need to find which one is farthest from the origin \\((0,0)\\). This involves calculating the distance of each vertex from the origin and determining the maximum.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Distance Formula:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating Distances:**\n\n  - For \\( A(14, -14) \\):\n  \n    \\[\n    \\sqrt{14^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 196} = \\sqrt{392} \\approx 19.8\n    \\]\n  \n  - For \\( B(18, -14) \\):\n  \n    \\[\n    \\sqrt{18^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{324 + 196} = \\sqrt{520} \\approx 22.8\n    \\]\n  \n  - For \\( C(18, -18) \\):\n  \n    \\[\n    \\sqrt{18^2 + (-18)^2} = \\sqrt{324 + 324} = \\sqrt{648} \\approx 25.5\n    \\]\n  \n  - For \\( D(14, -18) \\):\n  \n    \\[\n    \\sqrt{14^2 + (-18)^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 324} = \\sqrt{520} \\approx 22.8\n    \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me check these calculations. Specifically, \\( A(14, -14) \\) and \\( D(14, -18) \\) both have \\( x = 14 \\), so their distances should differ only by the \\( y \\)-coordinate. That makes sense because the square has been dilated, and \\( D \\) is lower on the \\( y \\)-axis, so it should be farther.\n\n**Corrected Distances:**\n\nActually, my initial thought about the distances is correct. Here they are again:\n\n- \\( A(14, -14) \\): \\(\\sqrt{392} \\approx 19.8\\)\n- \\( B(18, -14) \\): \\(\\sqrt{520} \\approx 22.8\\)\n- \\( C(18, -18) \\): \\(\\sqrt{648} \\approx 25.5\\)\n- \\( D(14, -18) \\): \\(\\sqrt{520} \\approx 22.8\\)\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, \\( C(18, -18) \\) has the largest distance, which aligns with being the farthest vertex from the origin.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter determining the coordinates of the dilated vertices and calculating their distances from the origin, the vertex farthest from the origin is:\n\n\\[\nC(18, -18)\n\\]\n\nSo, the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square \\( ABCD \\) that is farthest from the origin are \\( \\boxed{(18, -18)} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nLooking back at the entire process:\n\n- **Determining the Original Vertices:** Initially mixed up the orientation but corrected it by moving left/right for top/bottom vertices.\n\n- **Applying Dilation:** Correctly applied the dilation formula, considering the center at the origin.\n\n- **Finding the Farthest Vertex:** Calculated distances accurately, confirming that \\( C(18, -18) \\) is indeed the farthest.\n\nThroughout, I checked and reflected on each step, ensuring the approach made sense and adjusting whenever something didn\u2019t seem right. This methodical approach helped arrive at the correct solution confidently.\n\n---\n\n**What I Would Do Differently in Real Life:**\n\nIf I were working through this problem in real life, I might not have caught the initial mix-up with the vertex coordinates right away. It\u2019s common to make small errors, so reflecting frequently and being open to correcting mistakes is crucial. Additionally, verifying each step with a quick check (like ensuring the properties of dilation are satisfied) can help catch errors early.\n\nThis human-like thinking process\u2014complete with brainstorming, checking, reflecting, and adjusting\u2014ensures that the solution is accurate and thorough.\n\nAhh, I see I've made a mistake in my previous solution. Let's revisit the problem and work through it step-by-step, ensuring a correct and thorough approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting the Problem**\n\n**User's Request:**\nSquare \\( ABCD \\) has its center at \\( (8, -8) \\) and an area of 4 square units. The top side of the square is horizontal. The square is dilated with the center at \\( (0, 0) \\) and a scale factor of 2. What are the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square \\( ABCD \\) that is farthest from the origin?\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection on Previous Approach**\n\nIn my initial solution, I determined the vertices of the square after dilation and calculated their distances from the origin. However, I mistakenly identified the farthest vertex. Now, upon reviewing, I realize that I need to reconsider the dilation process and verify the correctness of my calculations. Let's brainstorm different strategies to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Determine the Original Vertices Correctly:**\n   - Utilize the properties of squares to find the correct coordinates of the vertices based on the given center and area.\n\n2. **Apply Dilation Accurately:**\n   - Ensure the dilation formula is applied correctly to each vertex.\n\n3. **Calculate Distances from the Origin:**\n   - Compute the distances of the dilated vertices from the origin to identify the farthest one.\n\n4. **Verifying Each Step:**\n   - Continuously check each step to catch any errors early.\n\nAt this point, I realize that accurately determining the original vertices is crucial. Let's dive into that step again.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Correctly Determining the Original Vertices**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the coordinates of square \\( ABCD \\), I need to consider its center and the length of its sides derived from the given area.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Area of Square:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\text{side length}^2 = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{side length} = \\sqrt{4} = 2\n  \\]\n\n- **Vertices Relative to the Center \\( (8, -8) \\):**\n\n  Since the square is horizontal:\n  \n  - **Half Side Length:**  \n    \\(\\frac{2}{2} = 1\\)\n    \n  - **Top Side:**  \n    Move 1 unit up and down from the center:\n    - \\( (8 - 1, -8 + 1) = (7, -7) \\)  \n    - \\( (8 + 1, -8 + 1) = (9, -7) \\)\n  \n  - **Bottom Side:**  \n    Move 1 unit down and up from the center:\n    - \\( (8 - 1, -8 - 1) = (7, -9) \\)  \n    - \\( (8 + 1, -8 - 1) = (9, -9) \\)\n  \n  **Vertices:**\n  - \\( A(7, -7) \\)\n  - \\( B(9, -7) \\)\n  - \\( C(9, -9) \\)\n  - \\( D(7, -9) \\)\n\n**Correction:**\n\nIn my previous solution, I mixed up the orientation. The top side of the square should align with the horizontal axis, which means moving left/right for vertical sides. This correction aligns with the user's description.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, the top and bottom vertices are at \\( y = -7 \\) and \\( y = -9 \\), respectively.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Dilation Accurately**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to apply the dilation with the center at \\( (0, 0) \\) and a scale factor of 2. Dilation enlarges the square symmetrically around the origin.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Dilation Formula:**  \n  \\[\n  (x, y) \\rightarrow (k \\times x, k \\times y)\n  \\]\n  where \\( k = 2 \\).\n  \n- **Applying Dilation to Each Vertex:**\n\n  - \\( A(7, -7) \\rightarrow (2 \\times 7, 2 \\times -7) = (14, -14) \\)\n  - \\( B(9, -7) \\rightarrow (2 \\times 9, 2 \\times -7) = (18, -14) \\)\n  - \\( C(9, -9) \\rightarrow (2 \\times 9, 2 \\times -9) = (18, -18) \\)\n  - \\( D(7, -9) \\rightarrow (2 \\times 7, 2 \\times -9) = (14, -18) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this seem correct? Yes, each vertex's coordinates are multiplied by the scale factor, moving them away from the origin.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying the Farthest Vertex from the Origin**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to calculate the distances of the dilated vertices from the origin to find the farthest one.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Distance Formula:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculating Distances:**\n\n  - \\( A(14, -14) \\):  \n    \\[\n    \\sqrt{14^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 196} = \\sqrt{392} \\approx 19.8\n    \\]\n  \n  - \\( B(18, -14) \\):  \n    \\[\n    \\sqrt{18^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{324 + 196} = \\sqrt{520} \\approx 22.8\n    \\]\n  \n  - \\( C(18, -18) \\):  \n    \\[\n    \\sqrt{18^2 + (-18)^2} = \\sqrt{324 + 324} = \\sqrt{648} \\approx 25.5\n    \\]\n  \n  - \\( D(14, -18) \\):  \n    \\[\n    \\sqrt{14^2 + (-18)^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 324} = \\sqrt{520} \\approx 22.8\n    \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a moment! The distance for \\( C(18, -18) \\) is approximately 25.5, which is indeed the farthest compared to the other vertices. This aligns with the square's properties after dilation.\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs \\( C(18, -18) \\) the farthest vertex? Yes, it has the largest distance from the origin.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter accurately determining the vertices, applying dilation, and calculating the distances, the vertex farthest from the origin is:\n\n\\[\nC(18, -18)\n\\]\n\nSo, the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square \\( ABCD \\) that is farthest from the origin are \\( \\boxed{(18, -18)} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nLooking back at the entire process:\n\n- **Correcting Vertex Determination:** Initially, I misaligned the square's orientation. Correcting this ensured accurate vertex coordinates.\n\n- **Accurate Dilation Application:** Applying the dilation formula correctly moved each vertex proportionally away from the origin.\n\n- **Determining the Farthest Vertex:** Calculating the distances confirmed that \\( C(18, -18) \\) is indeed the farthest.\n\nThroughout, frequent checking and reflection helped catch and correct errors, ensuring a precise solution. By maintaining an open mindset and being willing to adjust my approach, I reached the correct answer confidently.\n\n---\n\n**What I Would Do Differently in Real Life:**\n\nIf I were working through this problem in real life, I might not have caught the initial mix-up with the vertex coordinates right away.
