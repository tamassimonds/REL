    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem by emulating human-like thinking. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check for correctness, and adjust my approach as needed. It's essential to think out loud, make mistakes, and have those \"aha moments\" to navigate through the problem effectively.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the equation:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2}}{\\sqrt{16 + 9}}\n\\]\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- **Familiarity:** This reminds me of the Pythagorean theorem, where you calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the squares of the other two sides.\n- **Is it Simplifiable?** I wonder if both the numerator and denominator can be simplified individually before dividing.\n- **Fraction Simplification:** Maybe simplifying the fractions step by step would make it clearer.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Simplify Numerator and Denominator Separately:** Calculate the squares and square roots individually.\n2. **Pythagorean Theorem Insight:** Use the idea of right triangles to simplify the expression.\n3. **Factor Out Common Terms:** See if there's a common factor that can simplify the fraction immediately.\n\n**Reflection:** Simplifying both parts separately seems straightforward. If that doesn't work out neatly, I can explore other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Simplify Numerator and Denominator Separately**\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Numerator**\n\n\\[\n5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169\n\\]\n\nWait a moment... **Signal Check:** 169 is a perfect square.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{169} = 13\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Okay, that worked perfectly. The numerator simplifies to 13. This aligns with the Pythagorean theorem, where 5 and 12 are the legs, and 13 is the hypotenuse.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Denominator**\n\n\\[\n16 + 9 = 25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Simple addition here. Let's take the square root.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{25} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Both parts simplified nicely. Let me plug these back into the fraction.\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{13}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, it's a common fraction, and both numerator and denominator simplified correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Verify Using Pythagorean Insight**\n\n**Alternative Approach:** Given that 5 and 12 relate to the Pythagorean theorem, I could have recognized that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Hypotenuse}}{\\text{Leg}} = \\frac{13}{5} = \\frac{r}{1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, the ratio remains \\(\\frac{13}{5}\\), confirming our simplification.\n\n**Thoughts:** This reinforces our earlier result. It's always good to verify using different methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Factor Out Common Terms**\n\n**Attempting to Factor:** Wait, let me see if there's a common factor before simplifying.\n\n**Observation:** The numerator becomes 13 (since \\(\\sqrt{169} = 13\\)) and the denominator is 5. There's no common factor to reduce further.\n\n**Reflection:** This approach doesn't simplify the fraction further, but that's okay since \\(\\frac{13}{5}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Verification**\n\n**Check 1:** Does \\(\\frac{13}{5}\\) simplify further? No, 13 and 5 have no common factors besides 1.\n\n**Check 2:** Re-evaluating the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n5^2 + 12^2 = 169 \\quad (\\sqrt{169} = 13)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Thus, } r = \\frac{13}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Everything aligns perfectly. The numerator and denominator simplified correctly, and alternative methods verified the ratio.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014simplifying both parts separately, verifying using Pythagorean insights, and attempting to factor out common terms\u2014I arrived at the same solution consistently:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{13}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:** The initial approach worked well, and cross-verifying with alternative methods confirmed the correctness. It's always helpful to check your work through multiple strategies, ensuring accuracy and deepening understanding.\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through each step, reflecting on the process, and checking the work frequently, I've confidently arrived at the solution.",
