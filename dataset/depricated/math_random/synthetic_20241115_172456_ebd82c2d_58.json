It's essential to explore various pathways, reflect often, and adjust the approach as needed\u2014just like how I would tackle a problem manually.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, it mentions the circumcenter \\( O \\) and orthocenter \\( H \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\). I remember from geometry that the circumcenter is the center of the circumscribed circle, and the orthocenter is where all three altitudes intersect. The relationship between these two points is intriguing.\n\nThe given information includes:\n- Circumradius \\( R = 7 \\)\n- \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 \\)\n\nI recall that there are certain formulas relating the distances between these centers and the sides or angles of the triangle. However, I can't immediately remember the exact formula connecting \\( OH^2 \\) with the given variables.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Distance Formula between O and H:**\n   There's a known formula:\n   \\[\n   OH^2 = 9R^2 - a^2 - b^2 - c^2\n   \\]\n   This looks promising since it directly relates \\( OH^2 \\) to \\( R \\) and \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\).\n\n2. **Exploring Alternative Formulas:**\n   Perhaps there's another formula involving angles or specific properties of the triangle's centers. I might need to consider the Euler line or other properties if the first formula doesn't work out.\n\n3. **Check for Additional Constraints:**\n   Given that \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\) is provided, maybe there's a connection with the Law of Cosines or other trigonometric identities.\n\n### **Approach Selection**\n\nThe first strategy using the formula \\( OH^2 = 9R^2 - a^2 - b^2 - c^2 \\) seems the most direct since it requires only the provided values without needing additional information.\n\nLet's proceed with this approach and see if it leads us to the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Formula**\n\nGiven:\n- \\( R = 7 \\)\n- \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 \\)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nOH^2 = 9(7)^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( 9(7)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n9 \\times 49 = 441\n\\]\n\nNow subtract \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 \\):\n\n\\[\nOH^2 = 441 - 29 = 412\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection and Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's quickly check if this makes sense:\n\n- **Unit Check:** The answer is in squared units, which aligns with \\( OH^2 \\) being a length squared.\n- **Magnitude Check:** \\( 441 - 29 = 412 \\) seems reasonable given \\( R = 7 \\).\n\nEverything looks correct so far. However, to ensure robustness, let's consider another approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Verifying with Euler's Line**\n\nEuler's line theorem states that in any triangle, the circumcenter \\( O \\), centroid \\( G \\), and orthocenter \\( H \\) are collinear, with specific distances between them. While this might not directly provide \\( OH^2 \\), it can help verify our result.\n\n**But wait:** This theorem involves the centroid, which isn't provided here. So perhaps Euler's line isn't directly applicable without additional information.\n\n**Conclusion:** The initial formula seems to be the most straightforward and appropriate for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought**\n\nAfter applying the formula and verifying its correctness, I confidently conclude that:\n\n\\[\nOH^2 = 412\n\\]\n\nThis solution aligns with the initial approach and passes both unit and magnitude checks. Therefore, the distance squared between the circumcenter and orthocenter of triangle \\( ABC \\) is **412**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Confusion:** At first, I couldn't recall the exact formula connecting \\( OH^2 \\) with \\( R \\) and the side lengths. This led me to brainstorm and search for related formulas.\n- **Realization:** Recognizing the direct formula \\( OH^2 = 9R^2 - a^2 - b^2 - c^2 \\) was crucial. It provided a straightforward path to the solution.\n- **Verification Steps:** Checking the units and magnitudes ensured the answer's validity.\n\nThroughout the process, I explored different strategies, reflected on their applicability, and adjusted my approach as needed\u2014just like a human would when faced with a problem.",
