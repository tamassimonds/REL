    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n- **Circle \\( B \\) has its center at \\((-6, 2)\\) and a radius of \\(10\\) units.**\n- **I need to find the sum of the \\( y \\)-coordinates of the two points on circle \\( B \\) that are also on the \\( y \\)-axis.**\n\nAt first glance, this feels like a geometry problem involving circles and their intersections with axes. When I see \"points on circle \\( B \\) that are also on the \\( y \\)-axis,\" I think about where the circle intersects the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Circle Equation Method:**  \n   Maybe I can use the standard equation of a circle to find the intersection points.\n\n2. **Geometric Visualization:**  \n   Visualizing the circle and the \\( y \\)-axis might help me see where they intersect.\n\n3. **Coordinate Substitution:**  \n   Since the \\( y \\)-axis has \\( x = 0 \\), I could substitute this into the circle's equation.\n\nI think starting with the **Circle Equation Method** makes sense because it directly relates the properties of the circle to the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Writing the Equation of Circle \\( B \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo find the intersection points, I need the equation of circle \\( B \\). The general form is:\n\n\\[\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nGiven:\n- Center \\((-6, 2)\\) \u21d2 \\( h = -6 \\), \\( k = 2 \\)\n- Radius \\( r = 10 \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x + 6)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 100\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat seems correct. This equation represents circle \\( B \\) with the given center and radius.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding Intersection Points with the \\( y \\)-Axis**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe \\( y \\)-axis is where \\( x = 0 \\). To find the points where circle \\( B \\) intersects the \\( y \\)-axis, I can substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the circle's equation.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nSubstituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the circle equation:\n\n\\[\n(0 + 6)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n36 + (y - 2)^2 = 100\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 36 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n(y - 2)^2 = 64\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[\ny - 2 = \\pm 8\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\ny - 2 = 8 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 10\n\\]\n\\[\ny - 2 = -8 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = -6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI have two \\( y \\)-coordinates: \\( 10 \\) and \\( -6 \\). That makes sense because circles can intersect the \\( y \\)-axis at two points unless they're tangent.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet's quickly verify:\n\n\\[\n(0 + 6)^2 + (10 - 2)^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 \\quad \u2713\n\\]\n\\[\n(0 + 6)^2 + (-6 - 2)^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 \\quad \u2713\n\\]\n\nBoth points satisfy the circle's equation. Looks good!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Sum of the \\( y \\)-Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have both \\( y \\)-coordinates, I just need to add them together to find the sum.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n10 + (-6) = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the sum of the \\( y \\)-coordinates is \\( 4 \\). This makes sense numerically\u2014adding \\( 10 \\) and \\( -6 \\) gives \\( 4 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me quickly double-check:\n\n\\[\n10 + (-6) = 10 - 6 = 4\n\\]\n\nYep, that\u2019s correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThe approach seems to have worked well:\n\n1. **Defined the Circle's Equation:**  \n   This was straightforward given the center and radius.\n\n2. **Found Intersection Points:**  \n   Substituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the circle's equation gave me the \\( y \\)-coordinates.\n\n3. **Calculated the Sum:**  \n   Adding the two \\( y \\)-coordinates together provided the final answer.\n\nOverall, thinking through each step and checking along the way ensured the solution was correct. If something had felt off, I would have revisited my circle equation or the substitution step, but everything lined up perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe sum of the \\( y \\)-coordinates of the two points on circle \\( B \\) that are also on the \\( y \\)-axis is **4**.",

Therefore, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the two points on circle $B$ that are also on the $y$-axis is $\\boxed{4}$."
