    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to ensure correctness, and adjust my approach as needed. It\u2019s important to think through each step naturally, just like I would when tackling a problem manually.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^6 - 16x^3 + 64}{x^3 - 8}\n\\]\n\n1. **Initial Reaction**: This looks like a rational expression involving polynomials. \n   \n2. **Possible Strategies**:\n   - **Factorization**: Maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator to see if anything cancels out.\n   - **Substitution**: Since \\(x = 6\\) is given, perhaps substituting directly would simplify things.\n   - **Long Division**: If factoring doesn't work, maybe polynomial long division could help.\n   - **Evaluate Directly**: Just plug in \\(x = 6\\) and see if that gives a straightforward answer.\n\n3. **Uncertainty**: Factoring might be useful, but I'm not immediately seeing a clear factorization. Let's explore a bit.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Factorization Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process**:\n\n- **Recognize Patterns**: \n   - The numerator is \\(x^6 - 16x^3 + 64\\). \n   - Notice that \\(16 = 4^2\\) and \\(64 = 4^3\\). \n   - The middle term is \\(-16x^3\\), which is \\(-4^2x^3\\).\n\n- **Possible Approach**: \n   - This reminds me of a quadratic in terms of \\(x^3\\):\n     \\[\n     (x^3)^2 - 4 \\times (x^3) + 4^2\n     \\]\n   - That looks like a perfect square trinomial:\n     \\[\n     (x^3 - 4)^2\n     \\]\n   \n**Calculation**:\n\n\\[\nx^6 - 16x^3 + 64 = (x^3)^2 - 2 \\times 4 \\times x^3 + 4^2 = (x^3 - 4)^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**:\n\n- **Wait a Second**: \n  - If this is \\((x^3 - 4)^2\\), then the numerator factors nicely.\n  - This could simplify the expression significantly.\n\n- **Recognizing Mistake**: \n  - Ah, but wait! I initially thought it might be \\((x^3 - 4)^2\\), but let's check. \n  - Expanding \\((x^3 - 4)^2\\) gives:\n    \\[\n    x^6 - 8x^3 + 16\n    \\]\n  - That doesn't match our original numerator. So my initial factoring attempt was incorrect.\n\n- **Adjusting Strategy**: \n  - Maybe I misread the pattern. \n  - Let's rethink: Could there be another pattern or perhaps a combination of factoring techniques?\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting Factorization with a Different Approach**\n\n**New Idea**:\n\n- **Consider Substitution**: \n  - Let \\(y = x^3\\). Then the expression becomes:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{y^2 - 16y + 64}{y - 8}\n    \\]\n  - This looks like a quadratic in terms of \\(y\\).\n\n**Factoring the Quadratic**:\n\n- **Numerator**: \n  \\[\n  y^2 - 16y + 64\n  \\]\n- **Checking for Perfect Square**: \n  - \\(64 = 8^2\\)\n  - So, \\(y^2 - 16y + 64 = (y - 8)^2\\)\n\n**Verification**:\n\n\\[\n(y - 8)^2 = y^2 - 16y + 64\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**:\n\n- **Hmm, This Works**: \n  - The numerator factors neatly into \\((y - 8)^2\\).\n  - This is a clean factorization.\n\n- **Confirming Factorization**: \n  - The numerator becomes \\((x^3 - 8)^2\\) when substituting back \\(y = x^3\\).\n  - So, the original expression is:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{(x^3 - 8)^2}{x^3 - 8}\n    \\]\n    \n**Simplification**:\n\n- **Cancel the Common Factor**: \n  - The expression simplifies to:\n    \\[\n    x^3 - 8\n    \\]\n    \n**Check**:\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?**: \n  - If \\(x^3 - 8\\) is the simplified expression, then evaluating it at \\(x = 6\\) should be straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Direct Evaluation Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process**:\n\n- **Simplified Expression**: \n  - After cancellation, the expression is \\(x^3 - 8\\).\n  \n- **Substitute \\(x = 6\\)**:\n  \\[\n  6^3 - 8\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculation**:\n  \\[\n  6^3 = 216\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  216 - 8 = 208\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection**:\n\n- **Quick Check**: \n  - Does 208 seem reasonable? \n  - Yes, subtracting 8 from 216 (which is \\(6^3\\)) logically gives 208.\n  \n- **Alternative Check**: \n  - Re-evaluate each step:\n    - \\(6^3 = 216\\)\n    - \\(216 - 8 = 208\\)\n  - Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Success with Factorization**: \n  - Initially, I struggled to factor the numerator directly. \n  - By introducing a substitution (\\(y = x^3\\)), the factoring became clear, leading to a straightforward simplification.\n\n- **Importance of Reflection**: \n  - Recognizing that my first attempt at factoring was incorrect helped pivot to a successful strategy.\n  - Checking each step ensured the correctness of the final answer.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies**: \n  - Initially considered direct substitution, but factoring simplified the expression significantly, making the evaluation straightforward.\n\n- **Final Answer**: \n  \\[\n  \\boxed{208}\n  \\]\n\n---\n\nThroughout this problem, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and being willing to adjust the approach were key. By exploring factorization and verifying each part, I arrived at the correct and simplified solution.",
