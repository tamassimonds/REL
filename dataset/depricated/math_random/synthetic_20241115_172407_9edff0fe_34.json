    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see what we can come up with. I'll approach it just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, exploring, reflecting, and checking my work along the way.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\nA chess team has 26 members in total, but only 16 attended the last meeting. Half of the girls attended, and all the boys did. The goal is to determine how many girls are on the chess team.\n\nHmm, okay. This reminds me of problems involving proportions and total counts. I feel like I need to set up some relationships between the different groups: boys, girls, and those who attended.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- I could use variables to represent the number of boys and girls.\n- Maybe set up equations based on the information given about attendance.\n- Alternatively, think about the proportions attending and the total to find missing values.\n\nBut wait, before jumping in, let me think about whether there's an easier way to visualize the problem. Perhaps a diagram could help, but since it's a text-based problem, I'm not sure that's practical. Maybe listing out knowns and unknowns would be better.\n\n### **Listing Known and Unknown Values:**\n\n**Known:**\n\n- Total members: 26\n- Members who attended: 16\n- Half of the girls attended\n- All boys attended\n\n**Unknown:**\n\n- Total number of girls on the team\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the total number of girls, I need to connect the attendance information with the total member count. It seems like setting up a system of equations might work, but let's see if there's a more straightforward approach first.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Use Proportions and Equations**\n\n- Let\u2019s assign variables:\n  - Let \\( G \\) be the total number of girls.\n  - Therefore, the number of boys \\( B = 26 - G \\).\n\n- According to the problem:\n  - Half of the girls attended: \\( \\frac{G}{2} \\)\n  - All boys attended: \\( B = 26 - G \\)\n\n- Total members who attended: \\( \\frac{G}{2} + B = 16 \\)\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{G}{2} + (26 - G) = 16\n\\]\n\n**Thought Check:**\n\nOkay, this equation setup makes sense because it combines both attending groups. Let's see if solving it leads us to a logical answer.\n\n**Strategy 2: Think about Ratios and Total Attendance**\n\n- Since half the girls attended, perhaps focusing on the ratio of girls to total members could simplify things.\n- However, without more specific ratios provided, this might complicate things further.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nStrategy 1 seems more direct since we have clear attendance numbers. Strategy 2 might introduce unnecessary complexity unless we can find a relationship between total members and those attending.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with Strategy 1: setting up the equation based on total attendance.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Solving the Equation**\n\n**Starting with the equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{G}{2} + (26 - G) = 16\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{G}{2} + 26 - G = 16\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{G}{2} - G + 26 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Combine Like Terms:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{G}{2} - \\frac{2G}{2} + 26 = 16\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{G}{2} + 26 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Subtract 26 from Both Sides:**\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{G}{2} = 16 - 26\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{G}{2} = -10\n\\]\n\n**Multiply Both Sides by -2 to Solve for \\( G \\):**\n\n\\[\nG = 20\n\\]\n\n**Thought Check:**\n\nWait a moment. Does it make sense for there to be 20 girls on the team? Let me reflect on this.\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\nIf \\( G = 20 \\), then:\n\n- Number of boys \\( B = 26 - 20 = 6 \\)\n- Half of the girls attended: \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\)\n- All boys attended: 6\n\nTotal attendance would be \\( 10 + 6 = 16 \\), which matches the problem statement.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe numbers add up correctly, so the solution seems valid. However, let me double-check if everything aligns with the initial conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n- Total members: 26\n- Total attended: 16\n- Girls who attended: Half of 20 = 10\n- Boys who attended: All 6\n\nSum of attendees: \\( 10 + 6 = 16 \\), which matches.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\n\n- The calculation for \\( G \\) was straightforward.\n- The attendance conditions are met perfectly with the derived number of girls.\n- There are no contradictions in the numbers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe solution is correct. There are **20 girls** on the chess team.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nThroughout the process, I started by brainstorming different strategies, settling on using an equation to relate total membership and attendance. Initially, I considered alternative methods like ratios but realized they might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\nAfter setting up the equation, I carefully walked through each step, checking if the numbers made sense. A quick verification confirmed the correctness of the solution.\n\nReflecting on the approach, utilizing a straightforward algebraic equation was effective here. In similar problems, ensuring all conditions are accounted for in the equation setup is crucial for arriving at the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThere are **20 girls** on the chess team.",

  "ground_truth": "Let there be $B$ boys and $G$ girls. Since every member is either a boy or a girl, $B+G=26$. Also, we have $\\frac{1}{2}G+B=16$. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}G=26-16=10\\implies G=20$.\n\nThus there are $\\boxed{20}$ girls on the chess team."
