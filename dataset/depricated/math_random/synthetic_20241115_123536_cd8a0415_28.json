    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll approach it just like I would if I were solving it on paper, thinking out loud, brainstorming different strategies, and reflecting along the way to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so the question is about the cost of a taxi ride. I see there's a fixed charge of $1.50 and then an additional charge of $0.25 per mile traveled. The journey is 5 miles long.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Fixed Charge:** $1.50 regardless of distance.\n- **Variable Charge:** $0.25 for each mile.\n- **Total Distance:** 5 miles.\n\nI need to find the **total cost** of the ride by combining these two components.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Add the Fixed and Variable Charges Separately:**\n   - Calculate the total variable charge for 5 miles.\n   - Add the fixed charge to this total.\n\n2. **Think About Multiplying the Per Mile Rate by Total Miles:**\n   - Maybe multiply the $0.25 by 5 and then add the fixed charge.\n\n3. **Check If There's a Simplified Formula:**\n   - Is there a simpler way to combine fixed and variable costs?\n\n**Which Strategy to Start With?**\n\nThe first strategy seems straightforward: calculate the variable cost for 5 miles and add the fixed charge. Let's go with that to see if it works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Variable Cost**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Per Mile Charge:** $0.25\n- **Total Miles:** 5\n\n*Total Variable Cost = Per Mile Charge \u00d7 Total Miles*\n\n\\[ \n0.25 \\times 5 = 1.25 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so the variable cost for 5 miles is $1.25. That makes sense because it's just $0.25 multiplied by the number of miles.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes $1.25 seem reasonable for 5 miles at $0.25 each? Yeah, that checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Adding the Fixed Charge**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Fixed Charge:** $1.50\n- **Variable Charge Calculated:** $1.25\n\n*Total Cost = Fixed Charge + Variable Charge*\n\n\\[\n1.50 + 1.25 = 2.75\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, adding the fixed charge to the variable charge gives us $2.75. That seems logical because we're just summing up both costs.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes $2.75 align with what I expect for a 5-mile taxi ride with a $1.50 base fare? Yeah, it seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my steps to ensure everything is correct.\n\n- **Fixed Charge:** \u2714\ufe0f $1.50 is clear.\n- **Variable Charge Calculation:** \u2714\ufe0f $0.25 \u00d7 5 miles = $1.25 checks out.\n- **Total Cost Addition:** \u2714\ufe0f $1.50 + $1.25 = $2.75 is correct.\n\n**Does Anything Feel Off?**\n\nNot really. The numbers make sense, and the approach aligns with how taxi fares typically work.\n\n**Alternate Strategy Check:**\n\nCould there be a simpler way? Let me think... Maybe I could have combined the fixed and variable rates into a single formula, but honestly, this method is clear and effective.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Exploring an Alternative Approach**\n\n**Brainstorming Another Strategy:**\n\nWhat if I try to calculate the total cost per mile, including the fixed charge? Would that simplify things?\n\n**Thinking It Through:**\n\n- **Fixed Charge Per Mile:** $1.50 for the entire ride, so $1.50 divided by 5 miles = $0.30 per mile.\n- **Total Per Mile Charge Including Fixed:** $0.25 (variable) + $0.30 (fixed per mile) = $0.55 per mile.\n- **Total Cost Using This Approach:** $0.55 per mile \u00d7 5 miles = $2.75.\n\n**Checking This Approach:**\n\nHmm, this also gives me $2.75, which is the same as the first method. But it feels a bit more complex because I'm dividing the fixed charge by the number of miles.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEven though both methods arrive at the same total, the **first approach** is more straightforward. The second method adds unnecessary complexity by breaking down the fixed charge per mile.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Verification**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Total Fixed Charge:** $1.50\n- **Total Variable Charge for 5 Miles:** $1.25\n- **Total Cost:** $2.75\n\nDoes everything add up correctly?\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYes, the calculations are correct, and the total cost makes sense. There's no inconsistency or mistake in the process.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying each step:\n\n- **Total Fixed Charge:** $1.50\n- **Total Variable Charge for 5 Miles:** $1.25\n- **Total Cost of the Ride:** **$2.75**\n\nSo, the cost of the 5-mile taxi ride is **$2.75**.",
