    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, thinking through each part just as I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect frequently, and check my work along the way to ensure everything makes sense. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\nGiven:\n\\[ 3x + y = 10 \\]\n\\[ x + 3y = 14 \\]\n\nFind:\n\\[ 10x^2 + 12xy + 10y^2 \\]\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This looks like a system of linear equations followed by a quadratic expression involving \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n- Personally, solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) first seems like a natural starting point. But then I need to handle the quadratic expression, which could get messy.\n- Alternatively, maybe there's a clever way to relate the expressions without finding \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) explicitly.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n1. **Solve the System of Equations:** Find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directly, then substitute into the quadratic expression.\n2. **Use Substitution or Elimination:** Attempt to eliminate one variable to simplify the system.\n3. **Consider Quadratic Identities:** Think if the quadratic expression can be rewritten using identities related to the given equations.\n4. **Matrix Method:** If I were more comfortable with matrices, I might consider solving the system that way, but it seems overkill here.\n\n**Wait a Moment:** Solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directly might be straightforward, but perhaps there's a more insightful approach that avoids dealing with two equations separately.\n\n**Ah-Ha Moment:** Maybe the quadratic expression can be linked back to the original equations, allowing me to simplify the problem without solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) individually.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Approaches**\n\n**Approach 1:** **Solve the System Using Elimination or Substitution**\n- **Elimination Method:** Attempt to eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting the equations.\n- **Substitution Method:** Solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other.\n\n**Approach 2:** **Express the Quadratic in Terms of Linear Combinations of the Given Equations**\n- Think about whether \\(10x^2 + 12xy + 10y^2\\) can be expressed using \\(3x + y = 10\\) and \\(x + 3y = 14\\).\n\n**Approach 3:** **Matrix Representation**\n- Set up the system as a matrix equation, but I'm feeling this might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\n**Reflecting:** Given the simplicity of the linear equations, perhaps Approach 1 is the most straightforward. However, Approach 2 seems intriguing\u2014maybe there's a way to leverage the linear equations to simplify the quadratic expression.\n\n**Let\u2019s Try Approach 2:** **Express the Quadratic in Terms of the Given Equations**\n\nI\u2019ll explore whether \\(10x^2 + 12xy + 10y^2\\) can be rewritten using \\(3x + y = 10\\) and \\(x + 3y = 14\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Quadratic Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The expression \\(10x^2 + 12xy + 10y^2\\) resembles a quadratic in two variables.\n- Perhaps it can be linked to the squares of the given equations or their products.\n\n**Exploring This Idea:**\n- Could I express \\(x^2\\), \\(xy\\), and \\(y^2\\) in terms of \\(3x + y\\) and \\(x + 3y\\)?\n\n**Realization:**  \nHmm, directly substituting might not be straightforward. Maybe I should think about the relationship between these expressions.\n\n**Another Idea:**  \nWhat if I multiply the given equations and see if that helps?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Multiply the Given Equations**\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Multiply \\(3x + y = 10\\) by \\(x + 3y = 14\\):\n\n\\[\n(3x + y)(x + 3y) = 10 \\times 14\n\\]\n\n*Wait, that can't be right because multiplying both sides directly like this doesn't help organize \\(x^2\\), \\(xy\\), or \\(y^2\\).*  \n**Reflection:** Multiplying is not leading us closer. Let's abandon this path.\n\n**Dead End:**  \nMultiplying the equations doesn't provide a clear path to simplifying the quadratic expression.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNeed to rethink and perhaps go back to the idea of solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**\n\nGiven the simplicity of the system, let's proceed with **Approach 1: Solve the System Using Elimination or Substitution**.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I\u2019ll use the elimination method to solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n**Elimination Method:**\n- Multiply the first equation by 3 to align the coefficients of \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n9x + 3y = 30 \\quad \\text{(Multiply both sides by 3)}\n\\]\n\n- Now, subtract the second equation from this new equation:\n\n\\[\n(9x + 3y) - (x + 3y) = 30 - 14\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n8x = 16\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\):**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{16}{8} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThat seems reasonable; \\(x = 2\\) is a simple solution.\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**  \nNo, \\(x = 2\\) makes sense here. Let's continue to find \\(y\\).\n\n**Now, Substitute \\(x = 2\\) into One of the Original Equations:**\n\nUsing \\(3x + y = 10\\):\n\n\\[\n3(2) + y = 10\n\\]\n\\[\n6 + y = 10\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 10 - 6 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Result:**  \n\\(x = 2\\), \\(y = 4\\)\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this satisfy both original equations?\n- For \\(3x + y = 10\\): \\(3(2) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- For \\(x + 3y = 14\\): \\(2 + 3(4) = 2 + 12 = 14\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth equations are satisfied, so \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 4\\) are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Substitute \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into the Quadratic Expression**\n\nNow, let's substitute \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 4\\) into:\n\n\\[\n10x^2 + 12xy + 10y^2\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n10(2^2) + 12(2)(4) + 10(4^2)\n\\]\n\n**Breaking It Down:**\n\n1. \\(10(2^2) = 10 \\times 4 = 40\\)\n2. \\(12(2)(4) = 12 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 96\\)\n3. \\(10(4^2) = 10 \\times 16 = 160\\)\n\n**Adding Them Up:**\n\n\\[\n40 + 96 + 160 = 296\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, that number seems too big. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\n**Double-Checking:**\n\n1. \\(10(2^2) = 40\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n2. \\(12(2)(4) = 96\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n3. \\(10(4^2) = 160\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n*Reflection:*  \nAll individual calculations are correct. The final sum is indeed \\(296\\).\n\n**Ah-Ha Moment:**  \nThe value \\(296\\) makes sense given the multiplications and additions. There doesn't seem to be any error.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- By initially attempting to connect the quadratic expression to the given linear equations, I realized that direct multiplication wasn't helpful.\n- Switching to solving the system of equations using the elimination method provided the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) efficiently.\n- Substituting these values into the quadratic expression yielded the correct result.\n- Throughout the process, checking each step ensured the calculations were accurate and aligned with the problem's requirements.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n10x^2 + 12xy + 10y^2 = \\boxed{296}\n\\]\n\n**Check Reflection:**  \n- All steps logically follow each other.\n- Both original equations were satisfied by the found \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n- The calculations within the quadratic expression were verified multiple times.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nApproaching the problem by first solving the system of equations and then substituting the solutions into the quadratic expression was the most straightforward and error-free method. Exploring different strategies helped ensure that the chosen path was the most efficient.",
