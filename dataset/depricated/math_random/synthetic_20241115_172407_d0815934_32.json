    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it as if I'm brainstorming and exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way. Let's see where this takes us.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see the equation:\n\n\\[ f(2^x) + x f(2^{-x}) = 1 \\]\n\nfor all real numbers \\( x \\). The goal is to find \\( f(2) \\).\n\nImmediately, I notice that the function \\( f \\) is evaluated at both \\( 2^x \\) and \\( 2^{-x} \\). This symmetry hints that maybe substituting specific values for \\( x \\) could simplify things. Also, the presence of \\( x \\) multiplying \\( f(2^{-x}) \\) makes me think about how linearity might play a role, but I'm not completely sure yet.\n\nAnother thought is whether this relates to logarithmic or exponential functions, given the bases and exponents involved. But before jumping to conclusions, I think it's essential to explore different strategies.\n\n---\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Substitute Specific Values for \\( x \\):**  \n   Try plugging in particular values like \\( x = 1 \\), \\( x = -1 \\), \\( x = 0 \\), etc., to see if any patterns emerge.\n\n2. **Explore Symmetry:**  \n   Since the equation involves \\( 2^x \\) and \\( 2^{-x} \\), perhaps there's a symmetric property that can be leveraged.\n\n3. **Attempt Functional Equations Techniques:**  \n   Look for solutions that satisfy functional equations, possibly assuming forms for \\( f(x) \\).\n\n4. **Consider Linear Functions:**  \n   Maybe \\( f(x) \\) is a linear function, so exploring \\( f(x) = ax + b \\) could be worthwhile.\n\n5. **Check for Logarithmic or Exponential Functions:**  \n   Given the bases involved, perhaps \\( f(x) \\) is related to logarithmic or exponential functions.\n\nI think starting with **substituting specific values** is a practical first step. If that doesn't work, I'll consider the other strategies.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Substitute \\( x = 1 \\)**\n\nLet's see what happens when \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ f(2^1) + 1 \\cdot f(2^{-1}) = 1 \\]  \n\\[ f(2) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 \\]  \n**Reflection:** This gives us a relationship between \\( f(2) \\) and \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\). It might be helpful later.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\( x = -1 \\)**\n\nNow, let's try \\( x = -1 \\):\n\n\\[ f(2^{-1}) + (-1) \\cdot f(2^1) = 1 \\]  \n\\[ f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - f(2) = 1 \\]  \n**Reflection:** This is another equation involving \\( f(2) \\) and \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\). Now we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( f(2) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 \\)  \n2. \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - f(2) = 1 \\)\n\nAt this point, I can see that solving this system might lead us to \\( f(2) \\). But before proceeding, let's check if substituting \\( x = 0 \\) yields anything useful.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Substitute \\( x = 0 \\)**\n\nLet's try \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ f(2^0) + 0 \\cdot f(2^{-0}) = 1 \\]  \n\\[ f(1) + 0 = 1 \\]  \n\\[ f(1) = 1 \\]  \n**Reflection:** This tells us that \\( f(1) = 1 \\). Knowing \\( f(1) \\) could be useful later, but right now, I think focusing on the system of equations involving \\( f(2) \\) and \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\) is more immediate.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Solve the System of Equations**\n\nNow, let's solve the following system:\n\n1. \\( f(2) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 \\)  \n2. \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - f(2) = 1 \\)\n\nI can add these two equations to eliminate one of the variables:\n\n\\[ (f(2) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)) + (f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - f(2)) = 1 + 1 \\]  \n\\[ f(2) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - f(2) = 2 \\]  \n\\[ 2f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2 \\]  \n\\[ f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 \\]  \n**Check:** Wait, does this make sense? According to our initial substitution (#1), if \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 \\), then:\n\n\\[ f(2) + 1 = 1 \\]  \n\\[ f(2) = 0 \\]  \nBut then, according to our second equation (#2), \n\n\\[ 1 - f(2) = 1 \\]  \n\\[ 1 - 0 = 1 \\]  \nWhich is consistent. So, \\( f(2) = 0 \\) seems correct.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Solution**\n\nBefore concluding, let's double-check if \\( f(2) = 0 \\) satisfies the original equation.\n\nGiven \\( f(2) = 0 \\) and \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 \\), let's see if they satisfy:\n\n\\[ f(2^x) + x f(2^{-x}) = 1 \\]\n\n- For \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ f(2) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0 + 1 = 1 \\]  \n**Check:** This matches the original equation.\n\n- For \\( x = -1 \\):\n\n\\[ f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - f(2) = 1 - 0 = 1 \\]  \n**Check:** This also matches the original equation.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, \\( f(2) = 0 \\) is indeed correct.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nBy substituting specific values into the original equation, I was able to set up a system of equations relating \\( f(2) \\) and \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\). Solving this system revealed that \\( f(2) = 0 \\). \n\nReflecting on the process, starting with substitutions was a straightforward approach that led directly to the solution. Exploring other strategies, like assuming a specific form for \\( f(x) \\), might have worked too, but wasn't necessary here since the system was easy to solve.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe value of \\( f(2) \\) is \n\n\\[\\boxed{0}\\]",
