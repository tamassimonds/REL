    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I\u2019d approach it if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure to check my work along the way. Let's begin by fully understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, here's the problem:\n\nGiven the piecewise function\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\nx + 2 & \\text{if } x > 3 \\\\\n2x + a & \\text{if } x \\leq 3\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nI need to find the value of \\( a \\) that makes this function continuous. Continuity at a point typically means that the limits from both sides of that point are equal to the function's value at that point. \n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This looks like a typical piecewise function continuity problem.\n- I've encountered similar problems before, where ensuring the two pieces connect smoothly is crucial.\n- My first thought is to check the continuity at the boundary point, which is \\( x = 3 \\) here. That's usually where issues arise.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Set the Two Pieces Equal at \\( x = 3 \\):** This is the standard approach. If the function is continuous, the value from the right side must equal the value from the left side at \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n2. **Check One-Sided Limits:** Ensure that the limit as \\( x \\) approaches 3 from the left equals the limit as \\( x \\) approaches 3 from the right.\n\n3. **Consider Differentiability:** Although not required, checking if the function is differentiable at \\( x = 3 \\) might provide additional insights.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- I think starting with setting the two pieces equal at \\( x = 3 \\) makes the most sense because continuity directly relates to the values matching at that point.\n- If that doesn't work out, maybe I can explore one-sided limits.\n\nLet\u2019s move forward with the first strategy: **Set the Two Pieces Equal at \\( x = 3 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Set the Two Pieces Equal at \\( x = 3 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For \\( f(x) \\) to be continuous at \\( x = 3 \\), the value of the function from the left (\\( 2x + a \\)) must equal the value from the right (\\( x + 2 \\)).\n- So, I\u2019ll set \\( 2(3) + a = 3 + 2 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n2(3) + a = 3 + 2 \\\\\n6 + a = 5 \\\\\na = 5 - 6 \\\\\na = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, that gives me \\( a = -1 \\). Does this make sense?\n- Let me check quickly: If \\( a = -1 \\), then the left side at \\( x = 3 \\) would be \\( 6 - 1 = 5 \\), and the right side is also \\( 5 \\). So they match.\n- That seems correct, but let\u2019s verify by checking one-sided limits to be sure.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Left limit as \\( x \\) approaches 3: \\( f(3) = 2(3) + (-1) = 5 \\).\n- Right limit as \\( x \\) approaches 3: \\( f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5 \\).\n\nBoth sides match, so \\( a = -1 \\) makes the function continuous at \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n**But wait**, it\u2019s always good to double-check. Let me consider whether there's another approach I might have missed.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Check One-Sided Limits**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Instead of merely setting the two pieces equal, I can compute the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit as \\( x \\) approaches 3.\n- This will confirm that both limits are equal, ensuring continuity.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Left-Hand Limit (\\( \\lim_{x \\to 3^-} f(x) \\)):**\n\n  Since \\( x \\leq 3 \\), use \\( f(x) = 2x + a \\):\n\n  \\[\n  \\lim_{x \\to 3^-} f(x) = 2(3) + a = 6 + a\n  \\]\n\n- **Right-Hand Limit (\\( \\lim_{x \\to 3^+} f(x) \\)):**\n\n  Since \\( x > 3 \\), use \\( f(x) = x + 2 \\):\n\n  \\[\n  \\lim_{x \\to 3^+} f(x) = 3 + 2 = 5\n  \\]\n\n**Set the Limits Equal:**\n\nFor continuity,\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 3^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 3^+} f(x) \\\\\n6 + a = 5\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[\na = 5 - 6 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Both methods lead to the same value \\( a = -1 \\).\n- This consistency reassures me that the solution is correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- With \\( a = -1 \\), the function is continuous because the left and right limits at \\( x = 3 \\) are equal.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verify Continuity**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To be absolutely certain, I\u2019ll verify that with \\( a = -1 \\), the function is indeed continuous at \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Left-Hand Limit:** \\( \\lim_{x \\to 3^-} f(x) = 2(3) + (-1) = 5 \\)\n- **Right-Hand Limit:** \\( \\lim_{x \\to 3^+} f(x) = 3 + 2 = 5 \\)\n- **Function Value at \\( x = 3 \\):** \\( f(3) = 2(3) + (-1) = 5 \\)\n\nAll three are equal, so **the function is continuous at \\( x = 3 \\)** when \\( a = -1 \\).\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- By approaching the problem through setting the two pieces equal and verifying with one-sided limits, I've confirmed that \\( a = -1 \\) is the correct value for continuity.\n- It\u2019s always helpful to check multiple strategies to ensure the solution is robust.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nTo make the piecewise function \n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\nx + 2 & \\text{if } x > 3 \\\\\n2x + a & \\text{if } x \\leq 3\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\ncontinuous at \\( x = 3 \\), the value of \\( a \\) must be **-1**.",
