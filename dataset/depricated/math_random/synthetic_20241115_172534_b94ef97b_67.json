    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by reflecting on the question, brainstorming different strategies, and thinking through each step as naturally as possible\u2014just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:  \n*The second and fifth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 17 and 19, respectively. What is the eighth term?*\n\nmy initial reaction is:\n\n- **Familiarity with Arithmetic Sequences:**  \n  This reminds me of arithmetic sequences I\u2019ve dealt with before. I recall that in such sequences, each term is generated by adding a fixed number (the common difference) to the previous term.\n\n- **Need to Find the Common Difference:**  \n  I think I probably need to determine the common difference first. Maybe set up equations involving the second and fifth terms to solve for it.\n\n- **Possibility of Setting Up a System of Equations:**  \n  It seems like I might end up with two equations and two unknowns: the common difference and the first term.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:**  \n  Alternatively, I could consider using properties of arithmetic sequences, like the relationship between terms that are a certain number of positions apart.\n\nBut wait, let me explore a bit more before committing to a strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Using the Definition of an Arithmetic Sequence:**\n   - Each term is the previous term plus a constant (the common difference).\n   - Set up equations based on the second and fifth terms.\n\n2. **Exploring the Relation Between Terms:**\n   - Maybe there's a pattern or formula relating non-adjacent terms that could simplify things.\n\n3. **Using a General Formula for the n-th Term:**\n   - Recall that the n-th term can be expressed as the first term plus (n-1) times the common difference.\n\n4. **Visualizing the Sequence:**\n   - Writing out the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges could help.\n\nHmm\u2026 Depending on which strategy I pick, I might see different paths. Let\u2019s start with the first one, as it seems the most straightforward: setting up equations based on the given terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up Equations**\n\nLet\u2019s denote  \n- The first term as \\( a_1 \\)  \n- The common difference as \\( d \\)  \n- The n-th term as \\( a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \\)\n\nGiven:  \n- \\( a_2 = 17 \\)  \n- \\( a_5 = 19 \\)  \n\nUsing the formula for the n-th term:\n\n\\[\na_2 = a_1 + (2 - 1)d = a_1 + d = 17  \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\\[\na_5 = a_1 + (5 - 1)d = a_1 + 4d = 19  \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nOkay, now I have two equations:  \n- **Equation 1:** \\( a_1 + d = 17 \\)  \n- **Equation 2:** \\( a_1 + 4d = 19 \\)\n\nI can see that both equations involve \\( a_1 \\) and \\( d \\). It looks like a classic system of linear equations problem. I should be able to solve for \\( a_1 \\) and \\( d \\) using substitution or elimination.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the System of Equations**\n\nLet\u2019s use elimination to solve for \\( d \\).\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n\\[\n(a_1 + 4d) - (a_1 + d) = 19 - 17\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n3d = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNice! This gives me the value of \\( d \\). Let me double-check the subtraction to make sure I didn\u2019t make a mistake.\n\n\\[\na_1 + 4d - (a_1 + d) = 4d - d = 3d\n\\]\n\nLooks correct.\n\n---\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nNow that I have \\( d = \\frac{2}{3} \\), I can plug this back into one of the original equations to find \\( a_1 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the First Term \\( a_1 \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\( d = \\frac{2}{3} \\) into Equation 1:\n\n\\[\na_1 + \\frac{2}{3} = 17\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\na_1 = 17 - \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\( 17 - \\frac{2}{3} \\):**  \nFirst, convert 17 to a fraction:\n\n\\[\n17 = \\frac{51}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\na_1 = \\frac{51}{3} - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{49}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet me check the subtraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{51}{3} - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{51 - 2}{3} = \\frac{49}{3}\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\n---\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nI now have \\( a_1 = \\frac{49}{3} \\) and \\( d = \\frac{2}{3} \\). I could double-check these values by plugging them back into the original equations, but since I followed the steps carefully, I\u2019ll proceed to find the eighth term.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Eighth Term \\( a_8 \\)**\n\nNow, using the formula for the n-th term:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s compute \\( a_8 \\):\n\n\\[\na_8 = \\frac{49}{3} + (8 - 1) \\times \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\na_8 = \\frac{49}{3} + 7 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{49}{3} + \\frac{14}{3}\n\\]\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n\\[\na_8 = \\frac{49 + 14}{3} = \\frac{63}{3} = 21\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet me double-check the multiplication and addition:\n\n\\[\n7 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{49}{3} + \\frac{14}{3} = \\frac{63}{3} = 21\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let me quickly verify:\n\n- **Does \\( a_1 = \\frac{49}{3} \\) and \\( d = \\frac{2}{3} \\) satisfy the original equations?**\n\nFor \\( a_2 = 17 \\):\n\n\\[\na_2 = a_1 + d = \\frac{49}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{51}{3} = 17\n\\]\n\nFor \\( a_5 = 19 \\):\n\n\\[\na_5 = a_1 + 4d = \\frac{49}{3} + 4 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{49}{3} + \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{57}{3} = 19\n\\]\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, setting up and solving a system of equations, and verifying the calculations, I\u2019ve determined that the eighth term of the arithmetic sequence is:\n\n**\\( a_8 = 21 \\)**\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nThroughout the process, I brainstormed various approaches, checked my work at each step, and made adjustments as needed. By systematically solving for the common difference and the first term, and then applying the formula for the n-th term, I arrived at the correct solution. Adjusting strategies and verifying each step ensured accuracy in the final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$.  Then the second term is $a + d = 17$, fifth term is $a + 4d = 19$, and the eighth term is $a + 7d$.  Note that $(a + 4d) - (a + d) = 3d$, and $(a + 7d) - (a + 4d) = 3d$, so the terms $a + d = 17$, $a + 4d = 19$, and $a + 7d$ also form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nIf 17 and 19 are consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence, then the common difference is $19 - 17 = 2$, so the next term must be $19 + 2 = \\boxed{21}$."
