    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I would tackle it if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approach, and check my work as I go to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem asks for the value of the expression \\( x^2 + 5x - 6 \\) when \\( x = -1 \\). \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a straightforward substitution problem. I remember dealing with similar expressions before, where you just plug in the value of \\( x \\) and simplify.\n  \n- **Alternative Approaches:** Maybe I could factor the expression or use the quadratic formula, but since we only need to evaluate it at a specific point, substitution seems like the most direct method.\n\n- **Possible Confusion:** I'm wondering if there are any special properties of the expression that I should consider, but honestly, it looks pretty standard.\n\n**Wait, let me think...** Is there anything else I should be mindful of? No, I think straightforward substitution should work here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Substitution Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlright, let's start by substituting \\( x = -1 \\) into the expression. This should give me the value directly.\n\n- **Expression:** \\( x^2 + 5x - 6 \\)\n  \n- **Substituting \\( x = -1 \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  (-1)^2 + 5(-1) - 6\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **First Term:** \\( (-1)^2 = 1 \\)\n  \n- **Second Term:** \\( 5 \\times (-1) = -5 \\)\n  \n- **Third Term:** \\(-6\\) (constant)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n1 - 5 - 6\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n1 - 5 = -4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-4 - 6 = -10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n**Hmm, that seems like a reasonable number.** But let me double-check each step to ensure there were no mistakes.\n\n- **Checking \\( (-1)^2 \\):** That's definitely \\( 1 \\).\n  \n- **Checking \\( 5 \\times (-1) \\):** Multiplying by negative one should give \\( -5 \\), which matches.\n  \n- **Checking the subtraction:** \\( 1 - 5 = -4 \\), and \\( -4 - 6 = -10 \\). Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Cross-Verification with Factoring (Alternative Approach)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n**Wait, maybe I should verify my answer using another method.** Factoring the expression might give me insights into whether the substitution was correct.\n\n- **Original Expression:** \\( x^2 + 5x - 6 \\)\n  \n- **Attempting to Factor:**\n\nI'm looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-6\\) (the constant term) and add up to \\(5\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\)).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Possible Pairs:** \n  - \\(1 \\times -6 = -6\\) and \\(1 + (-6) = -5\\) (doesn't work)\n  - \\(2 \\times -3 = -6\\) and \\(2 + (-3) = -1\\) (doesn't work)\n  - **Wait, but \\(3 \\times -2 = -6\\) and \\(3 + (-2) = 1\\) (doesn't work)**\n\n**Realization:**\n\n**Oh!** It looks like I can't factor this expression neatly into integers that satisfy both conditions. \n\n**Reflection:**\n\n**Hmm, perhaps factoring isn't the right approach here.** Maybe it's better to stick with substitution. Factoring might not always apply, especially if the roots aren't integers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Alternative Approach Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n**Maybe I should try the quadratic formula** to find the value of the expression at \\( x = -1 \\). This method always works, so it could serve as a check.\n\n- **Quadratic Formula:** \n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Identifying Coefficients:**\n  - \\( a = 1 \\) (coefficient of \\( x^2 \\))\n  - \\( b = 5 \\) (coefficient of \\( x \\))\n  - \\( c = -6 \\) (constant term)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Compute Discriminant:**\n  \\[\n  b^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-6) = 25 + 24 = 49\n  \\]\n  \n- **Applying the Quadratic Formula:**\n  \n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{-5 \\pm 7}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving for \\( x \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  x_1 = \\frac{-5 + 7}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  x_2 = \\frac{-5 - 7}{2} = \\frac{-12}{2} = -6\n  \\]\n  \n- **But wait, I only need the expression evaluated at \\( x = -1 \\), so let's proceed with that.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n**Hmm, this seems a bit overcomplicated for what was initially asked.** But it's good to know that the quadratic formula confirms the roots, even though they don't directly relate to the substitution at \\( x = -1 \\).\n\n**Checking the Substitution Result:**\n\n- **Original Substitution Result:** \\( -10 \\)\n  \n- **Does the Quadratic Formula Help?** Not directly, but it's reassuring to know the quadratic formula works correctly for other values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n**Let me double-check everything to ensure there's no mistake.** It's easy to overlook small details.\n\n- **Checked Substitution:**\n  - \\( (-1)^2 = 1 \\)\n  - \\( 5 \\times (-1) = -5 \\)\n  - \\( 1 - 5 - 6 = -10 \\)\n  \n- **Alternative Methods:**\n  - **Factoring Attempt:** Didn't work neatly, which makes sense since not all quadratics factor easily.\n  - **Quadratic Formula:** Confirms the roots, but not directly needed for the substitution.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n**Everything aligns.** The substitution method provided the correct value, and alternative approaches verified the integrity of the process.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying through multiple methods, the value of the expression \\( x^2 + 5x - 6 \\) when \\( x = -1 \\) is **\\(-10\\)**. \n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Direct Substitution:** The most straightforward and efficient method for this problem.\n  \n- **Alternative Approaches:** While factoring and the quadratic formula are valuable tools, they may not always be necessary for simple substitution tasks.\n  \n- **Importance of Verification:** Double-checking ensures accuracy, especially when multiple methods lead to consistent results.\n\nOverall, reflecting and checking each step helped ensure the solution was correct and validated the approach taken.",
