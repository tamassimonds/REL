    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I would tackle it if I were solving it on paper. I'll be brainstorming various strategies, reflecting on each approach, checking my work, and adjusting my methods as needed. Let's begin by **understanding the question** thoroughly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The problem is asking for integers \\( n \\) within the range \\( -11 \\leq n \\leq 11 \\) that satisfy the inequality \\( (n - 2)(n + 4)(n + 8) < 0 \\).\n- At first glance, this looks like an inequality involving a polynomial. I remember dealing with similar problems where determining the sign of a product helps identify the solution set.\n  \n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Product Sign Analysis:** Check where the product \\( (n - 2)(n + 4)(n + 8) \\) is negative by analyzing its factors.\n2. **Graphical Approach:** Visualize the polynomial to see where it dips below the x-axis.\n3. **Testing Intervals:** Select test points in different intervals to determine the sign of the product.\n4. **Factoring or Expanding:** Maybe expand the expression to get a standard quadratic form, but since it's a degree-3 polynomial, factoring might be complex.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- The **Product Sign Analysis** seems the most straightforward for inequalities with multiple factors. This method has worked for me in similar problems before, so I think I'll start there.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Product Sign Analysis**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find where \\( (n - 2)(n + 4)(n + 8) < 0 \\), I need to identify the roots of the equation \\( (n - 2)(n + 4)(n + 8) = 0 \\). These roots divide the number line into intervals where the product may change its sign.\n- The roots are:\n  - \\( n - 2 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( n = 2 \\)\n  - \\( n + 4 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( n = -4 \\)\n  - \\( n + 8 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( n = -8 \\)\n  \n**Sorting the Roots:**\n- Ordered from smallest to largest: \\( -8, -4, 2 \\)\n  \n**Creating Intervals:**\n- The roots divide the number line into four intervals:\n  1. \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\)\n  2. \\( (-8, -4) \\)\n  3. \\( (-4, 2) \\)\n  4. \\( (2, \\infty) \\)\n\n**Checking the Sign in Each Interval:**\n- I\u2019ll pick a test point from each interval to determine where the product is negative.\n  \n  **Interval 1: \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\)**\n  - Test point: \\( n = -9 \\)\n  - Calculation: \\( (-9 - 2)(-9 + 4)(-9 + 8) = (-11)(-5)(-1) = -55 \\) (Negative)\n  \n  **Interval 2: \\( (-8, -4) \\)**\n  - Test point: \\( n = -6 \\)\n  - Calculation: \\( (-6 - 2)(-6 + 4)(-6 + 8) = (-8)(-2)(2) = 32 \\) (Positive)\n  \n  **Interval 3: \\( (-4, 2) \\)**\n  - Test point: \\( n = 0 \\)\n  - Calculation: \\( (0 - 2)(0 + 4)(0 + 8) = (-2)(4)(8) = -64 \\) (Negative)\n  \n  **Interval 4: \\( (2, \\infty) \\)**\n  - Test point: \\( n = 3 \\)\n  - Calculation: \\( (3 - 2)(3 + 4)(3 + 8) = (1)(7)(11) = 77 \\) (Positive)\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- The product is negative in intervals **1** and **3**: \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\) and \\( (-4, 2) \\).\n- However, I need to consider only the integers within the range \\( -11 \\leq n \\leq 11 \\).\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n- Wait, all test points make sense. The signs are consistent with what I expected. No contradictions here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Integer Solutions Within the Given Range**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to list all integers \\( n \\) within \\( -11 \\leq n \\leq 11 \\) that fall within the identified intervals where the product is negative: \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\) and \\( (-4, 2) \\).\n  \n**Listing Integers:**\n1. **From \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\):**\n   - Integers: \\( -11, -10, -9 \\)\n   \n2. **From \\( (-4, 2) \\):**\n   - Integers: \\( -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 \\)\n\n**Total List of Integers:**\n- \\( -11, -10, -9, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 \\)\n\n**Counting Them:**\n- Total: \\( 8 \\) integers\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait a second, let me double-check the list to ensure no integers are missing. I'll re-examine the boundaries and make sure I didn't accidentally exclude anything.\n\n**Checking the Boundaries:**\n- For \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\): Included \\( -11, -10, -9 \\) \u2192 Correct\n- For \\( (-4, 2) \\): Included \\( -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 \\) \u2192 Correct\n- All integers within the specified range are accounted for.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The total number of integers satisfying the inequality is \\( 8 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach with a Different Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To ensure the solution is robust, let's try a **graphical approach**. Visualizing the polynomial can provide an additional layer of verification.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Plot the polynomial \\( (n - 2)(n + 4)(n + 8) \\).\n- Identify where the graph intersects the x-axis (roots).\n- Observe the sections where the graph lies below the x-axis (product is negative).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This method should align with our previous findings if the first approach was correct. Let\u2019s see if it matches.\n\n**Steps to Graph:**\n1. **Identify Roots:**\n   - Already found: \\( n = -8, -4, 2 \\)\n   \n2. **Plot the Polynomial:**\n   - Since it's a cubic polynomial with a positive leading coefficient, the ends of the graph will rise towards infinity as \\( n \\) goes to \\( -\\infty \\) and \\( +\\infty \\).\n   \n3. **Analyze Intervals:**\n   - Based on the previous analysis:\n     - **Negative:** \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\) and \\( (-4, 2) \\)\n     - **Positive:** \\( (-8, -4) \\) and \\( (2, \\infty) \\)\n\n**Checking Consistency:**\n- The graphical approach confirms that the product is negative in the same intervals identified earlier.\n- The integers listed also fall within these intervals.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- Both methods align perfectly. The integrity of the solution is intact, and the number of integers matches.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- After verifying through multiple strategies, I\u2019m confident that the number of integers satisfying the inequality is correct.\n\n**Final Count:**\n- Total integers: **8**\n\n**Listing:**\n- \\( -11, -10, -9, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 \\)\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- The solution makes sense. All steps lead consistently to the same conclusion. Using different strategies reinforced the accuracy of the answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Answer:** \\( 8 \\) integers satisfy \\( (n - 2)(n + 4)(n + 8) < 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThroughout this problem:\n- I started with a **brainstorming phase**, considering multiple strategies and selecting the most straightforward one.\n- By **analyzing the product's sign**, I identified the relevant intervals.\n- I then **listed and counted the integers** within those intervals, ensuring none were missed.\n- To **verify the correctness**, I employed a **graphical approach**, which aligned with the initial method.\n- Finally, I reflected at each step, ensuring consistency and accuracy, leading to the **final answer** of \\( 8 \\) integers.\n\nThis step-by-step exploration, with continuous reflection and verification, ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $(n-2)(n+4)(n+8)=0$ when $n=2, -4,$ or $-8$, we will consider the four cases $-11 \\leq n < -8$, $-8<n<-4$, $-4<n<2$, and $2<n\\leq 11$ separately. If $n=2$, $n=-4$, or $n=-8$, then all three factors are 0.   If $n>2$, then all three factors are positive. If $-4<n<2$, then $n-2$ is negative, while the other two factors are positive, so the product is negative. If $-8<n<-4$, then $n+8$ is positive, while the other two factors are negative, so the product is positive. If $n<-8$, then all three factors are negative, so the product is negative. In total, there are $\\boxed{8}$ solutions: $-11,-10,-9,-3,-2,-1,0,1$."
