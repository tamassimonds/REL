I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work regularly, just like I would if I were solving this on paper.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question **\"How many vertical asymptotes does the equation \\( y = \\frac{x-1}{x^2 + 6x - 7} \\) have?\"**, my initial reaction is to recall what vertical asymptotes are. From past experience, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function equals zero (and the numerator isn't zero at those points). This is because the function becomes undefined at those points, leading to vertical lines on the graph.\n\nBut before diving in, I want to brainstorm a bit:\n\n- **Brainstorming:**\n  - Should I directly set the denominator to zero?\n  - Maybe factor the denominator to find the roots?\n  - Is there another method, like analyzing limits, that could help?\n\nAt this point, factoring the denominator seems like a straightforward approach. If that doesn't work, I can explore other methods like checking limits or using the quadratic formula. Let's start with factoring.\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Factor the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nOkay, let's try to factor the denominator \\( x^2 + 6x - 7 \\). If I can find the roots, those will be the x-values where the vertical asymptotes occur.\n\n**Calculation:**\nI need to find two numbers that multiply to \\(-7\\) (the constant term) and add up to \\(6\\) (the coefficient of the linear term).\n\n- **Multiplying to -7:**\n  - Possible pairs: \\(1 \\times -7\\), \\(-1 \\times 7\\), \\(7 \\times -1\\), \\(-7 \\times 1\\)\n  \n- **Adding to 6:**\n  - Check each pair:\n    - \\(1 + (-7) = -6\\)\n    - \\(-1 + 7 = 6\\) \u2705\n  \nSo, the correct pair is \\(-1\\) and \\(7\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, this works! The numbers \\(-1\\) and \\(7\\) add up to \\(6\\) and multiply to \\(-7\\). That means I can factor the quadratic expression.\n\n**Continuing:**\nLet's write the factored form:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 6x - 7 = (x - 1)(x + 7)\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nTo verify, I'll multiply the factors back:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)(x + 7) = x^2 + 7x - 1x - 7 = x^2 + 6x - 7\n\\]\n\nThat matches the original denominator, so the factoring is correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Vertical Asymptotes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have factored the denominator, \\( (x - 1)(x + 7) \\), I can set each factor equal to zero to find the vertical asymptotes.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Set \\( x - 1 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( x = 1 \\)\n- Set \\( x + 7 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( x = -7 \\)\n\n**Check:**\nThese are the values where the denominator is zero, and since the numerator \\( x - 1 \\) is not zero at \\( x = -7 \\), both \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -7 \\) are indeed vertical asymptotes.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis makes sense. I've identified two points where the function is undefined: \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -7 \\). Therefore, there are **two** vertical asymptotes.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Check:**\nLet me quickly verify if setting the denominator to zero is the correct approach for finding vertical asymptotes.\n\n- **Understanding:** Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function is zero (and the numerator isn't zero).\n- **Application:** By factoring the denominator and finding the roots, I identified the correct asymptotes.\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The method aligns with the theoretical background, and the calculations are consistent.\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAlthough factoring worked well, I want to consider if there are other methods to confirm the results.\n\n- **Alternative Methods:**\n  - **Quadratic Formula:** Use \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the roots.\n  - **Analyzing Limits:** Check the behavior of the function as \\( x \\) approaches the asymptote values.\n\n**Considering the Quadratic Formula:**\n\n**Calculation:**\nFor the equation \\( x^2 + 6x - 7 = 0 \\):\n\n- \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 6 \\), \\( c = -7 \\)\n- Discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac = 36 + 28 = 64 \\)\n- Roots:\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm 8}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{-14}{2} = -7\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nUsing the quadratic formula gives the same roots: \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -7 \\). This confirms that the factoring method was correct.\n\n**Considering Analyzing Limits:**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAnother way to verify is by examining the limits of the function as \\( x \\) approaches the asymptote values. If the limits approach infinity or negative infinity, it indicates vertical asymptotes.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **As \\( x \\) approaches 1:**\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{1 - 1}{1^2 + 6 \\times 1 - 7} = \\frac{0}{0} \\quad \\text{(indeterminate)}\n  \\]\n  - This suggests a removable discontinuity, but since the numerator is also zero, it might not be a vertical asymptote. However, upon closer inspection, the numerator and denominator both have a common factor \\( x - 1 \\), which can be cancelled, but that doesn't affect the existence of the asymptote at \\( x = -7 \\).\n\n- **As \\( x \\) approaches -7:**\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{-7 - 1}{(-7)^2 + 6 \\times (-7) - 7} = \\frac{-8}{49 - 42 - 7} = \\frac{-8}{0} \\quad \\text{(undefined)}\n  \\]\n  - This indicates a vertical asymptote at \\( x = -7 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nAnalyzing the limits confirms that \\( x = -7 \\) is a vertical asymptote. However, since the limit at \\( x = 1 \\) was indeterminate, it suggests that \\( x = 1 \\) might be a removable discontinuity rather than a vertical asymptote. This means that after cancelling the common factor \\( x - 1 \\), \\( x = 1 \\) does not remain an asymptote.\n\n### **Step 5: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBased on both factoring and analyzing limits, it appears that there is **one** vertical asymptote at \\( x = -7 \\). The point \\( x = 1 \\) is a removable discontinuity, so it's not considered a vertical asymptote.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Vertical Asymptotes:** \\( x = -7 \\)\n- **Removing \\( x = 1 \\):** Since \\( x - 1 \\) is a common factor, the asymptote at \\( x = 1 \\) is removed after simplification.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nInitially, factoring alone suggested two asymptotes, but considering the removable discontinuity at \\( x = 1 \\) clarifies that there is only **one** vertical asymptote at \\( x = -7 \\).\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n**There is **one** vertical asymptote at \\( x = -7 \\).**\n\n### **Conclusion and Check:**\n\n- **Strategy Verification:** Factoring the denominator was an effective initial strategy, confirmed by the quadratic formula.\n- **Limit Analysis:** Examining limits provided additional confirmation and helped identify the removable discontinuity.\n- **Reflection Throughout:** Regular checks and reflections ensured the correctness of each step, leading to the accurate identification of the vertical asymptote.\n\nEverything seems to align, and the approach is consistent with mathematical principles regarding vertical asymptotes in rational functions.",

  "ground_truth": "By factoring the denominator, the equation becomes $\\frac{x-1}{(x-1)(x+7)}$. So the denominator equals $0$ when $x=1$ and $x=-7$. However, since the term $x-1$ also exists in the numerator and is of the same degree as in the denominator, $x=1$ is not a vertical asymptote. Therefore, the equation has only $\\boxed{1}$ vertical asymptote at $x=-7$."
