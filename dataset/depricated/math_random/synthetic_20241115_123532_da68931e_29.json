    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by exploring different strategies and brainstorming how to approach it. I'll walk through my thought process, reflecting and checking my work along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n\\[ (-2)^{3} + (-2)^{2} + (-2)^{1} + 2^{1} + 2^{2} + 2^{3} \\]\n\nI notice it's asking for the sum of several exponential terms involving both negative and positive bases. **This looks like a combination of powers of -2 and 2.**\n\nI remember that exponents can affect the sign depending on whether the base is negative or positive. **The negative base might complicate things a bit, especially with odd and even exponents.**\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Evaluate Each Term Individually:**\n   - Calculate each power separately and then sum them up.\n   \n2. **Group Positive and Negative Terms:**\n   - Perhaps group the terms with negative bases and positive bases to see if there's a pattern or simplification.\n\n3. **Factor Out Common Terms:**\n   - Look for common factors that can be factored out to simplify the calculation.\n\n4. **Use Properties of Exponents:**\n   - Apply rules like \\((-a)^{n} = (-1)^{n} \\times a^{n}\\) to handle negative exponents more easily.\n\n**Looking at these options, I think the first strategy\u2014evaluating each term individually\u2014might be the most straightforward. However, grouping and factoring could simplify the process. Let's start with evaluating each term to get a feel for it.**\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluating Each Term Individually**\n\nLet me calculate each exponent one by one.\n\n1. **\\((-2)^{3}\\):**\n   \\[\n   (-2) \\times (-2) \\times (-2) = (-2) \\times 4 = -8\n   \\]\n   \n2. **\\((-2)^{2}\\):**\n   \\[\n   (-2) \\times (-2) = 4\n   \\]\n   \n3. **\\((-2)^{1}\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2\n   \\]\n   \n4. **\\(2^{1}\\):**\n   \\[\n   2\n   \\]\n   \n5. **\\(2^{2}\\):**\n   \\[\n   4\n   \\]\n   \n6. **\\(2^{3}\\):**\n   \\[\n   8\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo far, I have:\n\n\\[\n(-2)^{3} = -8,\\quad (-2)^{2} = 4,\\quad (-2)^{1} = -2,\\quad 2^{1} = 2,\\quad 2^{2} = 4,\\quad 2^{3} = 8\n\\]\n\nWhen I sum these up:\n\n\\[\n-8 + 4 - 2 + 2 + 4 + 8\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet me check if this seems reasonable. The negative and positive terms should balance each other out to some extent.\n\n### **Step 2: Adding the Terms Together**\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n1. **First Add Negative Terms:**\n   \\[\n   -8 + 4 = -4\n   \\]\n   \n   Then include the next negative term:\n   \\[\n   -4 - 2 = -6\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Now Add Positive Terms:**\n   \\[\n   -6 + 2 = -4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -4 + 4 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0 + 8 = 8\n   \\]\n\n**Total Sum:**  \nThe final sum is **8**.\n\n**Reflection and Check:**  \nLet me verify this by checking if the positive and negative terms balance correctly.\n\n- Adding negative terms:  \n  \\(-8 + 4 = -4\\)  \n  \\(-4 - 2 = -6\\)\n\n- Adding positive terms:  \n  \\(-6 + 2 = -4\\)  \n  \\(-4 + 4 = 0\\)  \n  \\(0 + 8 = 8\\)\n\n**It looks correct. The negative and positive terms balance out to give a total of 8.**\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\nEven though the individual evaluation worked, **let's see if there's a quicker way by grouping the terms.**\n\n#### **Alternative Strategy: Grouping Positive and Negative Terms**\n\nMaybe I can group the positive and negative terms to simplify the addition.\n\n1. **Group Negative Terms:**\n   \\[\n   (-2)^{3} + (-2)^{2} + (-2)^{1} = -8 + 4 - 2 = -6\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Group Positive Terms:**\n   \\[\n   2^{1} + 2^{2} + 2^{3} = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Add the Two Sums Together:**\n   \\[\n   -6 + 14 = 8\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis grouping method also gives the same total\u2014**8**. **It seems more efficient** because it reduces the number of addition steps.\n\n**Checking:**  \nLet me double-check:\n\n- Negative group: \\(-8 + 4 = -4\\), \\(-4 - 2 = -6\\)\n- Positive group: \\(2 + 4 = 6\\), \\(6 + 8 = 14\\)\n- Combined: \\(-6 + 14 = 8\\)\n\n**It\u2019s confirmed. Both methods yield the same correct answer.**\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies:\n\n1. **Evaluating Each Term Individually:** This straightforward method worked, but it involved more steps.\n   \n2. **Grouping Positive and Negative Terms:** This approach simplified the addition process and was more efficient.\n\n**Lesson Learned:**  \nGrouping related terms can simplify calculations, especially when dealing with both negative and positive exponents. It\u2019s always good to brainstorm and see if there\u2019s a more efficient path.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe sum is **8**.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nI started by evaluating each term individually to ensure accuracy, then realized grouping could simplify the process. By checking and verifying at each step, I ensured the correctness of the final answer. This step-by-step approach, with continuous reflection and adjustment, led to an efficient and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Recall that $(-a)^{n}=a^n$ for even $n$ and $(-a)^{n}=-a^n$ for odd $n$. This means that $(-2)^{3}=-2^{3}$, $(-2)^2=2^2$, and $(-2)^1=-2^1.$ Additionally, any number added to its opposite is equal to zero, so $-2^3+2^3=0$. Now we can use the commutative property of addition to obtain  \\begin{align*}\n(-2)^{3}+(-2)^{2}&+(-2)^{1}+2^{1}+2^{2}+2^{3}\\\\\n&=-2^{3}+2^{2}+(-2^{1})+2^{1}+2^{2}+2^{3}\\\\\n&=-2^{3}+2^{3}+(-2^{1})+2^{1}+2^{2}+2^{2}\\\\\n&=0+2^{2}+2^{2}\\\\\n&=4+4\\\\\n&=\\boxed{8}.\n\\end{align*}"
