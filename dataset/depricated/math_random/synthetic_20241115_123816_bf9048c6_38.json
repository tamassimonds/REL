    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's make it as human-like as possible, complete with initial thoughts, explorations, and checks along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I see the expression \\(\\sqrt[3]{2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 11^3}\\), I recognize it's a cube root of a product of prime powers. My initial reaction is that this might involve simplifying exponents or perhaps using properties of cube roots and exponents. It reminds me of problems where you break down exponents inside roots.\n\nBut to be sure, let's brainstorm a bit:\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Simplify inside the cube root by combining exponents.\n- **Strategy 2:** Separate the cube root across different primes.\n- **Strategy 3:** Use the property of cube roots to pull out whole cubes.\n\nWait, before picking one, let's list the pros and cons:\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Might simplify quickly, but combining exponents could get messy.\n- **Strategy 2:** Could make it easier by handling each prime separately, but might take longer.\n- **Strategy 3:** Looks straightforward, but I'm not sure if all components are perfect cubes.\n\nMaybe starting with **Strategy 2**\u2014separating the cube root across different primes\u2014would be a good middle ground. This way, I can handle each part individually and see if any parts simplify nicely.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Strategy 2 \u2013 Separating the Cube Root**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's apply the property of cube roots to break it down:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 11^3} = \\sqrt[3]{2^6} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{3^3} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{11^3}\n\\]\n\nThis seems like a good start because it allows me to deal with each prime factor individually. Now, let's simplify each component.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Simplifying \\(\\sqrt[3]{2^6}\\):**\n   - Recall that \\(2^6 = (2^2)^3 \\cdot 2^0 = 4^3 \\cdot 2^0\\).\n   - So, \\(\\sqrt[3]{2^6} = 2^2 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying \\(\\sqrt[3]{3^3}\\):**\n   - This is straightforward: \\(\\sqrt[3]{3^3} = 3\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying \\(\\sqrt[3]{11^3}\\):**\n   - Again, straightforward: \\(\\sqrt[3]{11^3} = 11\\).\n\n**Intermediate Check:**\nMultiplying these together:\n\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11 = 12 \\cdot 11 = 132\n\\]\n\nWait, let me verify each step:\n\n- \\(2^6\\) as \\(4^3\\) is correct since \\(4^3 = 64\\), and indeed, \\(64\\) divided by \\(2^3 = 8\\) leaves \\(8\\), which is \\(2^3\\).\n- \\(\\sqrt[3]{3^3} = 3\\) is obvious.\n- \\(\\sqrt[3]{11^3} = 11\\) is also clear.\n\nEverything checks out so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let's reflect if this approach is correct and whether there's a more efficient way.\n\nIs there a possibility I could simplify further? Perhaps combining the cube roots differently or checking if the entire expression under the cube root is a perfect cube.\n\nBut looking back, simplifying each prime separately seems the most straightforward and aligns well with exponent properties.\n\n**Alternative Strategy Check:**\nMaybe I could use the property \\(\\sqrt[3]{a^3} = a\\) directly for each prime raised to a power divisible by 3. However, only \\(3^3\\) and \\(11^3\\) are perfect cubes here individually.\n\nStrategy 1\u2014simplifying inside the root by combining exponents\u2014might not work well because \\(2^6\\) isn't a perfect cube on its own.\n\nSo, sticking with Strategy 2 seems best.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAfter breaking down each component and verifying the calculations, the product of the simplified cube roots is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 11^3} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11 = 132\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\nDoes this number make sense?\n\n- **Calculation Check:** \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\), and \\(12 \\times 11 = 132\\). Step-by-step multiplication confirms the result.\n- **Conceptual Check:** Each cube root was simplified correctly, and the properties of exponents were applied accurately.\n\nEverything aligns, and the answer seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy starting with brainstorming different strategies, exploring each step methodically, and continuously checking my work, I've determined that:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 11^3} = \\boxed{132}\n\\]\n\nThis approach ensured that each part of the expression was handled correctly, leading to a final answer that makes sense both numerically and conceptually.",
