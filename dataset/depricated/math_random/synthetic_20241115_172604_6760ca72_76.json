    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies and exploring my initial thoughts. It's important to think out loud and reflect often, just like I would if I were tackling this problem on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Brainstorming**\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nLooking at the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots\\right)=1+\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{x^2}+\\frac{1}{x^3}+\\cdots\n\\]\n\nI notice that both sides involve infinite series. This reminds me of geometric series. In fact, both expressions look like they could be the product of two series.\n\n**Potential Strategies:**\n\n1. **Evaluate the Infinite Series on the Left Side:** Perhaps by recognizing them as geometric series.\n2. **Use the Product of Two Series Formula:** Maybe there's a formula that relates the product of two infinite series to another series.\n3. **Simplify Both Sides Separately:** Try simplifying both sides to see if they match after some manipulation.\n\n**Wait a Moment...**  \nBefore jumping in, I should confirm if these series on the left side indeed converge and can be simplified using geometric series formulas. It's essential to ensure that the series are valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluating the First Series**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's examine the first series:  \n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\cdots\n\\]  \nThis looks like a standard geometric series with a **common ratio** \\( r = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n**Geometric Series Formula:**  \nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( S \\) is the sum,\n- \\( a \\) is the first term,\n- \\( r \\) is the common ratio with \\( |r| < 1 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- First term (\\( a \\)) = 1\n- Common ratio (\\( r \\)) = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nS_1 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, the sum converges to 2, which aligns with the geometric series formula.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGreat, the first series converges to 2. This seems correct. Let's move on to the second series.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating the Second Series**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's look at the second series:  \n\\[\n1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{8} + \\cdots\n\\]  \nThis also resembles a geometric series, but the common ratio is negative.\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- First term (\\( a \\)) = 1\n- Common ratio (\\( r \\)) = \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nApplying the geometric series formula:\n\n\\[\nS_2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (-\\frac{1}{2})} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Wait, What?**  \nHmm, the sum converges to \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). Let me quickly verify:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{8} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}\n\\]\n\nContinuing this pattern, the terms add up to approach \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), which is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense. The alternating series converges to \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). Now, let's multiply the two sums together.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Multiplying the Two Series**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe need to find the product of the two series:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes multiplying these two make sense? Yes, if both series converge, their product should also converge to a specific value.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAlright, the product of the two series is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\). Now, according to the equation, this equals the series on the right side. Let's simplify the right side.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Simplifying the Right Side**\n\n**The Right Side:**  \n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2} + \\frac{1}{x^3} + \\cdots\n\\]  \nThis series also looks like a geometric series. Let's identify the first term and the common ratio.\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- First term (\\( a \\)) = 1\n- Common ratio (\\( r \\)) = \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\)\n\n**Condition for Convergence:**  \nFor this series to converge, \\( |r| < 1 \\), which means \\( |x| > 1 \\).\n\n**Geometric Series Formula:**  \nApplying the formula:\n\n\\[\nS_{\\text{right}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{x}} = \\frac{x}{x - 1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the right side simplifies to \\( \\frac{x}{x - 1} \\). Now, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{x}{x - 1}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving for \\( x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe need to solve the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{x}{x - 1}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**  \nLet's cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n4(x - 1) = 3x\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\n4x - 4 = 3x\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 3x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n4x - 3x = 4 \\\\\nx = 4\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes \\( x = 4 \\) make sense in the context of the series? Yes, since \\( |x| = 4 > 1 \\), the series converges.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe solution \\( x = 4 \\) seems valid. Let me quickly verify if this satisfies the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe should substitute \\( x = 4 \\) back into the right side to ensure it equals \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \nSubstituting \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nThis is a geometric series with:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( r = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n\nSum:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThe sum of the right side series is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), which matches the left side's product. Perfect!\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe solution \\( x = 4 \\) is correct. The left side equals \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), and the right side also simplifies to \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) when \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBy evaluating both series on the left side and recognizing them as geometric series, we were able to multiply their sums to find \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\). Setting this equal to the simplified right side series allowed us to solve for \\( x = 4 \\). Throughout the process, confirming each step ensured the solution's validity.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Identifying series types is crucial for simplification.\n- Cross-multiplying was an effective strategy to solve for \\( x \\).\n- Verifying the solution by substitution ensures accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\nx = 4\n\\]",
