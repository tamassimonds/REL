    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's see where this journey takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, here's the problem:\n\n> The six faces of a three-inch wooden cube are each painted red. The cube is then cut into one-inch cubes along the lines shown in the diagram. How many of the one-inch cubes have red paint on at least two faces?\n\nAlright, let's take a moment to digest this.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving cubes and surface areas that I've seen before. Cutting a larger cube into smaller cubes and analyzing how many smaller ones have paint on multiple faces\u2014yeah, I've dealt with that kind of scenario previously.\n  \n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Count by Analyzing Different Types of Smaller Cubes:**\n     - Maybe determine how many one-inch cubes are corner cubes, edge cubes, face cubes, and interior cubes.\n  2. **Visualizing the Cube:**\n     - Try to visualize or sketch the cube to see where the painted faces are.\n  3. **Mathematical Approach:**\n     - Use mathematical formulas related to cube geometry to calculate the number of cubes with paint on multiple faces.\n  \n- **Exploring Which Strategy to Start With:**\n  - **Visualizing the Cube:** I think starting with a visual or mental model might help me get a clearer picture. If that doesn\u2019t work, I can switch to counting strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Visualizing the Cube**\n\nLet me try to picture the 3-inch cube being cut down to 1-inch cubes.\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - A 3-inch cube has sides of 3 inches. When cut into 1-inch cubes, each side will have 3 smaller cubes.\n  - This means the larger cube is divided into \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\) smaller cubes.\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - Wait, 27 sounds like the right number for a cube with sides divided into 1-inch segments. Each smaller cube will have its own set of faces exposed.\n\n- **Check:**\n  - **Quick Check:** Does 27 make sense? Yes, because \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\).\n\nFeeling good so far! Let's move on.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Different Types of One-Inch Cubes**\n\nNow, I need to categorize these 27 smaller cubes based on how many of their faces are painted.\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - **Corner Cubes:** These are at the corners of the larger cube. Each corner has three faces painted.\n  - **Edge Cubes:** These are along the edges but not at the corners. Each edge has one cube at the center with two faces painted.\n  - **Face Cubes:** These are on the faces but not on the edges. Each face has one cube in the center with only one face painted.\n  - **Interior Cubes:** These are completely inside, with no paint at all.\n\n- **Brainstorming:**\n  - **Counting Corner Cubes:** There are 8 corners in a cube.\n  - **Counting Edge Cubes:** Each edge has 1 center cube (not counting corners), and there are 12 edges total.\n  - **Counting Face Cubes:** Each face has a center cube, and there are 6 faces.\n  - **Interior Cubes:** The remaining cubes that aren't on the surface.\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - Hmm, maybe I need to visualize this more clearly. Let me try to draw it out mentally or sketch it briefly.\n\n- **Sketching Help:**\n  - **Corner:** 8 cubes, each with 3 faces painted.\n  - **Edge:** 12 edges \u00d7 1 cube = 12 cubes, each with 2 faces painted.\n  - **Face:** 6 faces \u00d7 1 cube = 6 cubes, each with 1 face painted.\n  - **Interior:** Total 27 cubes - (8 + 12 + 6) = 1 cube, with no paint.\n\n- **Check:**\n  - **Quick Check:** Does the total add up? \n    - \\(8\\) (corner) + \\(12\\) (edge) + \\(6\\) (face) + \\(1\\) (interior) = \\(27\\). \n    - Yes, it matches.\n\nI think I'm on the right track. Let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Counting One-Inch Cubes with Red Paint on At Least Two Faces**\n\nNow, I need to focus only on the cubes that have paint on at least two faces.\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - **Cubic Corners:** Each corner cube has three faces painted, so they all qualify.\n  - **Edge Cubes:** Only the edge cubes have exactly two faces painted. \n  - **Face Cubes:** Each face cube has only one face painted, so they don\u2019t qualify.\n  - **Interior Cube:** No paint at all, so doesn't qualify.\n\n- **Counting:**\n  - **Corner Cubes:** 8 cubes \u00d7 3 faces = 8 cubes with three painted faces.\n  - **Edge Cubes:** 12 cubes \u00d7 2 faces = 12 cubes with two painted faces.\n\n- **Total:**\n  - \\(8\\) (from corners) + \\(12\\) (from edges) = \\(20\\) cubes.\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - Wait, does this make sense? Let me double-check my counts.\n  \n- **Checking Corner Cubes:**\n  - Yes, there are 8 corners, each with three faces painted. Total: 8 cubes.\n\n- **Checking Edge Cubes:**\n  - There are 12 edges, and each has one 1-inch cube at the center with two faces painted. Total: 12 cubes.\n\n- **Final Count:**\n  - **Cubes with Paint on At Least Two Faces:** \\(8 + 12 = 20\\).\n\nHmm, let me pause and think. Does this number seem reasonable?\n\n- **Quick Check:** \n  - The larger cube had all its sides painted, so cutting it into smaller cubes should still reflect the surface areas. \n  - Having 20 cubes with at least two faces painted seems plausible considering the structure.\n\nStill, I should verify if I'm missing anything.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Cross-Verification with Different Approach**\n\nAlright, let me try a different strategy to ensure my count is accurate.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy: Calculate Total Painted Faces and Divide by Two**\n\n  - **Thought Process:**\n    - Each painted surface has cubes on corners (3 faces), edges (2 faces), and faces (1 face).\n    - Since each face is counted twice (once for each face it is painted), I can sum up the contributions from each type and divide by two to avoid double-counting.\n\n  - **Calculations:**\n    - **Corners:** 8 cubes \u00d7 3 faces = 24\n    - **Edges:** 12 cubes \u00d7 2 faces = 24\n    - **Faces:** 6 cubes \u00d7 1 face = 6\n    - **Total Painted Faces:** \\(24 + 24 + 6 = 54\\)\n    - **Divided by Two:** \\(54 / 2 = 27\\)\n\n  - **Reflection:**\n    - Wait a minute, dividing by two gives me the total number of cubes, but I was originally counting only those with at least two faces painted. This doesn't align directly.\n\n  - **Mistake Identification:**\n    - Ahh, I see the issue. Dividing by two was intended to find the total number of distinct painted surfaces, but since each one-inch cube's faces are independent, this strategy doesn\u2019t directly apply here.\n\n  - **Conclusion:**\n    - This approach isn't helpful for this specific problem.\n\n- **Realization:**\n  - **Strategy Shift Needed:** Instead of looking at total painted faces, focusing on the types of smaller cubes directly is more straightforward.\n\n  - **Returning to Initial Approach:** Let's stick with the initial categorization and ensure it's correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Verification of Initial Approach**\n\nLet's finalize the count using the initial strategy and make sure everything adds up perfectly.\n\n- **Re-evaluating Each Category:**\n  \n  - **Corner Cubes:**\n    - **Number:** 8\n    - **Faces Painted:** 3 each\n    - **Total:** \\(8 \u00d7 3 = 24\\)\n  \n  - **Edge Cubes:**\n    - **Number:** 12\n    - **Faces Painted:** 2 each\n    - **Total:** \\(12 \u00d7 2 = 24\\)\n\n  - **Face Cubes:**\n    - **Number:** 6\n    - **Faces Painted:** 1 each\n    - **Total:** \\(6 \u00d7 1 = 6\\)\n\n  - **Interior Cube:**\n    - **Number:** 1\n    - **Faces Painted:** 0 each\n    - **Total:** \\(1 \u00d7 0 = 0\\)\n\n- **Adding Up:**\n  - \\(24 + 24 + 6 + 0 = 54\\)\n\n- **Divided by Two:**\n  - Since each painted surface is counted for each cube's face, to find distinct painted surfaces, dividing by two makes sense.\n  \n- **Total Distinct Painted Surfaces:**\n  - \\(54 / 2 = 27\\)\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - This aligns with the total number of smaller cubes, confirming that each one-inch cube has its painted faces counted accurately.\n\n- **Final Count of Cubes with At Least Two Faces Painted:**\n  - **Corner Cubes:** 8\n  - **Edge Cubes:** 12\n  - **Total:** \\(8 + 12 = 20\\)\n\nHmm, initially, I counted only 20 cubes with at least two faces painted. But through cross-verification, I realized that the total number of distinct painted surfaces is 27, aligning with the total number of one-inch cubes.\n\n- **Realization:**\n  - **Strategy Adjustment Needed:** I must have miscounted in the initial approach. Let me delve deeper to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Error Detection:**\n  - Perhaps I overlooked some cubes or misclassified them.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Re-examining the Edge Cubes**\n\nLet me focus on the edge cubes to see if I counted them correctly.\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - Each edge of the larger cube has one center one-inch cube with two faces painted.\n  - There are 12 edges in total.\n\n- **Counting:**\n  - **Edge Cubes:** 12 cubes, each with two faces painted.\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - Wait, earlier, I counted 12 edge cubes, but now I'm getting 12 cubes with two faces. \n  - **Confusion:** Are these the same? \n\n- **Realization:**\n  - **Wait!** The edge cubes already account for their two faces in the total painted surfaces.\n  - **Mistake Identified:** I shouldn't double-count these.\n\n- **Adjusting Count:**\n  - The edge cubes were already included in the count of 27 distinct painted surfaces. Therefore, adding them separately would inflate the count.\n\n- **Conclusion:**\n  - **Correct Count:** 20 cubes with at least two faces painted (8 corners + 12 edges).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully examining each step and cross-verifying with different strategies, the number of one-inch cubes with red paint on at least two faces is **20**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Initial Approach Validity:** The initial strategy of categorizing cubes by their position (corners, edges, faces, interior) was indeed correct.\n  \n- **Error Identification:** Initially, the count of 20 seemed low compared to the total number of distinct painted surfaces (27). However, upon realizing that the edge cubes were already accounted for in the total surface count, the initial count aligns perfectly.\n\n- **Key Takeaways:**\n  - **Careful Categorization:** Understanding the cube's geometry is crucial.\n  - **Cross-Verification:** Testing different strategies helps identify and correct errors.\n  - **Attention to Detail:** Ensuring no double-counting or overlooked cubes ensures accuracy.\n\nFeeling satisfied with the solution now. I can confidently say that **20** one-inch cubes have red paint on at least two faces.",

  "ground_truth": "Only the $8$ corners of the cube have three faces painted red. Each edge has one cube that has $2$ faces painted red. There are $12$ edges, so $12$ cubes have $2$ faces painted red. Each of the six faces has only the center cube painted on exactly $1$ face, and the single cube in the center of the three-inch cube is the only one with no faces painted.
