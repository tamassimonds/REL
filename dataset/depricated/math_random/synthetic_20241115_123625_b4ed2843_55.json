    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's treat this like a human would tackle a real-world problem, complete with initial confusion, dead ends, and those \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst thoughts:  \nOkay, we're asked to find \\(\\tan Y\\) in a right triangle. I see the triangle has a right angle at \\(X\\), with sides labeled \\(24\\), \\(7\\), and \\(25\\). The sides \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) are located at the coordinates \\((24,0)\\) and \\((0,7)\\), respectively.  \n\nWait, so \\(Y\\) is at \\((24, 0)\\) and \\(Z\\) is at \\((0, 7)\\)? That makes sense because \\(Z\\) is vertically above \\(X\\) at \\((0, 0)\\). Alright, I need to find \\(\\tan Y\\), which is the tangent of angle \\(Y\\).\n\nRecall that the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. But which sides are which here? Let me think this through.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Sides**\n\nHmm, let's see. Angle \\(Y\\) is at point \\((24, 0)\\), so I need to determine which side is opposite to \\(Y\\) and which is adjacent.\n\n- The **opposite side** to angle \\(Y\\) would be the side that does not include \\(Y\\) and is across from it.\n- The **adjacent side** would be the side next to angle \\(Y\\), excluding the hypotenuse.\n\nGiven the coordinates:\n\n- \\(X = (0, 0)\\)\n- \\(Y = (24, 0)\\)\n- \\(Z = (0, 7)\\)\n\nI know that:\n\n- Side \\(XY\\) is horizontal, along the x-axis, with length \\(24\\).\n- Side \\(XZ\\) is vertical, along the y-axis, with length \\(7\\).\n- Side \\(YZ\\) is the hypotenuse, with length \\(25\\).\n\nSo, for angle \\(Y\\):\n\n- **Opposite side**: \\(XZ = 7\\)\n- **Adjacent side**: \\(XY = 24\\)\n\nThat makes sense. Now, I can use these sides to find \\(\\tan Y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\(\\tan Y\\)**\n\nThought process:  \nTangent is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. So,  \n\\[\n\\tan Y = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{XZ}{XY} = \\frac{7}{24}\n\\]\n\nWait a second. Let me double-check this. Does it align with the definition of tangent? Yes, tangent is indeed the ratio of the opposite to the adjacent side for a given angle in a triangle. Since I've identified the sides correctly, this seems right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Reflecting on the Solution**\n\nDoes \\(\\tan Y = \\frac{7}{24}\\) make sense?  \n- The ratio \\(\\frac{7}{24}\\) is less than 1, which is typical for an angle less than \\(45^\\circ\\).  \n- Given that \\(Z\\) is at \\((0, 7)\\) and \\(Y\\) is at \\((24, 0)\\), angle \\(Y\\) is indeed less than \\(45^\\circ\\).  \n- This aligns with what I expect.\n\nConclusion:  \n\\(\\tan Y = \\frac{7}{24}\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\nWait, let's see if there are other methods to verify this. Maybe using the Pythagorean theorem or trigonometric identities?\n\n**Alternative Idea:**  \nCould I use the Pythagorean theorem to confirm the lengths of the sides?  \nBut wait, the lengths are already given as \\(7\\), \\(24\\), and \\(25\\), and they satisfy the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n7^2 + 24^2 = 49 + 576 = 625 = 25^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the sides indeed follow the Pythagorean theorem, confirming it's a right triangle.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNo need for additional calculations since the given lengths already satisfy the theorem. The initial approach seems robust.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Check**\n\nLet me quickly verify:\n\n- I assigned the correct sides relative to angle \\(Y\\).\n- The ratio \\(\\frac{7}{24}\\) is correctly calculated.\n- The properties of the triangle (Pythagorean theorem) are satisfied.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\tan Y = \\frac{7}{24}\\)\n\n---\n\n**Recap of the Process:**  \n- **Started by understanding the question** and identifying the sides relative to angle \\(Y\\).\n- **Calculated \\(\\tan Y\\)** using the definition of tangent.\n- **Reflected on the solution** to ensure it made sense.\n- **Explored alternative strategies** to verify correctness.\n- **Conducted a final check** to confirm all steps were accurate.\n\nThis approach ensured a thorough and accurate solution, mimicking human problem-solving with brainstorming, reflection, and verification at each step.",
