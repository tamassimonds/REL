    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were working through it myself.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this question, I notice it's about finding an angle in a triangle where altitudes intersect. The given angles are \\(\\angle BAC = 46^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle ABC = 71^\\circ\\). \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Triangle Properties:** I remember that in any triangle, the sum of angles is \\(180^\\circ\\). \n- **Altitudes and Orthocenter:** Altitudes intersect at the orthocenter (\\(H\\)). Could properties related to the orthocenter help here?\n- **Alternate Interior Angles:** Maybe something with parallel lines could work?\n- **Isogonal Conjugates:** This seems beyond the current need, but it\u2019s worth keeping in mind for later.\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward **calculating angles within the triangle first** and then exploring how the orthocenter relates to them. \n\nBut wait, before proceeding, let me **double-check** if there are direct properties relating angles at the orthocenter that I might be missing.\n\nAfter reflecting, I remember that the **sum of certain angles around the orthocenter can be useful**, especially with given triangle angles. \n\n### **Step 1: Find the Third Angle of Triangle \\(ABC\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo apply properties of triangles and the orthocenter, I need all three angles of triangle \\(ABC\\). Given that:\n\n\\[\n\\angle BAC = 46^\\circ\n\\]\n\\[\n\\angle ABC = 71^\\circ\n\\]\n\nI can find \\(\\angle ACB\\) using the angle sum property of triangles:\n\n\\[\n\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\angle ACB = 180^\\circ - \\angle BAC - \\angle ABC\n\\]\n\\[\n\\angle ACB = 180^\\circ - 46^\\circ - 71^\\circ = 63^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so now I have all the angles:\n\n\\[\n\\angle A = 46^\\circ, \\quad \\angle B = 71^\\circ, \\quad \\angle C = 63^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThis seems correct since the sum is \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n46^\\circ + 71^\\circ + 63^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nPerfect, the calculations are correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Role of the Orthocenter \\(H\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe orthocenter \\(H\\) is the point where all three altitudes intersect. I remember that in triangle geometry, certain relationships exist between the angles at the orthocenter and the vertices of the triangle.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n- **Angle Relationships at the Orthocenter:** There\u2019s a property that relates the angles of triangle \\(ABC\\) with those at \\(H\\).\n- **Applying the Law of Sines or Cosines:** While these laws are essential, they might complicate things without the lengths.\n- **Are there Parallel Lines or Similar Triangles?** Not immediately apparent, but worth considering if the direct angle relationship doesn\u2019t work.\n\nGiven that I have the triangle's angles and need to find \\(\\angle AHB\\), I'm thinking the **relationship between the angles of the triangle and those at the orthocenter** might be the most straightforward.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Angle Relationships at the Orthocenter**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThere\u2019s a known property in triangle geometry:\n\n\\[\n\\angle AHB = 180^\\circ - \\angle C\n\\]\n\nThis relates the angle at the orthocenter to one of the angles in the triangle. Since I have \\(\\angle C = 63^\\circ\\), I can use this directly.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\angle AHB = 180^\\circ - \\angle C = 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ = 117^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems too straightforward. Let me **double-check** if this property is applicable here. \n\n**Check:**\n\nThis property holds for any triangle when computing \\(\\angle AHB\\). It\u2019s derived from considering the angles around point \\(H\\) and how they relate to the triangle's angles.\n\n\\[\n\\angle AHB + \\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 360^\\circ\n\\]\nBut since \\(\\angle AHB\\) and \\(\\angle C\\) are supplementary due to the straight line through \\(H\\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\angle AHB = 180^\\circ - \\angle C\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\angle C = 63^\\circ\\), the calculation is correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nDoes it make sense that \\(\\angle AHB = 117^\\circ\\)? Let me think about it:\n\n- The sum of angles around point \\(H\\) should be \\(360^\\circ\\).\n- In triangle \\(ABC\\), the sum is \\(180^\\circ\\), but since \\(H\\) lies within and altitudes intersect, certain angles complement each other.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis aligns with the property that \\(\\angle AHB\\) is supplementary to \\(\\angle C\\). Since the altitudes create right angles with the sides, at least in right triangles, this relationship holds more generally.\n\n**Check:**\n\nReapplying the property:\n\n\\[\n\\angle AHB = 180^\\circ - \\angle C = 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ = 117^\\circ\n\\]\n\nEvery check confirms that the approach is correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nInitially, I considered exploring multiple strategies, like using the Law of Sines or looking for similar triangles. However, recognizing the direct property relating the angles at the orthocenter to those of triangle \\(ABC\\) made the solution straightforward.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt's always good to **verify** if such properties are applicable. In this case, understanding the relationship between the orthocenter and the triangle's angles led directly to the correct answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{117^\\circ}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\angle AHB\\) is \\(117^\\circ\\). The step-by-step approach, checking properties, and reflecting on each part ensure the solution is accurate and methodical.",
