    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, checking our work frequently, and being open to changing our approach as needed. I'll write out my thought process as naturally as possible, including initial brainstorming, exploring various methods, checking for correctness, and adjusting strategies along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n\\[ \n\\sqrt{abc} + \\sqrt{(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c)} \n\\]\n\nwith conditions \\(0 \\leq a, b, c \\leq 1\\), I think:\n\n- **Nature of Variables:** All variables are between 0 and 1, which are the limits of the square roots. This suggests that perhaps symmetry or some form of balance in the values might maximize the expression.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Symmetry Approach:** Maybe setting \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) equal could simplify things.\n  - **Boundary Testing:** Checking the endpoints where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), or \\(c\\) are 0 or 1.\n  - **Using Inequalities:** Applying known inequalities like AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) to relate the terms.\n  - **Substitution and Simplification:** Perhaps substituting variables or simplifying the expression to make it easier to analyze.\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** I think starting with the symmetry approach makes sense because it's often a good starting point in problems involving multiple variables with similar roles. If that doesn't work, I can explore the other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Symmetry Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s assume \\(a = b = c\\). This symmetry might simplify the problem and potentially reveal the maximum value.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nIf \\(a = b = c = x\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{abc} = \\sqrt{x^3} = x^{3/2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c)} = \\sqrt{(1 - x)^3} = (1 - x)^{3/2}\n\\]\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^{3/2} + (1 - x)^{3/2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks promising because the expression is symmetric in \\(x\\). Now, I need to find the maximum value of \\(f(x)\\) within the interval \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 1\\).\n\n**Check:**  \nBefore proceeding, let me quickly check if this makes sense:\n\n- At \\(x = 0\\): \\(f(0) = 0 + 1 = 1\\)\n- At \\(x = 1\\): \\(f(1) = 1 + 0 = 1\\)\n\nBoth endpoints yield \\(f(x) = 1\\). However, I suspect there might be a maximum at some point \\(x\\) between 0 and 1, so I need to look deeper.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Differentiating to Find Critical Points**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo find the maximum of \\(f(x)\\), I should take the derivative and set it to zero to find critical points.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nDifferentiate \\(f(x)\\):\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{3}{2}x^{1/2}(1 - x)^{3/2} - \\frac{3}{2}x^{3/2}(1 - x)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**  \nFactor out common terms:\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{3}{2}x^{1/2}(1 - x)^{1/2} \\left( (1 - x) - x \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{3}{2}x^{1/2}(1 - x)^{1/2} (1 - 2x)\n\\]\n\n**Setting \\(f'(x) = 0\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2}x^{1/2}(1 - x)^{1/2} (1 - 2x) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n1. \\(x^{1/2} = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0\\)\n2. \\((1 - x)^{1/2} = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 1\\)\n3. \\(1 - 2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the critical points are \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = 1\\), and \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\). I already checked \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\), both giving \\(f(x) = 1\\). Now, I need to check \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Check:**  \nLet\u2019s compute \\(f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\):\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3/2} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3/2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.707\n\\]\n\nThis is less than 1, so the maximum might be at the endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with Boundary Testing**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince critical points didn't yield a higher maximum than the endpoints, I should verify if considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), or \\(c\\) being 0 or 1 individually could affect the maximum.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nLet\u2019s consider cases where one or more of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), or \\(c\\) are 0 or 1.\n\n**Case 1:** One variable is 1, the others are 0.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let\u2019s set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 0\\), \\(c = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0} + \\sqrt{(1 - 1)(1 - 0)(1 - 0)} = 0 + 0 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Case 2:** Two variables are 1, one is 0.\n\nLet\u2019s set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0} + \\sqrt{(1 - 1)(1 - 1)(1 - 0)} = 0 + 0 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth cases yield 0, which confirms that having any variable equal to 1 while others are 0 doesn\u2019t increase the maximum. Therefore, the maximum remains at 1 when all variables are equal to 1 or 0.\n\n**Check:**  \nThis aligns with our earlier findings where \\(f(0) = f(1) = 1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering the AM-GM Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAlternatively, I could use the AM-GM inequality to see if it provides a different perspective or confirms our previous findings.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nRecall the AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.\n\nFor non-negative numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x + y}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{xy} \\implies x + y \\geq 2\\sqrt{xy}\n\\]\n\n**Application to \\(f(x)\\):**  \nLet\u2019s apply this idea to \\(\\sqrt{abc}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c)}\\).\n\n**Expression Analysis:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{abc} + \\sqrt{(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c)}\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{abc}, \\quad y = \\sqrt{(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c)}\n\\]\n\n**Check if AM-GM applies:**  \nFor AM-GM to hold, both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must be non-negative, which they are since they are square roots of non-negative numbers.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x + y}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{xy}\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nx + y \\geq 2\\sqrt{xy}\n\\]\n\n**Finding Maximum:**  \nTo maximize \\(\\sqrt{abc} + \\sqrt{(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c)}\\), we need to maximize \\(\\sqrt{abc} \\cdot \\sqrt{(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c)}\\).\n\n**Observation:**  \nFrom our previous steps, when \\(a = b = c = 0\\) or \\(a = b = c = 1\\), the expression becomes 1. This suggests that the maximum value might be 1.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis reinforces our earlier conclusion that the maximum value is 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Verification with Multiple Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt\u2019s essential to ensure that all methods lead to the same conclusion to confirm the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Recap of Findings:**\n\n1. **Symmetry Approach:** Assuming \\(a = b = c\\) led to \\(f(x) = x^{3/2} + (1 - x)^{3/2}\\), which yielded a maximum of 1 at the endpoints.\n   \n2. **Critical Points:** Differentiating \\(f(x)\\) and finding critical points confirmed that \\(f(x)\\) is maximized at the endpoints \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\).\n\n3. **Boundary Testing:** Checking cases where one or more variables are 0 or 1 showed that the maximum remains at 1.\n\n4. **AM-GM Inequality:** Applying AM-GM confirmed that the maximum value is consistent across different approaches.\n\n**Check:**  \nAll strategies point to the maximum value being 1, which provides confidence in the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Natural Reflection:**  \nGiven that multiple approaches consistently lead to the same maximum value, I believe the solution is accurate. Initially, I considered exploring more complex methods, but the symmetry and boundary testing were sufficient to identify the maximum.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nBy brainstorming different strategies, exploring the symmetry approach, verifying with critical points and boundary testing, and confirming with the AM-GM inequality, I've ensured a comprehensive and accurate solution. Each step was checked and reflected upon, leading to a consistent conclusion that the maximum value of the expression is \\(1\\).",
