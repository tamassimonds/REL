I'll brainstorm and think through my initial understanding, explore different strategies, and continuously check my approach to ensure I'm on the right path. Let's see where this takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, it involves an \\(8 \\times 8\\) checkerboard with nine horizontal and nine vertical lines. The goal is to find the ratio of the number of rectangles, \\(r\\), to the number of squares, \\(s\\), and express this ratio as \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers. Finally, we're asked to find \\(m + n\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Familiarity:** This problem reminds me of combinatorial counting, specifically dealing with grids or checkerboards. I think I've encountered similar problems involving counting rectangles or squares on a grid before.\n  \n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  \n  1. **Combinatorial Counting:** Maybe I can count the total number of rectangles and squares using combinations.\n  \n  2. **Geometric Approach:** Consider the properties of squares and rectangles on a grid.\n  \n  3. **Writing Formulas:** Attempt to derive a formula for the number of each.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure which approach will be the most straightforward. Combinatorial counting seems promising, but I need to think it through.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Combinatorial Counting**\n\nLet's start with **Combinatorial Counting**, as it seems the most direct way to handle this problem.\n\n#### **Step 1: Counting Total Rectangles (\\(r\\))**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To form a rectangle on a grid, I need to choose two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. The intersections of these lines define the corners of the rectangle.\n  \n- **Formula:** The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 9 horizontal lines is \\(\\binom{9}{2}\\), and similarly for vertical lines.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\binom{9}{2} \\times \\binom{9}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2} = 36\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr = 36 \\times 36 = 1296\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Does this number make sense? Let me think... Each pair of horizontal lines can be combined with each pair of vertical lines to form a unique rectangle. So, \\(1296\\) seems reasonable.\n\n- **Status:** I'm confident in this part. The total number of rectangles \\(r = 1296\\).\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Counting Total Squares (\\(s\\))**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Squares are a special case of rectangles where the lengths of the sides are equal. To count squares, I need to consider all possible square sizes that can fit within the \\(8 \\times 8\\) grid.\n  \n- **Approach:** For each possible square size, count how many such squares can be placed on the grid.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Square Size 1x1:** Can start at any of the 64 (\\(8 \\times 8\\)) positions.\n\n- **Square Size 2x2:** Can start at any position where both row and column indices are at most \\(7\\) (\\(7 \\times 7\\) = 49 positions).\n\n- **Square Size 3x3:** Can start at positions where both indices are at most \\(6\\) (\\(6 \\times 6\\) = 36 positions).\n\n- **Continue this up to 8x8:**\n\n\\[\ns = 64 + 49 + 36 + 25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 204\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Wait, before finalizing, let me ensure I've counted all squares correctly. For each square size \\(n\\), the number of squares is \\((9-n)^2\\).\n  \n- **Correction:** Oh no, I think I've miscounted. The correct number of \\(n \\times n\\) squares is indeed \\((9-n)^2\\), so:\n\n\\[\n1^2 = 1 \\\\\n2^2 = 4 \\\\\n3^2 = 9 \\\\\n4^2 = 16 \\\\\n5^2 = 25 \\\\\n6^2 = 36 \\\\\n7^2 = 49 \\\\\n8^2 = 64\n\\]\n\nAdding these up:\n\n\\[\ns = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 = 204\n\\]\n\n- **Status:** After checking, the total number of squares \\(s = 204\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculating the Ratio \\(\\frac{s}{r}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have both \\(s\\) and \\(r\\), I can calculate the ratio \\(\\frac{s}{r} = \\frac{204}{1296}\\).\n  \n- **Goal:** Simplify this fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{r} = \\frac{204}{1296}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\n- **Find GCD:** Let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\(204\\) and \\(1296\\).\n\n  \\[\n  204 = 2 \\times 102 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 51 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 17 \\\\\n  1296 = 2 \\times 648 = 2^2 \\times 324 = 2^3 \\times 162 = 2^4 \\times 81 = 2^4 \\times 3^4\n  \\]\n\n  **Common Factors:** Both numbers have \\(2^2\\) and \\(3\\) as common factors.\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{GCD} = 2^2 \\times 3 = 12\n  \\]\n\n- **Divide Numerator and Denominator by GCD:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{204}{12} = 17 \\\\\n  \\frac{1296}{12} = 108\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{s}{r} = \\frac{17}{108}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Is \\(17/108\\) in its simplest form? Let me verify... The numerator \\(17\\) is a prime number, and \\(108\\) doesn't have \\(17\\) as a factor. So, yes, it's simplified.\n\n- **Status:** The ratio \\(\\frac{s}{r} = \\frac{17}{108}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Finding \\(m + n\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The ratio \\(\\frac{s}{r} = \\frac{17}{108}\\), where \\(m = 17\\) and \\(n = 108\\).\n  \n- **Question Asks for:** \\(m + n\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nm + n = 17 + 108 = 125\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Does this final step make sense? Adding \\(17\\) and \\(108\\) gives \\(125\\), which fits the problem's requirements.\n\n- **Status:** The final answer is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough a combinatorial counting approach, I've determined that the ratio of the number of squares to rectangles on an \\(8 \\times 8\\) checkerboard is \\(\\frac{17}{108}\\). Therefore, \\(m + n = 125\\).\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{125}\\)\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:** \n\n- **Brainstorming and Reflection:** Initially, I considered different strategies but settled on combinatorial counting as the most straightforward. Throughout the process, I repeatedly checked my work to catch and correct any miscalculations, like the initial miscount of squares.\n\n- **Check and Balance:** Regular reflections ensured that each step logically followed the previous one, maintaining the integrity of the solution.\n\n- **Learning:** This approach reinforced the importance of verifying each part of a solution, especially in combinatorial problems where multiple counts are involved.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** While combinatorial counting worked well, exploring geometric approaches could provide additional insights, although they might be more complex.\n\nOverall, by methodically exploring, verifying, and reflecting, I navigated through the problem to arrive confidently at the correct answer.",

  "ground_truth": "To determine the two horizontal sides of a rectangle, we have to pick two of the horizontal lines of the checkerboard, or ${9\\choose 2} = 36$. Similarily, there are ${9\\choose 2}$ ways to pick the vertical sides, giving us $r = 1296$ rectangles.\nFor $s$, there are $8^2$ unit squares, $7^2$ of the $2\\times2$ squares, and so on until $1^2$ of the $8\\times 8$ squares. Using the sum of squares formula, that gives us $s=1^2+2^2+\\cdots+8^2=\\dfrac{(8)(8+1)(2\\cdot8+1)}{6}=12*17=204$.\nThus $\\frac sr = \\dfrac{204}{1296}=\\dfrac{17}{108}$, and $m+n=\\boxed{125}$."
