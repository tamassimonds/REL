So, no further calculation is needed here.\n- Just to confirm, using the radius found:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Base Area} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\times 10^2 = \\pi \\times 100 = 100\\pi\n  \\]\n- This matches the given base area, so it's consistent.\n\nReflection:\n- **Is this consistent?** Yes, both methods yield the same base area.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Total Surface Area of the Hemisphere**\n\nThought Process:\n- The **total surface area** (TSA) of a hemisphere is the sum of the curved surface area and the base area:\n  \\[\n  \\text{TSA} = \\text{CSA} + \\text{Base Area} = 200\\pi + 100\\pi = 300\\pi\n  \\]\n  \nCheck:\n- **Does this add up correctly?** Adding \\(200\\pi\\) and \\(100\\pi\\) gives \\(300\\pi\\), which seems correct.\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Approach**\n\nReflection:\n- **Check if the method is correct:** \n  - Used the area of the base to find the radius.\n  - Calculated the curved surface area using the radius.\n  - Added both surface areas to get the total.\n  \n- **Does the final answer make sense?** \n  - A total surface area of \\(300\\pi\\) aligns with the given base area of \\(100\\pi\\) and the calculated curved surface area \\(200\\pi\\).\n\n### **Step 7: Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\nThought Process:\n- **Strategy 2:** Could I have found the total surface area without explicitly calculating the radius?\n  - Maybe by recognizing that the base area relates directly to the radius and using that to find the curved surface area.\n  - However, since Strategy 1 worked straightforwardly, I\u2019ll stick with it.\n\n- **Strategy 3:** Check if there\u2019s a proportion:\n  - The curved surface area is always double the base area in a hemisphere.\n  - Given the base area is \\(100\\pi\\), the curved surface area would be \\(200\\pi\\), and adding the base gives \\(300\\pi\\).\n  \nReflection:\n- **Does this alternative approach confirm the result?** Yes, it aligns with the detailed calculation.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Quick verification:** The radius \\(10\\) makes sense, the curved surface area \\(200\\pi\\) is correct, and the base area \\(100\\pi\\) matches the given data.\n- **Total surface area \\(300\\pi\\)** logically follows from adding both components.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{300\\pi}\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Strategy Used:** Started with finding the radius from the given base area, then calculated the curved surface area, and finally summed both surface areas to get the total.\n- **Alternative Considerations:** Recognized that the curved surface area is double the base area, which provided a quick check.\n- **Verification:** Checked each step to ensure consistency and correctness, leading to a confident final answer.\n\n**Reflection:** By exploring different strategies and verifying each step, I ensured the approach was correct and the final answer accurate.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed, step-by-step approach mirrors human thinking, including brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and confirming each part of the process to arrive at the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the hemisphere's radius be $r$.  The hemisphere's base is a circle with radius $r$; thus, we have $\\pi r^2 = 100\\pi$.  Taking the positive solution for $r$ yields $r = 10$.  The surface area of the curved part of the hemisphere is half the surface area of a sphere with radius 10, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4\\pi (10^2) = 200\\pi$.  The total surface area of the hemisphere is the sum of this curved surface area and the base area, which is $200\\pi+100\\pi=\\boxed{300\\pi}$."
