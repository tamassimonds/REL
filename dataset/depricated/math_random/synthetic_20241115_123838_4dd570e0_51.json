I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking if they're right, reflecting often, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, **$\\frac{3+x(3+x)-3^2}{x-3+x^2}$ for $x=-2$**. \n\nAt first glance, this looks like a **rational expression** with polynomials in both the numerator and denominator. My **initial reaction** is to:\n\n1. **Substitute \\( x = -2 \\)** directly into the expression.\n2. **Simplify** step by step to see if that works.\n3. **Check** if there's a way to **factor** or simplify the expression further before substituting.\n\nBut **wait**, substituting directly can sometimes lead to complex calculations. Maybe simplifying the expression first would make the arithmetic easier.\n\nLet me brainstorm a bit more:\n\n- **Brainstorming Options:**\n  1. **Direct substitution:** Plugging in \\( x = -2 \\) right away.\n  2. **Simplify before substituting:** Factor or simplify the expression to see if terms cancel out.\n  3. **Check for special identities:** See if the numerator or denominator matches any known algebraic identities.\n\nI think starting with **simplifying the expression** looks promising. It might make the numbers more manageable. But I'll keep the **direct substitution** option in mind in case simplification doesn't help much.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify the Expression**\n\nLet me write down the expression again to make sure I'm starting correctly:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3 + x(3 + x) - 3^2}{x - 3 + x^2}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The **numerator** is \\(3 + x(3 + x) - 3^2\\).\n- The **denominator** is \\(x - 3 + x^2\\).\n\nLooking at the numerator, it seems like it could be simplified by expanding \\(x(3 + x)\\). Let's try that:\n\n\\[\nx(3 + x) = 3x + x^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\n3 + 3x + x^2 - 3^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= 3 + 3x + x^2 - 9\n\\]\n\\[\n= x^2 + 3x + (3 - 9)\n\\]\n\\[\n= x^2 + 3x - 6\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Wait, let me double-check this:\n\n- \\(3 - 9\\) is indeed \\(-6\\).\n- So, \\(3 + x(3 + x) - 9\\) simplifies correctly.\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, that seems correct. The numerator simplifies to **\\(x^2 + 3x - 6\\)**. \n\nNow, let's look at the denominator:\n\n\\[\nx - 3 + x^2 = x^2 + x - 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Just rearranged terms for clarity.\n\n**Reflection:** So, both the numerator and denominator are polynomials. No obvious factoring jumps out, but at least the expression is simpler now.\n\nBut wait! **Maybe I should check if there's a common factor between numerator and denominator.** That could simplify things even more.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Factor the Simplified Expression**\n\nLet's see if the numerator \\(x^2 + 3x - 6\\) can be factored.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Quadratic Trinomial:** Look for two numbers that multiply to \\(-6\\) (the constant term) and add to \\(3\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\)).\n\nNumbers that multiply to \\(-6\\) and add to \\(3\\): \n\n\\[\n2 \\times (-3) = -6 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2 + (-3) = -1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Wait, that's not adding to 3, but multiplying correctly.}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Hmm,} \\quad 3 \\times (-2) = -6 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 3 + (-2) = 1\\quad, \\text{but they don't match.}\n\\]\n\n**Realization:** I can't seem to find numbers that work here. **Maybe factoring isn't the right approach.**\n\n**Reflection:** **Wait, perhaps factoring isn't helping.** So, factoring doesn't seem straightforward. Let's move forward with another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Substitute \\( x = -2 \\) into the Simplified Expression**\n\nSince factoring didn\u2019t help, let's go back to **direct substitution** into the simplified expression.\n\n**Expression Now:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2 + 3x - 6}{x^2 + x - 3}\n\\]\n\n**Substituting \\( x = -2 \\):**\n\n**Numerator:**\n\n\\[\n(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6\n\\]\n\\[\n= 4 - 6 - 6\n\\]\n\\[\n= 4 - 12\n\\]\n\\[\n= -8\n\\]\n\n**Denominator:**\n\n\\[\n(-2)^2 + (-2) - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n= 4 - 2 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n= 4 - 5\n\\]\n\\[\n= -1\n\\]\n\n**Simplified Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-8}{-1} = 8\n\\]\n\n**Check:** **Wait**, let me verify each step:\n\n- **Numerator Calculation:**\n  - \\( (-2)^2 = 4 \\)\n  - \\( 3 \\times (-2) = -6 \\)\n  - \\( 4 - 6 - 6 = -8 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **Denominator Calculation:**\n  - \\( (-2)^2 = 4 \\)\n  - \\( (-2) - 3 = -5 \\)\n  - \\( 4 - 5 = -1 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. The substitution works correctly, and the simplified fraction is **8**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Did simplifying the expression help?** Yes, it made direct substitution more manageable.\n- **Was factoring necessary?** No, factoring didn't simplify things further in this case.\n- **Does the answer make sense?** Yes, obtaining a positive value (8) from negative inputs aligns with the nature of the expression.\n\nUltimately, **taking the time to simplify the expression** before substituting was beneficial. It streamlined the calculations and ensured accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer:** \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis walkthrough shows how brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking work frequently, and adapting approaches lead to successfully solving the problem.",
