    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like how I'd approach it if I were solving it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work frequently to make sure I'm on the right track. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question is about finding the acute angle between the hour hand and the minute hand of a 12-hour clock at 6:48. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems where you calculate the positions of the clock hands based on time. I think I've seen something like this before, maybe involving degrees per minute or per hour.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:** \n  1. **Calculate the Position of Each Hand:** Determine where each hand is at 6:48.\n  2. **Find the Difference Between the Two Angles:** Subtract the smaller angle from the larger one to find the acute angle.\n  3. **Check if the Angle Needs Adjustment:** Ensure the angle is indeed acute (less than 90 degrees).\n\n- **First Idea:** Let's start by calculating the position of each hand. This seems straightforward.\n\n- **But Wait:** I'm wondering if there's a quicker way or if I should consider something else, like the total degrees in a circle or the fraction of the hour that's passed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Position of the Minute Hand**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The minute hand completes a full circle (360 degrees) in 60 minutes.\n- So, each minute corresponds to \\( \\frac{360}{60} = 6 \\) degrees.\n- At 48 minutes, the minute hand moves \\( 48 \\times 6 = 288 \\) degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Minute Hand Position} = 48 \\times 6 = 288 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** 288 degrees makes sense because it's close to 360 degrees. Since 48 minutes is near the end of the hour, the minute hand should be nearly at the bottom of the clock.\n\n- **Does This Seem Right?** Yes, this seems correct. Each minute moving 6 degrees adds up properly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Position of the Hour Hand**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, so each hour is \\( \\frac{360}{12} = 30 \\) degrees.\n- But we're not only at 6 o'clock; it's 6:48. This means the hour hand has moved additional degrees beyond 180 degrees (6 hours).\n- Also, the hour hand moves with the minutes, so we need to account for the 48 minutes past 6 o'clock.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Base Position at 6:00:** \n   \\[\n   6 \\times 30 = 180 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Additional Movement Due to Minutes:**\n   - Each minute contributes \\( \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \\) degrees.\n   - So, for 48 minutes:\n     \\[\n     48 \\times 0.5 = 24 \\text{ degrees}\n     \\]\n     \n3. **Total Position of the Hour Hand:**\n   \\[\n   180 + 24 = 204 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Adding 24 degrees to 180 degrees makes sense. It reflects the additional movement of the hour hand as time progresses from 6:00 to 6:48.\n\n- **Does This Seem Right?** Yes, it aligns with how the hour hand should move.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Find the Difference Between the Two Angles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the angle between the two hands, subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle.\n- Since 204 degrees (hour hand) and 288 degrees (minute hand), the difference is:\n  \\[\n  288 - 204 = 84 \\text{ degrees}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 288 - 204 = 84 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** 84 degrees is less than 90 degrees, so it's an acute angle.\n  \n- **Is This Correct?** Yes, 84 degrees fits the criteria for an acute angle.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Spontaneous Check:** Does the method make sense? Calculating each hand's position and finding the difference seems logical.\n  \n- **Possible Mistake:** Could I have miscalculated the movement of the hour hand? Let me double-check the minutes-to-degrees conversion.\n\n- **Rechecking:** Each minute indeed accounts for 0.5 degrees for the hour hand. Multiplying by 48 minutes gives 24 degrees, which adds correctly to 180 degrees.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does Everything Add Up?** Yes, the calculations are consistent, and the angle is acute.\n\n- **Final Insight:** The approach worked well. Starting with the basic positions of each hand and then finding the difference is an effective strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe measure of the acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand at 6:48 is **84 degrees**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy breaking down the problem into manageable steps\u2014calculating the positions of each hand, finding the difference, and verifying the approach\u2014I ensured the solution was accurate. Reflecting and checking throughout helped catch any potential mistakes early, leading to a correct and confident final answer.",
