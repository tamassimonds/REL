    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way, just like I would if I were solving it manually. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first glance at the problem, I see that \\( g(x) \\) is a piecewise function:\n\n\\[\ng(x) = \\begin{cases} \n3x + 6 & \\text{if } x < 0 \\\\\n2x - 13 & \\text{if } x \\geq 0 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThe goal is to find all solutions to the equation \\( g(x) = 3 \\).\n\nWhat stands out to me is the **piecewise nature** of the function. This means that depending on whether \\( x \\) is negative or non-negative, the formula for \\( g(x) \\) changes. So, I might need to handle each case separately.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Separate Each Case:**\n   - Solve \\( 3x + 6 = 3 \\) for \\( x < 0 \\).\n   - Solve \\( 2x - 13 = 3 \\) for \\( x \\geq 0 \\).\n\n2. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Visualize the function to see where \\( g(x) = 3 \\) intersects.\n\n3. **Check for Extraneous Solutions:**\n   - Ensure that solutions found in each case satisfy the original piecewise condition.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\nI think the **separate each case** approach is the most straightforward. The graphical approach might give a visual insight, but it's more time-consuming. Checking for extraneous solutions is always good practice, especially with piecewise functions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the First Case \\( x < 0 \\)**\n\n**Action:**\nLet's tackle the case where \\( x < 0 \\).\n\n**Equation:**\n\\[\n3x + 6 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\n3x + 6 - 6 = 3 - 6 \\\\\n3x = -3 \\\\\nx = \\frac{-3}{3} \\\\\nx = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, I found \\( x = -1 \\), which is less than 0. So, this solution fits the condition of the first piece.\n\n**Check:**\nPlugging \\( x = -1 \\) back into the equation:\n\\[\n3(-1) + 6 = -3 + 6 = 3\n\\]\nThis satisfies \\( g(x) = 3 \\), so the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Second Case \\( x \\geq 0 \\)**\n\n**Action:**\nNow, let's solve the case where \\( x \\geq 0 \\).\n\n**Equation:**\n\\[\n2x - 13 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\n2x - 13 + 13 = 3 + 13 \\\\\n2x = 16 \\\\\nx = \\frac{16}{2} \\\\\nx = 8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nI found \\( x = 8 \\), which is greater than or equal to 0. So, this solution fits the condition of the second piece.\n\n**Check:**\nPlugging \\( x = 8 \\) back into the equation:\n\\[\n2(8) - 13 = 16 - 13 = 3\n\\]\nThis also satisfies \\( g(x) = 3 \\), so the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n**Thoughts:**\nI have two potential solutions: \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\). Both solutions satisfy their respective pieces of the function and the equation \\( g(x) = 3 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth solutions seem valid based on the checks. However, it's always good to double-check if there's a possibility of missing solutions, especially with piecewise functions.\n\n**Random Insight:**\nSince the equation \\( g(x) = 3 \\) only involved solving linear equations within each piece, and both solutions satisfy their conditions, I believe **all solutions have been found**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Solution:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = -1 \\text{ and } x = 8}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion and Final Check**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy solving each case of the piecewise function separately, I've identified \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\) as the solutions to the equation \\( g(x) = 3 \\).\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **Does \\( x = -1 \\) satisfy \\( g(x) = 3 \\)?**\n  \\[\n  3(-1) + 6 = -3 + 6 = 3\n  \\]\n  \u2714\ufe0f Yes.\n\n- **Does \\( x = 8 \\) satisfy \\( g(x) = 3 \\)?**\n  \\[\n  2(8) - 13 = 16 - 13 = 3\n  \\]\n  \u2714\ufe0f Yes.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe solutions are correct and consistent with the conditions of the piecewise function. I don't see any errors or missing solutions.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nInitially, I considered approaching the problem by graphing, but that felt more cumbersome. By focusing on solving each piece individually, I was able to find the correct solutions efficiently. Always reflecting and checking along the way ensured that the solutions were valid.\n\n---\n\nThat's the complete step-by-step process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the correctness of the solutions.",

If $x \\ge 0,$ then we have $2x - 13 = 3,$ which gives $x = 8.$ Since $8 \\ge 0,$ this is a valid solution.\n\nThus, the solutions to the equation are $x = \\boxed{-1, 8}.$"
