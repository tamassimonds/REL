    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, exploring my thoughts, checking along the way, and reflecting often to ensure I'm on the right track. This human-like approach will help me navigate through any uncertainties and arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see that Leigh walked a series of steps in different directions from point A to point B. My immediate thought is that this involves determining the straight-line distance between the two points, which reminds me of problems involving the Pythagorean theorem or vector addition.\n\nBut then I think, wait, maybe it's more about visualizing the path to see how it aligns on a coordinate system. This feels similar to solving for the net displacement by breaking down each leg of the journey.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Coordinate System Approach:** Use a two-dimensional grid where each direction corresponds to movements along the x and y axes. This seems intuitive because it aligns with how we represent vectors.\n\n2. **Vector Addition:** Consider each leg of the walk as a vector and find the resultant vector. This seems like a more advanced method, but maybe overcomplicated for this problem.\n\n3. **Drawing the Path:** Sketching the route to visualize the overall displacement. This might help in understanding the movements better.\n\n4. **Pythagorean Theorem:** After determining the net movements in each direction, use this theorem to find the straight-line distance. This seems like the most straightforward after calculating the net displacements.\n\nI think starting with the **Coordinate System Approach** makes the most sense. If that doesn't work, I'll reconsider and maybe draw the path or think about vector addition.\n\n### **Step 1: Assigning Coordinates**\n\nLet\u2019s assign a coordinate system to make it easier to track the movements.\n\n- **Starting Point A:** Let's assume Leigh begins at the origin, \\( A(0, 0) \\).\n\nNow, I'll apply each movement one by one:\n\n1. **40 yards south:** \n   - Moving south decreases the y-coordinate.\n   - New position: \\( A(0, 0) \\rightarrow A(0, -40) \\)\n\n2. **60 yards west:** \n   - Moving west decreases the x-coordinate.\n   - New position: \\( A(0, -40) \\rightarrow A(-60, -40) \\)\n\n3. **10 yards north:** \n   - Moving north increases the y-coordinate.\n   - New position: \\( A(-60, -40) \\rightarrow A(-60, -30) \\)\n\n4. **20 yards east:** \n   - Moving east increases the x-coordinate.\n   - New position: \\( A(-60, -30) \\rightarrow A(-40, -30) \\)\n\n### **Reflecting on Step 1:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, each movement corresponds correctly to changes in the x and y coordinates. I double-checked the arithmetic: \n\n- \\(-40 + 10 = -30\\)\n- \\(-60 + 20 = -40\\)\n\nEverything adds up correctly.\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Net Displacement**\n\nNow that I have the final coordinates of point B, \\( B(-40, -30) \\), I need to find the straight-line distance from A to B, denoted as \\( \\overline{AB} \\).\n\n### **Checking Strategies:**\n\nI could use the Pythagorean theorem here because I have the differences in the x and y coordinates.\n\nBut before proceeding, let me make sure this is the right approach. The Pythagorean theorem applies to right triangles, and here, the movements create a right triangle with the legs being the net displacements in the x and y directions. So, it seems appropriate.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse (the distance \\( \\overline{AB} \\))\n- \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the legs corresponding to the net displacements in the x and y directions\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the differences:\n\n- **Net displacement in x-direction:**\n  \\[\n  \\Delta x = x_B - x_A = (-40) - (0) = -40\n  \\]\n  (The negative sign indicates direction, but we're squaring it, so it doesn't matter.)\n\n- **Net displacement in y-direction:**\n  \\[\n  \\Delta y = y_B - y_A = (-30) - (0) = -30\n  \\]\n  (Similarly, the negative sign is irrelevant for distance.)\n\nPlugging these values into the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{AB}^2 = (-40)^2 + (-30)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{AB}^2 = 1600 + 900 = 2500\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{AB} = \\sqrt{2500} = 50 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflecting on Step 3: Checking the Calculation**\n\nDoes the answer make sense? Let's quickly check:\n\n1. The path involved moving 40 yards south and 10 yards north, resulting in a net of 30 yards south. \n2. Then, moving 60 yards west and 20 yards east results in a net of 40 yards west.\n3. So, the triangle formed has sides of 30 yards and 40 yards.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n50^2 = 30^2 + 40^2 \\rightarrow 2500 = 900 + 1600\n\\]\n\nIt checks out! The numbers align.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Drawing the Path**\n\nJust to confirm, I might consider sketching the movements:\n\n- Start at the origin.\n- Move south to (-40, 0).\n- Then west to (-60, -40).\n- North to (-60, -30).\n- Finally, east to (-40, -30).\n\nVisually, this forms a right triangle, which reinforces the use of the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nThe **Coordinate System Approach** worked well here. By assigning coordinates and systematically applying each movement, I was able to calculate the net displacements accurately. The Pythagorean theorem provided the correct method to find the straight-line distance.\n\nInitially, I considered other strategies like vector addition and drawing the path, but sticking with the coordinate system and Pythagorean theorem proved efficient and straightforward.\n\nIt's always good to reflect and check along the way, ensuring each step makes sense and aligns with the expected outcomes. This approach led me confidently to the solution: the length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is **50 yards**.",

  "ground_truth": "Keep up with the north-south movement separately from the east-west movement.  Leigh goes 40 yards south and 10 yards north, so she ends up 30 yards south of her starting position.  She goes 60 yards west and 20 yards east for a net east-west displacement of 40 yards west.  Going 30 yards south and 40 yards west puts Leigh $\\sqrt{30^2+40^2}=\\boxed{50}$ yards away."
