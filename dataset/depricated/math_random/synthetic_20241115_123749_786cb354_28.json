    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process step-by-step, brainstorming different strategies, checking if they're correct, and adjusting as needed\u2014just like how I would naturally tackle it as a human.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\( f(x + y) = f(x) f(y) \\), it reminds me of properties related to exponential functions. I recall that functions satisfying similar functional equations often have connections to exponentials or could be constant functions. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Maybe exploring different strategies will help clarify things.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Substituting Specific Values:** Try plugging in particular values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to see what happens.\n2. **Analyzing \\( f(0) \\):** Since the problem asks about \\( f(0) \\), perhaps focusing on that could lead somewhere.\n3. **Exploring Exponential Functions:** Given the form of the equation, maybe \\( f(x) \\) is an exponential function.\n4. **Considering Constant Solutions:** Could \\( f(x) \\) be a constant function?\n\nI think starting with substituting specific values might give me some initial insights. If that doesn't lead anywhere, I'll consider other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Substituting \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\)**\n\nLet's plug in \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\nf(0 + 0) = f(0) f(0) \\implies f(0) = f(0) f(0) \\implies f(0) = [f(0)]^2\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nOkay, so \\( f(0) \\) must satisfy the equation \\( f(0) = [f(0)]^2 \\). This is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( f(0) \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nI remember that quadratic equations like this can often lead to multiple solutions, so let's see what values satisfy it.\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n\\[\nf(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad f(0) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nBoth \\( f(0) = 0 \\) and \\( f(0) = 1 \\) are solutions to the equation \\( f(0) = [f(0)]^2 \\). That's interesting\u2014there might be two possible cases for \\( f(0) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the Case \\( f(0) = 0 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf \\( f(0) = 0 \\), let's see what that implies for the function \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Substituting \\( y = 0 \\) in the Original Equation:**\n\n\\[\nf(x + 0) = f(x) f(0) \\implies f(x) = f(x) \\cdot 0 \\implies f(x) = 0 \\quad \\forall x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014if \\( f(0) = 0 \\), then \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\). That means \\( f(x) \\) is the zero function. Is this a valid solution?\n\n**Check:**\n\nThe zero function satisfies the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x + y) = 0 = 0 \\cdot 0 = f(x) f(y)\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSo, \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) is indeed a solution when \\( f(0) = 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring the Case \\( f(0) = 1 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, let's consider the case where \\( f(0) = 1 \\).\n\n**Substituting \\( y = 0 \\) in the Original Equation:**\n\n\\[\nf(x + 0) = f(x) f(0) \\implies f(x) = f(x) \\cdot 1 \\implies f(x) = f(x)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis doesn't impose any new conditions\u2014it's always true. So, \\( f(0) = 1 \\) doesn't contradict anything.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nMaybe \\( f(x) \\) could be an exponential function in this case. Let's explore that possibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Exponential Functions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven that the functional equation resembles the property of exponential functions, let's assume \\( f(x) = a^x \\) for some \\( a \\).\n\n**Substituting into the Original Equation:**\n\n\\[\nf(x + y) = a^{x+y} = a^x a^y = f(x) f(y)\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis works perfectly for any real \\( a \\). However, we need to ensure that \\( f(0) = 1 \\), which gives us:\n\n\\[\nf(0) = a^0 = 1 \\implies a = 1\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSo, the only exponential function that satisfies \\( f(0) = 1 \\) is \\( f(x) = 1^x = 1 \\) for all \\( x \\). This aligns with our earlier finding.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWe have two cases:\n\n1. **\\( f(0) = 0 \\):** This leads to \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), which satisfies the original equation.\n2. **\\( f(0) = 1 \\):** This corresponds to \\( f(x) = 1 \\) for all \\( x \\), which also satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Check:**\n\nBoth \\( f(x) = 0 \\) and \\( f(x) = 1 \\) are consistent with the functional equation \\( f(x + y) = f(x) f(y) \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nAre there any other possible functions that could satisfy the equation besides these two? Given the structure of the equation, it seems likely that only constant functions or exponential-like functions (with \\( a = 1 \\)) work. We've covered the constant cases, so that might be it.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe possible values of \\( f(0) \\) are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0, 1}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy starting with specific substitutions, we identified that \\( f(0) \\) must satisfy \\( f(0) = [f(0)]^2 \\), leading us to \\( f(0) = 0 \\) or \\( f(0) = 1 \\).\n\nExploring these cases, we found that:\n\n- **\\( f(0) = 0 \\):** Implies \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), which is a valid solution.\n- **\\( f(0) = 1 \\):** Allows for \\( f(x) = 1 \\) for all \\( x \\), which is also a valid solution.\n\nConsidering other potential functions, such as exponential functions, reinforced that these are the only solutions.",
