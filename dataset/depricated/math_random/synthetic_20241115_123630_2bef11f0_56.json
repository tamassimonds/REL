It could get cumbersome.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Using the Binomial Theorem:** This seems most straightforward for finding a specific term in the expansion.\n- **Manual Expansion:** Possibly viable for smaller exponents, but 6 might be too big to do this efficiently without making mistakes.\n- **Combinatorial Approach:** Could apply combinatorics to select the powers needed, but I feel it might overlap with the Binomial Theorem approach.\n\nI think starting with the **Binomial Theorem** is the best path, but I\u2019ll keep an eye out for any issues and adjust if necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Recall the Binomial Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me recall what the Binomial Theorem states. I remember it gives a formula for expanding \\( (a + b)^n \\) as a sum of terms involving binomial coefficients.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\n**Applying to Our Problem:**\n\n- Here, \\( a = x \\), \\( b = y \\), and \\( n = 6 \\).\n- So, the expansion would be:\n  \\[\n  (x + y)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} x^{6-k} y^k\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks like the right approach. Each term in the expansion corresponds to different values of \\( k \\), where \\( k \\) ranges from 0 to 6. The term \\( x^2y^4 \\) should align with \\( k = 4 \\) since the exponent of \\( y \\) is 4.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Correct Term**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\( x^2y^4 \\), I need to determine which term in the expansion corresponds to \\( k = 4 \\) (since \\( y \\) is raised to the 4th power).\n\n**Formula Setup:**\n\nFrom the Binomial Theorem:\n\\[\n\\text{Term with } k = 4: \\binom{6}{4} x^{6-4} y^4 = \\binom{6}{4} x^2 y^4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me double-check this. If \\( k = 4 \\), then \\( y^4 \\) is correct, and \\( x^{6-4} = x^2 \\) also matches what we need. So this seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Binomial Coefficient**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to compute \\( \\binom{6}{4} \\). Let me recall how to calculate binomial coefficients.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4! \\times 2!}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- \\( 6! = 720 \\)\n- \\( 4! = 24 \\)\n- \\( 2! = 2 \\)\n\nNow,\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{720}{24 \\times 2} = \\frac{720}{48} = 15\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me check the math quickly:\n- \\( 24 \\times 2 = 48 \\)\n- \\( 720 \u00f7 48 = 15 \\)\n\nThis looks correct. So, the coefficient is 15.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s ensure that using \\( k = 4 \\) aligns perfectly with the term \\( x^2y^4 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Exponents Match:** \n  - \\( y^4 \\) corresponds to \\( k = 4 \\).\n  - \\( x^2 \\) is naturally what\u2019s left since the total exponent is 6.\n  \n- **Binomial Theorem Application:**\n  - The Binomial Theorem was applied correctly.\n  - The coefficient calculation is accurate.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything seems to line up. The approach makes sense, and the calculations check out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Explore an Alternative Method (Optional)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEven though the Binomial Theorem works well here, let\u2019s consider if there\u2019s another way to confirm the result.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\nPerhaps I could list out a few terms in the expansion to see if they align. \n\n**Example Terms:**\n\n1. \\( k = 0: \\binom{6}{0} x^6 y^0 = 1 x^6 \\)\n2. \\( k = 1: \\binom{6}{1} x^5 y^1 = 6 x^5 y \\)\n3. \\( k = 2: \\binom{6}{2} x^4 y^2 = 15 x^4 y^2 \\)\n4. \\( k = 3: \\binom{6}{3} x^3 y^3 = 20 x^3 y^3 \\)\n5. \\( k = 4: \\binom{6}{4} x^2 y^4 = 15 x^2 y^4 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nListing these out confirms that the coefficient of \\( x^2y^4 \\) is indeed 15. This serves as a good cross-check.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nWhile this method validates the result, it's less efficient than using the Binomial Theorem directly, especially for larger exponents.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s quickly review all steps to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Binomial Theorem Application:** Correctly identified the term using \\( k = 4 \\).\n2. **Coefficient Calculation:** \\( \\binom{6}{4} = 15 \\) computed accurately.\n3. **Alternative Method Validation:** Listing terms matched the expected result.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The approaches align, and the coefficient is consistent across different methods.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully exploring different strategies, applying the Binomial Theorem, and verifying with alternative methods, I confidently conclude that the **coefficient of the \\( x^2y^4 \\) term in the expansion of \\( (x + y)^6 \\) is **15**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Hesitations:** At first, I wasn\u2019t sure if directly applying the Binomial Theorem was the best approach, but reflecting on its suitability made me proceed confidently.\n- **Exploring Alternatives:** Considering listing terms provided additional validation, though it was less efficient.\n- **Importance of Checking:** Regular checks ensured the accuracy of each step, preventing potential mistakes.\n- **Outcome Satisfaction:** The multiple methods leading to the same result reinforce the correctness of the solution.\n\nBy thinking through each step, reflecting often, and verifying calculations, the problem was approached methodically, leading to a reliable solution.",
