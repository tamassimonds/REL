    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process, brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach makes sense, and check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. It\u2019s important to think out loud, just like I would if I were solving this on paper, including any confusion or insights along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} (r + s + t) = 12\n\\]\n\nI think, **\u201cThis looks like a linear equation involving the sum of three variables multiplied by a fraction.\u201d** Immediately, I'm reminded of equations where you need to isolate a variable or simplify to find averages. **But wait, is the average directly related here?** Let me brainstorm how to proceed.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Isolate \\( r + s + t \\):** \n   - My initial thought is to get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides by its reciprocal.\n   \n2. **Relate to Averages:**\n   - I recall that the average of numbers is the sum divided by the number of terms. Maybe I can link this equation directly to the average.\n\n3. **Check for Simplification:**\n   - Look if there\u2019s a way to simplify the equation immediately or if more steps are needed.\n\n4. **Numerical Check:**\n   - Consider plugging in sample values to see if they make sense, but since this is an algebraic equation, that might not be the best approach right now.\n\n### **Step 1: Isolating \\( r + s + t \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s start with my first idea\u2014getting \\( r + s + t \\) by itself.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} (r + s + t) = 12\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** \nTo remove the fraction, I should multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), which is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(r + s + t) = 12 \\times \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(r + s + t) = 9\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, so the sum of \\( r \\), \\( s \\), and \\( t \\) is 9. That seems logical. But **does this directly give me the average?** No, but I can see the average is related since it's the sum divided by the number of variables.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Average**\n\nNow that I know \\( r + s + t = 9 \\), I can find the average.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe average is the sum divided by the number of terms. Here, there are three variables: \\( r \\), \\( s \\), and \\( t \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{r + s + t}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, the average of \\( r \\), \\( s \\), and \\( t \\) is 3. **Does this make sense?** Let me quickly check: if the sum is 9 and there are three variables, dividing by 3 should give an average of 3. **Looks correct.**\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\nBefore finalizing, I want to ensure my method is correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Did multiplying by \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) make sense?** Yes, it properly eliminated the fraction.\n- **Is dividing the sum by 3 the correct way to find the average?** Absolutely, since there are three variables.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nEverything checks out. But it\u2019s always good to think if there\u2019s a more straightforward way. **Wait, is there another method?**\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Relating Directly to Averages**\n\nLet\u2019s see if there's a direct way to approach it.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI notice that the original equation involves \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) times the sum. **Could I relate this directly to the average?**\n\n**Calculation:**\nSince the average is the sum divided by the number of terms, and here the sum is multiplied by \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) to equal 12, I can set up:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} \\times \\text{Average} = 12\n\\]\n\n**Solving for Average:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = 12 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 9\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, this seems to lead me back to the same result. **So, using different approaches still confirms the average is 3.** This reassures me that the method is correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check**\n\nBefore concluding, let\u2019s ensure everything aligns:\n\n- **Sum of \\( r \\), \\( s \\), and \\( t \\):** Correctly calculated as 9.\n- **Average calculation:** Divided the sum by 3, yielding 3.\n- **Multiple strategies leading to the same result:** Confirmed consistency across approaches.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nEverything aligns perfectly. **I\u2019m confident that the average is indeed 3.**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe average of \\( r \\), \\( s \\), and \\( t \\) is **3**.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, I initially isolated the sum of the variables by removing the fraction. Then, I calculated the average by dividing this sum by the number of variables. Verifying through multiple approaches ensured the accuracy of the result. Checking and reflecting at each step helped catch any potential mistakes early, leading to a confident and correct answer.",
