    "working_out": "Absolutely, let\u2019s tackle this problem just like I would if I were working through it on paper. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work as I proceed. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Given Equations:** \\( x + y = 10 \\) and \\( 2x + y = 13 \\)\n- **Goal:** Evaluate \\( x^2 - y^2 \\)\n\nHmm, this reminds me of systems of linear equations. I\u2019ve dealt with those before, where you solve for one variable in terms of another or use elimination or substitution methods.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** Solve one equation for a variable and substitute into the other.\n2. **Elimination Method:** Subtract one equation from the other to eliminate a variable.\n3. **Using Algebraic Identities:** Since the goal is \\( x^2 - y^2 \\), maybe I can use the identity \\( x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) \\). This looks promising because if I can find \\( x - y \\), I already have \\( x + y = 10 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** The third idea seems most straightforward since it directly connects to \\( x^2 - y^2 \\). But let me also consider the first two methods to ensure I\u2019m not missing anything.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Substitution Method**\n\n**Step 1:** Let\u2019s try solving for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) using the first equation.\n\n\\[\nx + y = 10 \\implies y = 10 - x\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Okay, now that I have \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), I can substitute this into the second equation to find \\( x \\).\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute \\( y = 10 - x \\) into \\( 2x + y = 13 \\).\n\n\\[\n2x + (10 - x) = 13\n\\]\n\\[\n2x + 10 - x = 13\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 10 = 13\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? \\( x = 3 \\), so according to the first equation, \\( y = 10 - 3 = 7 \\). Let\u2019s quickly verify with the second equation:\n\n\\[\n2(3) + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Now I have \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = 7 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** This seems correct. But before finalizing, let's see if using the identity method simplifies things or provides a better check.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Elimination Method**\n\n**Step 4:** Let\u2019s subtract the first equation from the second to see if that gives us a different route.\n\n\\[\n(2x + y) - (x + y) = 13 - 10\n\\]\n\\[\n2x + y - x - y = 3\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Again, we arrive at \\( x = 3 \\). Then, \\( y = 10 - 3 = 7 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** Both methods agree, which is a good sign. It reassures me that the solution is likely correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Approach Using Algebraic Identity**\n\n**Step 5:** Let\u2019s use the identity \\( x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) \\).\n\nWe already know \\( x + y = 10 \\). Now, we need to find \\( x - y \\).\n\n**Step 6:** Calculate \\( x - y \\).\n\n\\[\nx - y = 3 - 7 = -4\n\\]\n\n**Step 7:** Now, use the identity to find \\( x^2 - y^2 \\).\n\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) = 10 \\times (-4) = -40\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Let me think about this. Does \\( x^2 - y^2 = -40 \\) make sense given \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = 7 \\)?\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 3^2 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\ny^2 = 7^2 = 49\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = 9 - 49 = -40 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Using the identity method didn\u2019t change the outcome but provided a direct path to the solution. It\u2019s always good to have multiple approaches confirming the same result.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming and exploring different strategies, both the substitution method and the elimination method led me to \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = 7 \\). Using the algebraic identity \\( x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) \\) confirmed that \\( x^2 - y^2 = -40 \\).\n\nThroughout the process, I checked each step to ensure correctness and reflected on whether each method was appropriate. This approach helped maintain accuracy and provided confidence in the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\( x^2 - y^2 = -40 \\)\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need any further clarification or if there's another problem you'd like to tackle!",

  "ground_truth": "Subtracting the first given equation from the second equation, we have $2x+y-(x+y)=13-10 \\Rightarrow x=3$. Plugging the value of $x$ into the first given equation to solve for $y$, we have $y=10-x=7$. Thus, $x^2-y^2=3^2-7^2=\\boxed{-40}$."
