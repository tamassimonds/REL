I'll walk through brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on whether each approach is working, checking work along the way, and being open to changing strategies if something doesn't seem right. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, \\(\\sec 120^\\circ\\), it reminds me of trigonometric identities and the unit circle. Here's what comes to mind:\n\n1. **Unit Circle Approach:** I recall that the unit circle is a fundamental tool in trigonometry for understanding angles and their corresponding coordinates.\n   \n2. **Trigonometric Identities:** Maybe I can use identities involving cosine and secant since secant is the reciprocal of cosine.\n\n3. **Reference Angles:** I remember that finding the reference angle could help since it relates the given angle to a common angle on the unit circle.\n\n4. **Angle Sum or Difference Formulas:** Perhaps breaking down \\(120^\\circ\\) into smaller angles that I know well could be useful.\n\nAt this stage, I think the **Unit Circle Approach** makes the most sense because \\(120^\\circ\\) is an angle that lies in the second quadrant, and the unit circle gives direct access to its cosine value, which is crucial since \\(\\sec\\) is the reciprocal of cosine.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Unit Circle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate plane. Each angle corresponds to a point on the circle, and the x-coordinates of these points represent the cosine values, while the y-coordinates represent the sine values.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- **Quadrants:** I recall that the unit circle is divided into four quadrants:\n  - **First Quadrant (0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0):** Both x (cosine) and y (sine) are positive.\n  - **Second Quadrant (90\u00b0 to 180\u00b0):** Cosine is negative, sine is positive.\n  - **Third Quadrant (180\u00b0 to 270\u00b0):** Both cosine and sine are negative.\n  - **Fourth Quadrant (270\u00b0 to 360\u00b0):** Cosine is positive, sine is negative.\n\nSince \\(120^\\circ\\) is in the **Second Quadrant**, I know that the cosine value (and thus secant) will be negative.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense because the secant function, being the reciprocal of cosine, will inherit the sign of the cosine value from the unit circle.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI\u2019m going to **proceed with using the unit circle** to find \\(\\sec 120^\\circ\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Locating \\(120^\\circ\\) on the Unit Circle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to find the coordinates of the point on the unit circle that corresponds to \\(120^\\circ\\). This will give me the cosine and sine values directly.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- **Reference Angle:** The reference angle for \\(120^\\circ\\) is \\(180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ\\). This means \\(120^\\circ\\) has the same sine value as \\(60^\\circ\\) but a negative cosine value because it's in the second quadrant.\n\n- **Coordinates of \\(60^\\circ\\):** On the unit circle, the point corresponding to \\(60^\\circ\\) is:\n  \\[\n  (\\cos 60^\\circ, \\sin 60^\\circ) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n- **Adjusting for the Second Quadrant:** Since \\(120^\\circ\\) is in the second quadrant:\n  \\[\n  \\sec 120^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\cos 120^\\circ}\n  \\]\n  \\(\\cos 120^\\circ\\) will be negative.\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, let me double-check this. I remember that in the second quadrant, the x-coordinate (cosine) should be negative. The sine (y-coordinate) remains positive.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So,\n\n\\[\n\\cos 120^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\sec 120^\\circ = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2}} = -2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this align with the unit circle properties? Yes, because in the second quadrant, cosine values are negative, and thus secant, being the reciprocal, is negative.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThis approach **seems correct**. Secant \\(120^\\circ\\) is indeed **\\(-2\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with Trigonometric Identities**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's check this result using a trigonometric identity involving secant.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- **Identity Involving Cosine and Secant:**\n  \\[\n  \\sec \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\cos \\theta}\n  \\]\n  Since we've already determined \\(\\cos 120^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), substituting this in:\n  \\[\n  \\sec 120^\\circ = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2}} = -2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Alternative Approach Using Angle Sum Formula:**\n  Another way to verify is to express \\(120^\\circ\\) as \\(90^\\circ + 30^\\circ\\) and use the cosine of sum formula:\n  \\[\n  \\cos(90^\\circ + 30^\\circ) = \\cos 90^\\circ \\cos 30^\\circ - \\sin 90^\\circ \\sin 30^\\circ\n  \\]\n  Substituting known values:\n  \\[\n  \\cos 90^\\circ = 0, \\quad \\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\quad \\sin 90^\\circ = 1, \\quad \\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n  So,\n  \\[\n  \\cos 120^\\circ = 0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n  This aligns with our earlier finding.\n\n**Check:**\n\nBoth methods confirm that \\(\\cos 120^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), and therefore, \\(\\sec 120^\\circ = -2\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSince both approaches yield the same result, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\sec 120^\\circ = -2\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Using the unit circle provided a clear and direct way to find \\(\\sec 120^\\circ\\). It aligned with the properties of trigonometric functions in different quadrants.\n\n- **Verification Importance:** Checking the result with trigonometric identities ensured that the solution was accurate and consistent across different methods.\n\n- **Mistakes and Adjustments:** Initially contemplating alternative strategies like angle sum formulas reinforced the correctness of the unit circle approach.\n\n- **Confidence in the Solution:** Multiple verification steps confirm that \\(\\sec 120^\\circ = -2\\) is indeed the correct answer.\n\n---\n\nBy following this step-by-step approach\u2014brainstorming, exploring multiple strategies, reflecting and checking along the way\u2014I was able to confidently determine that \\(\\sec 120^\\circ = -2\\). This method not only provided the correct answer but also ensured a deep understanding of the underlying trigonometric principles.",
