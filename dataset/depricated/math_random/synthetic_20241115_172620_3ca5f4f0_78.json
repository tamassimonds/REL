    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, thinking through it as naturally as possible. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their validity, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach if anything feels off.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, several things jump out at me:\n\n1. **Trigonometric Identity Involvement:** The expressions **\\(\\cos(2A - B)\\)** and **\\(\\sin(A + B)\\)** hint at using trigonometric identities or formulas related to angles in a triangle.\n   \n2. **Given Side Length \\(AB = 4\\):** Knowing one side length could be helpful. Maybe I can relate it to the other sides using the Law of Cosines or Sines.\n\n3. **Objective to Find \\(BC\\):** This makes me think about side lengths and possibly applying the Law of Sines or different trigonometric properties to find \\(BC\\).\n\nBut honestly, at this moment, I'm not entirely sure how to connect the given equation with the side lengths directly. It feels a bit abstract.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nReflecting on the problem, here are a few strategies that come to mind:\n\n1. **Trigonometric Identities:** Use trigonometric identities to simplify the given equation. Maybe this can help relate angles \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) more directly.\n\n2. **Law of Sines or Cosines:** With one side known (\\(AB = 4\\)), perhaps I can apply these laws once the angles are determined.\n\n3. **Express \\(BC\\) in Terms of Angles:** If I can express \\(BC\\) using known trigonometric relationships and then solve for the angles, that might work.\n\n4. **Check for Special Angles:** Sometimes problems involve special angle values (like 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, etc.), so it might be worth checking if that applies here.\n\nLet me start with the **Trigonometric Identities** approach because it directly involves the given equation. If that doesn't lead anywhere, I'll pivot to the Law of Sines or Cosines.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplifying the Given Equation**\n\nThe given equation is:\n\\[\n\\cos(2A - B) + \\sin(A + B) = 2\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWait a minute. The maximum value for \\(\\cos\\) and \\(\\sin\\) is 1. So, the only way their sum can equal 2 is if both \\(\\cos(2A - B)\\) and \\(\\sin(A + B)\\) are individually 1. This is a strong clue.\n\n**Realization:**  \nThis means:\n\\[\n\\cos(2A - B) = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sin(A + B) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis implies:\n\\[\n2A - B = 0 \\quad \\text{(since \\(\\cos(0) = 1\\))}  \n\\]\n\\[\nA + B = 90^\\circ \\quad \\text{(since \\(\\sin(90^\\circ) = 1\\))}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, now I have two important relationships between the angles. This seems like a good starting point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for Angle \\(B\\) in Terms of \\(A\\)**\n\nFrom the equations:\n\\[\n2A - B = 0 \\implies B = 2A\n\\]\n\\[\nA + B = 90^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Substituting \\(B = 2A\\) into \\(A + B = 90^\\circ\\):**\n\\[\nA + 2A = 90^\\circ \\implies 3A = 90^\\circ \\implies A = 30^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWait, so angle \\(A\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\)? That seems straightforward. Let me double-check the math.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nSolving \\(3A = 90^\\circ\\) gives \\(A = 30^\\circ\\), which makes \\(B = 60^\\circ\\). That adds up.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining Angles \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)**\n\nSo far:\n\\[\nA = 30^\\circ  \nB = 60^\\circ  \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks consistent. Now I need to find angle \\(C\\).\n\n**Calculating Angle \\(C\\):**\n\\[\nC = 180^\\circ - A - B = 180^\\circ - 30^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 90^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWait, angle \\(C\\) is \\(90^\\circ\\)? That means triangle \\(ABC\\) is a right triangle. This is important because it opens up different strategies for finding \\(BC\\).\n\n**Realization:**  \nSince \\(C = 90^\\circ\\), I can use the **Pythagorean Theorem** or perhaps relate the sides through trigonometric ratios specific to right triangles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Deciding on the Next Step**\n\nNow I have:\n- \\(A = 30^\\circ\\)\n- \\(B = 60^\\circ\\)\n- \\(C = 90^\\circ\\)\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n1. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** Since it's a right triangle, relate the sides directly.\n2. **Law of Sines:** Although in a right triangle, the ratios might simplify.\n3. **Trigonometric Ratios:** Use sine, cosine, or tangent functions for the given angles.\n\nGiven that angle \\(C\\) is \\(90^\\circ\\) and I have \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the **Pythagorean Theorem** seems like the most straightforward approach since I'm dealing with a right triangle.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nIn a right triangle:\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\\]\n\n**Assigning Sides:**\n- \\(AB = 4\\) (Given)\n- Let\u2019s denote:\n  - \\(AB = c = 4\\) (Hypotenuse)\n  - \\(BC = a\\)\n  - \\(AC = b\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWait, but I don't have enough information yet. I need to find either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) to use the Pythagorean theorem directly. Since \\(BC\\) is what I need to find, I'll look for another method that's more direct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Alternative Approach - Using Law of Sines**\n\nGiven that I have angles and one side, the **Law of Sines** might be applicable here:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}\n\\]\n\n**Assigning Sides:**\n- \\(AB = c = 4\\)\n- \\(BC = a\\)\n- \\(AC = b\\)\n\n**Applying Law of Sines:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{4}{\\sin 90^\\circ}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(\\sin 30^\\circ\\):**\n\\[\n\\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(a\\):**\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{4}{1} \\implies a = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, that doesn't make sense. Earlier, I assigned \\(BC = a\\), but now I'm getting \\(a = 2\\). Let me re-examine the sides.\n\n**Reassigning Sides:**\nWhen applying Law of Sines, I might have misassigned. Let's correct that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Correcting Side Assignments**\n\n**Hypothesis:**  \nPerhaps I misassigned \\(AB\\) as the hypotenuse. Let me re-think which sides correspond to which angles.\n\n**Reassigning:**\n- Given \\(AB = 4\\), but since \\(C = 90^\\circ\\), \\(AB\\) should be the side opposite angle \\(C\\), thus the hypotenuse.\n\n**Correct Assignments:**\n- \\(AB = c = 4\\) (Hypotenuse)\n- \\(BC = a\\)\n- \\(AC = b\\)\n\n**Applying Law of Sines Again:**\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} \\implies \\frac{a}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{4}{1} \\implies a = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWait, that means \\(BC = 2\\)? That seems small compared to \\(AB = 4\\). Let me double-check.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIf \\(BC = 2\\) and \\(AC = b\\), and with \\(A = 30^\\circ\\) and \\(B = 60^\\circ\\), the ratios seem consistent with a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\n**Realization:**  \nAh, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the relationships are:\n- The side opposite the 30\u00b0 angle is half the hypotenuse.\n- The side opposite the 60\u00b0 angle is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) times the hypotenuse.\n\n**Applying 30-60-90 Ratios:**\n- \\(AB = 4\\) (hypotenuse)\n- Side opposite 30\u00b0 (which is \\(BC\\)) should be:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n  \\]\n- Side opposite 60\u00b0 (which is \\(AC\\)) should be:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2\\sqrt{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSo, \\(BC = 2\\) makes sense given the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Final Verification**\n\n**Check:**\n- Angle \\(A = 30^\\circ\\), \\(B = 60^\\circ\\), \\(C = 90^\\circ\\): Consistent with a 30-60-90 triangle.\n- \\(AB = 4\\): Hypotenuse.\n- \\(BC = 2\\): Side opposite 30\u00b0; half the hypotenuse, which aligns with the triangle properties.\n- \\(AC = 2\\sqrt{3}\\): Side opposite 60\u00b0; \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) times the hypotenuse, also aligns.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The side lengths correspond correctly to the angles based on the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, confirming angle relationships, and applying trigonometric properties specific to right triangles, I've determined that side \\(BC\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Thought Process**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Started by considering trigonometric identities and side relations.\n  \n- **Identity Simplification:** Realized that the sum equaled 2 only if both terms were 1, leading to specific angle relationships.\n\n- **Angle Calculations:** Determined that \\(A = 30^\\circ\\), \\(B = 60^\\circ\\), and \\(C = 90^\\circ\\), identifying it as a right triangle.\n\n- **Side Assignments:** Initially confused about side assignments but corrected using 30-60-90 triangle properties.\n\n- **Applying Ratios:** Used the Law of Sines and triangle properties to find \\(BC = 2\\).\n\n- **Verification:** Checked that side lengths align with angle properties, confirming the solution's correctness.\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected frequently, checked for consistency, and adjusted my approach as needed, ensuring a reliable and accurate solution.",
