    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see how I can approach it. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, exploring each one, making sure to reflect and check my work along the way. I'll think out loud, showing all my thought processes\u2014both the correct steps and any mistakes I encounter. Let's make it as human-like as possible!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I notice a few key details:\n\n1. **Two Concentric Circles:** This means one circle is inside the other, sharing the same center.\n2. **Radius Relationship:** The radius of the outer circle is **twice** that of the inner circle.\n3. **Width of the Gray Region:** The gray region's **width is 2 feet**.\n4. **Area in Terms of \\(\\pi\\):** I need to express my final answer in terms of \\(\\pi\\).\n\nHmm, so the width of the gray region is the difference between the radii of the two circles. That gives me an initial clue about how to relate the widths to the areas. But let me think this through more thoroughly to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate Individual Areas:**\n   - Find the area of both circles separately and then subtract the area of the inner circle from the outer circle.\n\n2. **Use the Width to Find Radii:**\n   - Since the width of the gray region is given, I can use this to find the radii of both circles.\n\n3. **Leverage the Radius Relationship:**\n   - The outer circle's radius is twice the inner circle's radius, so that relationship can simplify calculations.\n\nWait, the width of the gray region is given as 2 feet, which is the difference between the outer and inner radii. This is a crucial piece of information because it directly relates to finding the areas.\n\nBut before I proceed, let me double-check if I fully understand the question. The gray region is the area between the two circles, right? And the width is the distance from the inner circle's edge to the outer circle's edge? Okay, that makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Relationship Between Width and Radii**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe width of the gray region is the difference between the radii of the outer and inner circles. Mathematically, I can express this as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Width} = r_{\\text{outer}} - r_{\\text{inner}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the width is 2 feet, I can write:\n\n\\[\nr_{\\text{outer}} - r_{\\text{inner}} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\nNow, I know that the radius of the outer circle is twice that of the inner circle:\n\n\\[\nr_{\\text{outer}} = 2 \\times r_{\\text{inner}}\n\\]\n\nMaybe I can substitute this into the width equation to find the inner radius. Let's try that.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubstituting \\( r_{\\text{outer}} = 2 \\times r_{\\text{inner}} \\) into the width equation:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times r_{\\text{inner}} - r_{\\text{inner}} = 2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nr_{\\text{inner}} = 2 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nWait, so the inner radius is 2 feet? Let me double-check. If the outer radius is twice the inner radius, and the inner radius is 2 feet, then the outer radius should be:\n\n\\[\nr_{\\text{outer}} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThat seems consistent because if the inner radius is 2 feet, the outer radius being 4 feet would make the width of the gray region 2 feet (4 - 2 = 2). So, this looks correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach worked out well. By leveraging the relationship between the radii and the given width, I was able to find the radii of both circles without any confusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Area of Each Circle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the radii, I can calculate the area of both circles using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nI'll find the area of the outer circle and the inner circle separately and then subtract the inner circle's area from the outer circle's area to get the area of the gray region.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Outer Circle Area:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{outer}} = \\pi (r_{\\text{outer}})^2 = \\pi (4)^2 = 16\\pi \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\n2. **Inner Circle Area:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{inner}} = \\pi (r_{\\text{inner}})^2 = \\pi (2)^2 = 4\\pi \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\n3. **Gray Region Area:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{gray}} = \\text{Area}_{\\text{outer}} - \\text{Area}_{\\text{inner}} = 16\\pi - 4\\pi = 12\\pi \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe calculation seems straightforward. By subtracting the area of the inner circle from the outer circle, I arrived at the area of the gray region. Let me quickly check if the radii and areas make sense numerically.\n\n- The outer radius is 4 feet, and the inner radius is 2 feet, which aligns with the given width of 2 feet.\n- The areas calculated using \\(\\pi r^2\\) also seem correct.\n\nEverything checks out. But just to be sure, I'll double-check the area formula and the substitution steps to confirm there were no miscalculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Double-Checking the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait a moment\u2014let me ensure that the width of the gray region is indeed the difference between the outer and inner radii. The problem states the width is 2 feet, which matches my earlier calculations (4 - 2 = 2).\n\nAlso, the relationship between the radii is correctly applied. The outer radius being twice the inner radius is consistent with both the width and the area calculations.\n\n**Exploring Alternative Strategies:**\n\nI could have also approached this by using the area difference directly related to the width, but that seemed more complex than calculating individual areas.\n\nGiven that the step-by-step method worked well, I'll stick with it.\n\n**Calculation Check:**\n\n- **Width Calculation:** \\( r_{\\text{outer}} - r_{\\text{inner}} = 4 - 2 = 2 \\) feet \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Area Calculation:** \\( 16\\pi - 4\\pi = 12\\pi \\) square feet \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything aligns perfectly. There's no inconsistency or error in the approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI'm satisfied with the solution. By methodically finding the radii and then calculating the areas, I was able to determine the area of the gray region as \\( 12\\pi \\) square feet.\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure to:\n\n- **Understand the Relationships:** Recognizing how the width relates to the radii was crucial.\n- **Apply Formulas Correctly:** Using \\( \\pi r^2 \\) for the area calculations ensured accuracy.\n- **Double-Check Calculations:** Verifying each step helped catch any potential mistakes early.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\pi} \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem step by step, exploring different strategies, and continually checking my work, I've arrived at the correct solution. This method ensures a thorough understanding and prevents oversights, leading to a reliable and accurate answer.",
