So here, \\( n \\) should leave the same remainder as \\( 7882 \\) when divided by \\( 5 \\).\n  \n- **Possible Values of \\( n \\):** The possible integers are \\( 4, 5, 6, 7, \\) and \\( 8 \\). That's a manageable set to work with.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:**\n  - **Direct Remainder Calculation:** Maybe I can find \\( 7882 \\mod 5 \\) directly and see which \\( n \\) in the range matches.\n  - **Testing Each Value:** Alternatively, I could test each \\( n \\) in the range to see if it satisfies the congruence.\n  - **Properties of Modulo 5:** I recall that numbers that differ by multiples of \\( 5 \\) have the same remainder. Perhaps this can help narrow down the options.\n\nLet me start with the **Direct Remainder Calculation** approach.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Calculate \\( 7882 \\mod 5 \\)**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- I need to find the remainder when \\( 7882 \\) is divided by \\( 5 \\).\n- I know that numbers ending in \\( 0 \\) or \\( 5 \\) are multiples of \\( 5 \\), so their remainder is \\( 0 \\).\n- Let's see where \\( 7882 \\) falls.\n\nCalculation:\n\n\\[\n7882 \\div 5 = 1576 \\quad (\\text{since } 1576 \\times 5 = 7880)\n\\]\n\\[\n7882 - 7880 = 2\n\\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- Wait, \\( 7882 \\) leaves a remainder of \\( 2 \\) when divided by \\( 5 \\).\n- So, \\( 7882 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Does \\( 2 \\) make sense as a remainder? Yes, it's less than \\( 5 \\), so it's valid.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify \\( n \\) in the Range \\( 4 \\leq n \\leq 8 \\) that \\( \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\)**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- I now need to find which integer between \\( 4 \\) and \\( 8 \\) leaves a remainder of \\( 2 \\) when divided by \\( 5 \\).\n- This is essentially checking each number in the range against the congruence.\n\nPossible Values:\n\n- \\( 4 \\mod 5 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 5 \\mod 5 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 6 \\mod 5 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 7 \\mod 5 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 8 \\mod 5 = 3 \\)\n\nReflection:\n\n- Checking each value, only \\( 7 \\) leaves a remainder of \\( 2 \\) when divided by \\( 5 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- \\( 7 \\div 5 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 2 \\). So, \\( 7 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\). This matches our requirement.\n\n---\n\n**Alternative Approach: Testing Each Value**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- To ensure correctness, let's verify by testing each number in the range individually.\n\nTesting:\n\n1. **For \\( n = 4 \\):**\n   \\[\n   4 \\mod 5 = 4 \\quad (\\text{Not } 2)\n   \\]\n   \n2. **For \\( n = 5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   5 \\mod 5 = 0 \\quad (\\text{Not } 2)\n   \\]\n   \n3. **For \\( n = 6 \\):**\n   \\[\n   6 \\mod 5 = 1 \\quad (\\text{Not } 2)\n   \\]\n   \n4. **For \\( n = 7 \\):**\n   \\[\n   7 \\mod 5 = 2 \\quad (\\text{This is correct})\n   \\]\n   \n5. **For \\( n = 8 \\):**\n   \\[\n   8 \\mod 5 = 3 \\quad (\\text{Not } 2)\n   \\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- This confirms our earlier result. Only \\( n = 7 \\) satisfies the congruence.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- All other values do not leave a remainder of \\( 2 \\) when divided by \\( 5 \\). So, \\( n = 7 \\) is indeed the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Final Verification**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- Before finalizing, let's double-check everything to ensure there's no mistake.\n\nVerification:\n\n- **Remainder Calculation:** \\( 7882 \\mod 5 = 2 \\). Correct.\n- **Range Testing:** Only \\( n = 7 \\) satisfies \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\). Correct.\n- **Alternative Approach:** Testing each value individually echoed the same result. Correct.\n\nReflection:\n\n- Everything aligns perfectly. The approach was consistent, and multiple strategies led to the same conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying through multiple methods, the integer \\( n \\) that satisfies \\( n \\equiv 7882 \\pmod{5} \\) within the range \\( 4 \\leq n \\leq 8 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed step-by-step process, with brainstorming and reflections, helps in understanding how to approach and solve such problems effectively!",
