    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, exploring different strategies and reflecting along the way to ensure we're on the right track. I'll write out my thought process just like I would if I were solving it manually, including brainstorming, checking, and adjusting approaches as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[\n2^{(16^x)} = 16^{(2^x)}\n\\]\n\nmy initial reaction is to recognize that both sides involve exponents with bases that are powers of 2. This reminds me of problems where **exponents are manipulated by expressing both sides with the same base**. However, I'm not entirely sure if that will lead me directly to the solution, so I might need to brainstorm a bit.\n\n#### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Express Both Sides with the Same Base:**\n   - Since 16 is a power of 2 (\\(16 = 2^4\\)), maybe rewriting both sides in terms of base 2 could help.\n\n2. **Logarithmic Approach:**\n   - Applying logarithms might simplify the exponents, allowing for easier manipulation.\n\n3. **Exponent Rules Application:**\n   - Utilizing laws of exponents to simplify expressions on both sides.\n\n4. **Graphical Solution:**\n   - Plotting both sides to find their intersection, though this might be cumbersome without a graphing tool.\n\n5. **Checking for Simple Integer Solutions:**\n   - Before diving deep, maybe check if simple values like \\(x = 0, 1, -1\\) work.\n\nLet me start with the **Same Base Approach**, since expressing both sides with the same base seems straightforward and might lead directly to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expressing Both Sides with the Same Base**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI've noticed that 16 can be rewritten as a power of 2:\n\n\\[\n16 = 2^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the right side becomes:\n\n\\[\n16^{(2^x)} = (2^4)^{(2^x)}\n\\]\n\nUsing the **Power of a Power** exponent rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(2^4)^{(2^x)} = 2^{4 \\cdot 2^x}\n\\]\n\nNow, the equation looks like:\n\n\\[\n2^{(16^x)} = 2^{(4 \\cdot 2^x)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, both sides are now powers of 2. This should make it easier to set the exponents equal to each other since the bases are the same.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting the Exponents Equal**\n\n**Equation After Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n16^x = 4 \\cdot 2^x\n\\]\n\n**Rewriting 16 and 4 in Terms of Base 2:**\n\n\\[\n(2^4)^x = 4 \\cdot 2^x \\implies 2^{4x} = 2^2 \\cdot 2^x\n\\]\n\nCombining the right side:\n\n\\[\n2^{4x} = 2^{2 + x}\n\\]\n\n**Setting Exponents Equal:**\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal:\n\n\\[\n4x = 2 + x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks straightforward. Now, I just need to solve for \\(x\\). But let me quickly check if this step was correct.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Did expressing both sides in terms of base 2 work? Yes, because it allowed me to directly compare the exponents.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)**\n\n**Solving the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n4x = 2 + x\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\(x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n4x - x = 2 \\implies 3x = 2\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems like a valid solution. I'll keep it for now, but before finalizing, let me check if \\(x = \\frac{2}{3}\\) satisfies the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Substituting \\(x = \\frac{2}{3}\\) Back into the Original Equation:**\n\n**Left Side:**\n\n\\[\n2^{(16^{\\frac{2}{3}})} \n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(16^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\):\n\n\\[\n16 = 2^4 \\implies 16^{\\frac{2}{3}} = (2^4)^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 2^{\\frac{8}{3}}\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute back:\n\n\\[\n2^{(2^{\\frac{8}{3}})} \n\\]\n\nThis looks complicated, but let's leave it as is for now and move to the right side.\n\n**Right Side:**\n\n\\[\n16^{(2^{\\frac{2}{3}})} \n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(2^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\):\n\n\\[\n2^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} \n\\]\n\nNow, raise 16 to this power:\n\n\\[\n16^{(2^{\\frac{2}{3}})} = (2^4)^{(2^{\\frac{2}{3}})} = 2^{4 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}}} \n\\]\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nBoth sides simplify to:\n\n\\[\n2^{(2^{\\frac{8}{3}})} = 2^{(4 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}})} \n\\]\n\nWait a second; this doesn't immediately look equal. Let me simplify further to see if they match.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Simplifying Both Sides for Comparison**\n\n**Left Side Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n2^{(2^{\\frac{8}{3}})} \n\\]\n\n**Right Side Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n2^{(4 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}})} \n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Exponents:**\n\nRecall that \\(2^{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\sqrt[3]{2^2} = \\sqrt[3]{4}\\), so:\n\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 4 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{4} = 2^2 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 2^{2 + \\frac{2}{3}} = 2^{\\frac{8}{3}} \n\\]\n\nSo both sides become:\n\n\\[\n2^{(2^{\\frac{8}{3}})} = 2^{(2^{\\frac{8}{3}})} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, after simplifying, both sides are indeed equal. This confirms that \\(x = \\frac{2}{3}\\) is the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nInitially, I explored expressing both sides with the same base, which led me directly to setting the exponents equal. Solving the resulting equation gave me \\(x = \\frac{2}{3}\\). A quick verification step confirmed that this value satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- Expressing both sides in terms of the same base was effective in simplifying the problem.\n- Always verifying the solution helps catch any potential mistakes early.\n- Reflecting after each step ensured that the approach was correct and led to the right solution.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = \\frac{2}{3}}\n\\]",
