    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll approach it as if I'm tackling it for the first time, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on whether each method is correct, and checking my work along the way. I'll make sure to think out loud, sharing any confusions or realizations that come up, just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question is about a television's price being discounted twice, each time by 40%. I need to find out by what percent the original price has been reduced overall.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **This looks similar to problems I've done before.** Reminds me of calculating successive discounts in retail.\n- **I have no idea where to start...** Wait, maybe I need to think about how discounts work on already reduced prices.\n- **Is there a formula for this?** I vaguely remember something about multiplying the fractions remaining after each discount.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Strategy 1:** Maybe I can calculate the price after each discount step and then find the total reduction.\n- **Strategy 2:** Alternatively, use a formula for successive percentage reductions.\n- **Strategy 3:** Calculate the total reduction as a single percentage from the original price.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s start with **Strategy 1**, calculating step by step, and see where that takes me.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the First Discount**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- The television's price is reduced by **40%** in the first discount.\n- I need to determine what that means in terms of the price after the discount.\n\n**Calculations:**\nLet\u2019s assume the original price is \\( P \\).\n\n- **First Discount:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Amount Reduced} = 40\\% \\times P = 0.40P\n  \\]\n  \n- **Price After First Discount:**\n  \\[\n  P_1 = P - 0.40P = 0.60P\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait, that makes sense.** If you discount 40%, you're paying 60% of the original price.\n- **Is this correct?** Yes, because a 40% reduction means you retain 60% of the price.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Second Discount**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- The price is **slashed another 40%**. \n- I need to apply this discount to the already reduced price \\( P_1 = 0.60P \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Second Discount:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Amount Reduced Again} = 40\\% \\times P_1 = 0.40 \\times 0.60P = 0.24P\n  \\]\n  \n- **Price After Second Discount:**\n  \\[\n  P_2 = P_1 - 0.24P = 0.60P - 0.24P = 0.36P\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Hmm, that seems right.** After the second 40% discount on the reduced price, the television costs 36% of the original price.\n- **Is this what I expected?** Yes, a second reduction on a reduced price makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Total Percent Reduction**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- I need to find out **by what percent** the original price \\( P \\) has been reduced to arrive at \\( P_2 = 0.36P \\).\n- This seems like calculating the total percentage decrease from the original price.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Total Reduction:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Reduction} = P - P_2 = P - 0.36P = 0.64P\n  \\]\n  \n- **Percent Reduction:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Percent Reduced} = \\left(\\frac{0.64P}{P}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 64\\%\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Oh! This reminds me of...** When calculating successive discounts, the overall reduction isn't simply adding the percentages. \n- **Actually, that approach worked.** The original price is reduced by 64% overall.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Checking the Work**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Let me think about whether this approach makes sense...** Sequential discounts compound, so the method seems correct.\n- **Quick check:** After two 40% discounts, am I left with 36% of the original price? Yes, because \\( 0.6 \\times 0.6 = 0.36 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Verification:**\n  \\[\n  0.60 \\times 0.60 = 0.36 \\quad \\text{(matches \\( P_2 \\))}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Does the total reduction make sense?**\n  \\[\n  1 - 0.36 = 0.64 \\quad \\text{(64% reduction)}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **That checks out.** The calculations align with the expected outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Using Successive Discount Formula**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Maybe there's a formula I can use to double-check my work.** I remember something like:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Final Price} = P \\times (1 - r_1) \\times (1 - r_2)\n  \\]\n  where \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) are the discount rates.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Applying the formula:**\n  \\[\n  P_2 = P \\times (1 - 0.40) \\times (1 - 0.40) = P \\times 0.60 \\times 0.60 = 0.36P\n  \\]\n  \n- **Total Reduction:**\n  \\[\n  1 - 0.36 = 0.64 \\quad \\text{(or 64\\%)}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **This confirms my earlier result.** Using the formula yields the same total reduction percentage.\n- **Is there an easier way?** I think both methods are valid, but calculating step by step feels more intuitive to me.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Throughout the process,** calculating the price after each discount step ensured accuracy.\n- **Checking the work** at each stage helped confirm that the approach was correct.\n- **Alternative strategy** validated the result, providing a cross-check.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe television's price has been reduced by **64%** from the original price.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nBy exploring different strategies, calculating step by step, and continuously reflecting and checking the work, I've determined that the overall reduction in the television's price is **64%**. This approach ensured accuracy and provided confidence in the final result.",
