    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where our thought process leads us. I'll take you through my brainstorming, checking, and reflecting at each step, just like I would if I were solving it manually.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**User Query:** The operation \\( \\odot \\) is defined as \\( a \\odot b = a + \\frac{3a}{2b} \\). What is the value of \\( 8 \\odot 6 \\)?\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \n- Okay, this looks like a custom operation involving addition and a fraction.\n- It's different from standard operations like addition or multiplication, so I need to be careful.\n- I need to understand how \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) interact within this operation.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Approach 1:** Direct Substitution - Plug values into the formula and compute.\n- **Approach 2:** Simplify the Expression - See if the formula can be simplified before substitution.\n- **Approach 3:** Check for Patterns - Maybe there are patterns with different values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Direct substitution seems straightforward, but is it always correct?\n- Simplifying first might help avoid mistakes.\n- Checking for patterns could provide insights, but for just one problem, it might be overkill.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet's start with **Approach 1: Direct Substitution**. If it feels off or too complicated, we can switch to another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Direct Substitution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- This seems like the most straightforward way. Plug in \\( a = 8 \\) and \\( b = 6 \\) into the operation's definition.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n8 \\odot 6 = 8 + \\frac{3 \\times 8}{2 \\times 6}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 8 + \\frac{24}{12}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 8 + 2\n\\]\n\\[\n= 10\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- Does \\( \\frac{24}{12} = 2 \\)? Yes, that looks correct.\n- Adding 2 to 8 gives 10, which seems reasonable.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- The calculation seems correct at first glance. But let's verify it using a different approach to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with Simplification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Maybe simplifying the expression before substitution can catch any errors or confirm the result.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- Let's simplify \\( a \\odot b = a + \\frac{3a}{2b} \\) step by step.\n\n1. **Factor Out \\( a \\):**\n   \\[\n   a \\odot b = a \\left( 1 + \\frac{3}{2b} \\right)\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Simplify the Parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   1 + \\frac{3}{2b} = \\frac{2b}{2b} + \\frac{3}{2b} = \\frac{2b + 3}{2b}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Rewrite the Expression:**\n   \\[\n   a \\odot b = a \\times \\frac{2b + 3}{2b}\n   \\]\n\n**Applying to Our Case:**\n\\[\n8 \\odot 6 = 8 \\times \\frac{2 \\times 6 + 3}{2 \\times 6} = 8 \\times \\frac{12 + 3}{12} = 8 \\times \\frac{15}{12}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 8 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- Multiplying \\( 8 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = 10 \\). This matches our earlier result.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- The simplified approach also gives 10. This confirms that the direct substitution was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Alternate Strategies**\n\n**User Insight:**  \n- Maybe there's another way to approach this to ensure accuracy or explore different methods.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Approach 3:** Check for Patterns - Could multiple examples show a consistent result?\n- **Approach 4:** Use Proportionality - Since the operation involves fractions, perhaps proportional relationships can be leveraged.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Given the simplicity of the problem and that we've already confirmed the result, exploring further might be unnecessary. However, checking with different values could strengthen our understanding.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet's briefly check another example using **Approach 3: Check for Patterns**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Checking with a Different Example**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Let's see if the operation behaves consistently with another pair of numbers.\n\n**Example:**  \nCompute \\( 4 \\odot 3 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n4 \\odot 3 = 4 + \\frac{3 \\times 4}{2 \\times 3} = 4 + \\frac{12}{6} = 4 + 2 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- The result is 6, which seems logical. It adds another layer of verification to our approach.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- Does \\( \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\)? Yes, correct.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \n- By testing another example, we reinforce that the operation works consistently. This adds confidence to our original solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Validating the Original Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- It's important to ensure that no steps were missed and that the logic holds throughout.\n\n**Reviewing Steps:**\n1. **Direct Substitution:** Initial calculation gave 10.\n2. **Simplification:** Confirmed the same result by factoring and simplifying the expression.\n3. **Pattern Check:** Testing another example provided a consistent result.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Everything aligns. Both approaches lead to the same answer, and testing an additional example confirms the operation's validity.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n8 \\odot 6 = 10\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy approaching the problem step by step, exploring different strategies, and verifying our work through multiple methods, we've confidently determined that \\( 8 \\odot 6 = 10 \\). Reflecting and checking along the way ensured accuracy and deepened our understanding of the operation's mechanics.",
