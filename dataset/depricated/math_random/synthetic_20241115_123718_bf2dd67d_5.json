    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it in real life. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I notice a few key details:\n\n- **Ratio of Work:** Allen and Ben's work ratio is \\(3:5\\).\n- **Total Work Required:** The fence needs \\(240\\) square feet to be painted.\n\nInitially, I'm thinking this involves proportions and maybe dividing the total work based on the given ratio. Ratios are all about comparing quantities, so that seems like a logical starting point.\n\nBut then I wonder if there are other methods, like using fractions or setting up equations. I remember that ratios can be converted into fractions, which might make it easier to handle the total work.\n\nI'm also recalling similar problems where splitting work is involved. It feels somewhat familiar, but I want to make sure I approach it correctly.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use Ratios Directly:** Divide the total area based on the \\(3:5\\) ratio.\n2. **Convert Ratio to Fractions:** Calculate each person's share as a fraction of the total work.\n3. **Set Up an Equation:** Let \\(x\\) be the part Allen paints, and then find Ben's part using the ratio.\n\nLet me start with the first strategy: using the ratio directly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Using Ratios Directly**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf the ratio of Allen's work to Ben's work is \\(3:5\\), it means for every \\(3\\) parts Allen does, Ben does \\(5\\) parts. Together, that's \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) parts.\n\nI can find out how much one part represents in terms of square feet by dividing the total work by the total number of parts.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total parts} = 3 + 5 = 8\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{One part} = \\frac{240 \\text{ sq ft}}{8} = 30 \\text{ sq ft}\n\\]\n\nSo, Allen's work would be \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\) sq ft, and Ben's work would be \\(5 \\times 30 = 150\\) sq ft.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n\\(90 + 150 = 240\\) sq ft. That adds up correctly.\n\n**But Wait...**\n\nLet me double-check this approach. The total aligns, but I want to confirm that splitting the work this way makes sense. The ratio seems straightforward, and dividing by the total parts feels correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis method worked out, but I remember that sometimes using fractions can be more intuitive, especially if the numbers were less clean. Still, since the math checks out, I'll proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Cross-Verifying with Fractions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's try another approach using fractions. If Allen's part is \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) of the total and Ben's part is \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\), that should match our previous calculation.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Allen's share} = \\frac{3}{8} \\times 240 \\text{ sq ft} = 90 \\text{ sq ft}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ben's share} = \\frac{5}{8} \\times 240 \\text{ sq ft} = 150 \\text{ sq ft}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nAgain, \\(90 + 150 = 240\\) sq ft. Everything checks out.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUsing fractions gives the same result, reinforcing that our initial method was correct. It also makes me feel more confident about the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up An Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo explore another strategy, let's set up an equation based on the ratio. Let\u2019s say Allen paints \\(3x\\) sq ft and Ben paints \\(5x\\) sq ft. Together, they paint \\(240\\) sq ft.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n3x + 5x = 240\n\\]\n\n\\[\n8x = 240\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{240}{8} = 30\n\\]\n\nSo, Allen paints \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\) sq ft, and Ben paints \\(5 \\times 30 = 150\\) sq ft.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n\\(3x + 5x = 8x\\) and \\(8 \\times 30 = 240\\). The numbers add up correctly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis method aligns with our previous approaches, confirming the solution's validity. It's always good to verify using different strategies to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's do a quick sanity check:\n\n- **Total Work:** \\(240\\) sq ft\n- **Allen's Share:** \\(90\\) sq ft\n- **Ben's Share:** \\(150\\) sq ft\n- **Ratio Verification:** \\( \\frac{90}{150} = \\frac{3}{5} \\)\n\nEverything matches up perfectly. The ratio holds, and the total work divides correctly between Allen and Ben.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies\u2014direct ratio division, using fractions, and setting up an equation\u2014all methods lead to the same result:\n\n**Ben paints \\(150\\) square feet.**\n\nThis step-by-step approach, including brainstorming different methods, reflecting on each step, and cross-verifying with alternative strategies, ensures a thorough and accurate solution.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough mirrors a human's thought process, complete with initial brainstorming, method exploration, reflections, checks, and adjustments along the way.",

  "ground_truth": "Between them, Allen and Ben are dividing the work into $8$ equal parts, $3$ of which Allen does and $5$ of which Ben does. Each part of the work requires $\\frac{240}{8} = 30$ square feet to be painted. Since Ben does $5$ parts of the work, he will paint $30 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{150}$ square feet of the fence."
