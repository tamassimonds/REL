    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll treat it like a real-life situation where I'm encountering a math problem and brainstorming different strategies to tackle it. I'll reflect often, check my work, and be open to adjusting my approach along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**\"If an integer is divisible by 4 and the sum of its last two digits is 13, then what is the product of its last two digits?\"**\n\nMy immediate reaction is:\n\n- **Divisibility by 4:** I remember that an integer is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. That's a key property I can leverage here.\n  \n- **Sum of Last Two Digits:** Given that the sum of the last two digits is 13, I need to find pairs of digits that add up to 13.\n  \n- **Product of Last Two Digits:** Finally, I'm looking for the product of those two digits.\n\nThis looks like a problem that involves both combinatorial thinking (finding digit pairs) and number theory (divisibility rules). But I'm not entirely sure how to connect these two aspects right away. Let me brainstorm a bit more.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List All Possible Digit Pairs:**\n   - Since I'm dealing with single-digit numbers, I could list all pairs of digits that sum up to 13.\n\n2. **Check Each Pair for Divisibility by 4:**\n   - After identifying the valid digit pairs, I can check which of these pairs form numbers divisible by 4.\n\n3. **Calculate the Product of Valid Pairs:**\n   - Finally, I would compute the product for each valid pair to determine the answer.\n\nOkay, this seems like a logical approach. But before jumping in, I want to think about whether there's a more efficient way. \n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Listing All Pairs:** This could be time-consuming if there are many pairs.\n- **Divisibility Check:** Maybe there's a pattern or a shortcut I can use with the divisibility rule.\n\n**Wait a moment!**  \nI just recalled that for a two-digit number to be divisible by 4, only the last two digits need to be divisible by 4, not the entire number. This might help narrow down the pairs more efficiently.\n\nThinking about it, perhaps I can interleave the strategies\u2014start by listing pairs that sum to 13, then filter them based on divisibility by 4.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: List All Possible Digit Pairs That Sum to 13**\n\nLet's start by identifying all pairs of single digits (0-9) that add up to 13:\n\n- (4, 9)\n- (5, 8)\n- (6, 7)\n- (7, 6)\n- (8, 5)\n- (9, 4)\n\n**Wait, should I consider (0, 13)?**  \nBut 13 is not a single-digit number, so I can only use digits from 0 to 9. Therefore, the pairs listed above are correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes each pair sum to 13? Yes, they do.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Check Which of These Pairs Are Divisible by 4**\n\nNow, I need to check which of these pairs, when considered as two-digit numbers, are divisible by 4. Remember, a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet's examine each pair:\n\n1. **(4, 9)** \u2192 49\n   - 49 \u00f7 4 = 12.25 \u2192 **Not divisible**\n\n2. **(5, 8)** \u2192 58\n   - 58 \u00f7 4 = 14.5 \u2192 **Not divisible**\n\n3. **(6, 7)** \u2192 67\n   - 67 \u00f7 4 = 16.75 \u2192 **Not divisible**\n\n4. **(7, 6)** \u2192 76\n   - 76 \u00f7 4 = 19 \u2192 **Divisible**\n\n5. **(8, 5)** \u2192 85\n   - 85 \u00f7 4 = 21.25 \u2192 **Not divisible**\n\n6. **(9, 4)** \u2192 94\n   - 94 \u00f7 4 = 23.5 \u2192 **Not divisible**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOnly the pair **(7, 6)** results in a number (76) that is divisible by 4.\n\n**Does this make sense?**  \nIt seems correct because 76 is divisible by 4. Let's move forward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Product of the Valid Pair (7, 6)**\n\nNow, I need to find the product of the digits in the valid pair:\n\n\\[\n7 \\times 6 = 42\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes the product make sense given the conditions? Yes, the pair (7, 6) satisfies both the sum and divisibility conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's quickly review each step to ensure everything aligns:\n\n1. **Identifying Digit Pairs:**  \n   - Correctly listed all single-digit pairs that sum to 13.\n\n2. **Divisibility Check:**  \n   - Only the pair (7, 6) resulted in a number divisible by 4.\n\n3. **Calculating Product:**  \n   - Computed the product of the valid pair: 7 \u00d7 6 = 42.\n\n**Does the approach feel complete?**  \nYes, each step logically followed the previous one, and the conditions were consistently applied.\n\n**Potential Mistake:**  \nInitially, I considered listing all pairs and checking each for divisibility. However, reflecting on the divisibility rule for 4 helped streamline the process, reducing unnecessary checks.\n\n**Would there be another way to approach this?**  \nAlternatively, one could perhaps look for patterns or properties specific to numbers where the sum of digits is a certain value, but that might complicate things unnecessarily for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe product of the last two digits is **42**.\n\n---\n\nBy walking through each step carefully, checking my work along the way, and being open to adjusting my approach, I've arrived at the solution confidently.",

  "ground_truth": "If $A$ is the tens digit and $B$ the units digit, then the two-digit number $AB$ (having $A$ in the tens place and $B$ in the units place) must be one of the following: $49$, $58$, $67$, $76$, $85$, $94$.  Since the original number was divisible by $4$, $AB$ must be divisible by $4$.  So $AB = 76$ is the only possibility, and $A\\cdot B = 7\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{42}$."
