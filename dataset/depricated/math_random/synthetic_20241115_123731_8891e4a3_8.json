    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through different strategies, reflecting on their correctness, and adjusting our approach as needed. I'll brainstorm initially, explore various methods, check my work frequently, and be open to changing direction if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, I see three congruences involving integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) from the set of positive integers less than \\(7\\). The goal is to find the remainder when \\(a + b + c\\) is divided by \\(7\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Congruences:** This reminds me of problems involving modular arithmetic and solving systems of congruences, similar to the Chinese Remainder Theorem. \n- **Positive Integers Less Than 7:** Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all positive integers less than \\(7\\), each can be \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\\) or \\(6\\).\n- **Equations Given:** We have three equations to satisfy simultaneously. My first thought is that all three must hold true for a single set of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Maybe I could tackle these one at a time, seeing how they interrelate, or perhaps look for patterns by testing possible values.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Sequential Solving:** Attempt to solve each congruence step-by-step, using the results to inform the next. Start with the one that's easiest to solve.\n   \n2. **Trial and Error:** Given the small set of possible values, perhaps testing each combination to see which ones satisfy all three conditions.\n\n3. **Substitution Method:** Use one congruence to express one variable in terms of others and substitute into the remaining equations.\n\n4. **System of Congruences:** Treat the problem as a system of modular equations and apply methods for solving such systems.\n\nLet me start with the **Sequential Solving** method, as it seems the most straightforward. If that doesn't work, I'll pivot to **Trial and Error**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Solving the First Congruence**\n\n**Given:**\n\n$$abc \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$$\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to find positive integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) less than \\(7\\) such that their product is congruent to \\(1\\) modulo \\(7\\). In modular arithmetic, this implies that \\(abc\\) must be the multiplicative inverse of \\(1\\) modulo \\(7\\).\n\n**Exploring:**\n\nWait, I recall that in modulo \\(7\\), the inverses are numbers that, when multiplied with the original number, give a remainder of \\(1\\). But \\(1\\) is its own inverse. So, I need \\(abc\\) to be congruent to \\(1\\).\n\nBut, there are multiple combinations possible. Maybe I can narrow it down by considering the other two congruences.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSince \\(7\\) is prime, every number less than \\(7\\) has an inverse. However, without more information, this doesn't narrow down \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) specifically.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this help? Not really, because too many possibilities remain. Let's move on to the next congruence to gather more information.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Second Congruence**\n\n**Given:**\n\n$$5c \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to find \\(c\\) such that when multiplied by \\(5\\), the result is congruent to \\(2\\) modulo \\(7\\). This seems more straightforward.\n\n**Exploring:**\n\nMaybe I can multiply both sides by the multiplicative inverse of \\(5\\) modulo \\(7\\). I know from previous problems that the inverse of \\(5\\) modulo \\(7\\) is \\(3\\) because \\(5 \\times 3 = 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSo, multiplying both sides by \\(3\\):\n\n$$3 \\times 5c \\equiv 3 \\times 2 \\pmod{7}$$\n$$15c \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$$\n$$c \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$$\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, but \\(c\\) must be less than \\(7\\), so \\(c = 6\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes \\(5 \\times 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}\\)?\n$$5 \\times 6 = 30 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$\n\nYes, this works! So \\(c = 6\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Third Congruence**\n\n**Given:**\n\n$$6b \\equiv 3 + b \\pmod{7}$$\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThis looks a bit tricky because it's an equation involving \\(b\\) on both sides. Let's rearrange it to make it easier to solve.\n\n**Exploring:**\n\nSubtract \\(b\\) from both sides to simplify:\n\n$$6b - b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$$\n$$5b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$$\n\nNow, I need to find \\(b\\) such that \\(5b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\\). This is similar to the second congruence we solved.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nAgain, I'll multiply both sides by the inverse of \\(5\\) modulo \\(7\\), which we found to be \\(3\\):\n\n$$3 \\times 5b \\equiv 3 \\times 3 \\pmod{7}$$\n$$15b \\equiv 9 \\pmod{7}$$\n$$b \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSince \\(b\\) must be less than \\(7\\), \\(b = 2\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes \\(6 \\times 2 \\equiv 3 + 2 \\pmod{7}\\)?\n\n$$12 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 3 + 2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$$\n\nYes, both sides are equal, so \\(b = 2\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding \\(a\\) Using the First Congruence**\n\nNow that we have \\(b = 2\\) and \\(c = 6\\), let's return to the first congruence to find \\(a\\).\n\n**Given:**\n\n$$abc \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$$\n\nSubstituting \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) into the equation:\n\n$$a \\times 2 \\times 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$$\n$$12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$$\n$$5a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$$ \\(\\text{(since } 12 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}\\text{)}\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to find \\(a\\) such that \\(5a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\\). This is a standard inverse problem.\n\n**Exploring:**\n\nFrom earlier, the inverse of \\(5\\) modulo \\(7\\) is \\(3\\). So, multiplying both sides by \\(3\\):\n\n$$a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$$\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSince \\(a\\) must be less than \\(7\\), \\(a = 3\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\\)?\n\n$$36 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$$\n\nYes, \\(36 \\div 7 = 5\\) with a remainder of \\(1\\), so \\(a = 3\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating \\(a + b + c\\)**\n\nNow that we have \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 2\\), and \\(c = 6\\), let's find \\(a + b + c\\):\n\n$$a + b + c = 3 + 2 + 6 = 11$$\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to find the remainder when \\(11\\) is divided by \\(7\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me quickly check if \\(11 \\div 7 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\). So, \\(11 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes \\(11 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}\\)?\n\nYes, because \\(11 - 7 = 4\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe remainder when \\(a + b + c\\) is divided by \\(7\\) is **4**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Checking**\n\n- **Did the Approach Work?** Yes, by sequentially solving the congruences, we found consistent values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) that satisfy all three conditions.\n- **Reflection:** Each step built upon the previous one, ensuring that the variables were correctly determined. The checks confirmed that each congruence was satisfied with the found values.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Initially considered trial and error, but the sequential solving proved efficient. If the numbers were larger, a more systematic approach like the Chinese Remainder Theorem might have been necessary.\n\nOverall, the step-by-step approach ensured accuracy, with frequent checks verifying the correctness of each phase.",
