We'll treat this like a real-world problem where exploring different approaches is essential.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I see the question, \"What is the value of the 25th term of the arithmetic sequence \\(2, 5, 8, \\ldots\\)?\", the first thing that strikes me is familiarity. This looks like an **arithmetic sequence**\u2014a sequence where each term differs by a constant value from the previous one. \n\nBut let's **brainstorm** a bit:\n\n- **Is it arithmetic?** Yes, because the difference between consecutive terms is the same.\n- **What do I know about arithmetic sequences?** There's always a **common difference**, and you can find any term using a specific formula.\n- **What\u2019s the question asking?** It's asking for the **25th term**, which means I'll need to extend the sequence quite a bit.\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\n\n- **Use the arithmetic sequence formula:** I remember there's a formula to find the \\(n\\)th term.\n- **Calculate a few terms to see the pattern:** Maybe that will help confirm the formula.\n- **Check if there's a simpler method:** Perhaps there's a shortcut for finding the 25th term directly.\n\nLet's start by exploring these options.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n### **Strategy 1: Use the Arithmetic Sequence Formula**\n\nThe formula for the \\(n\\)th term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \\times d\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(a_n\\) = the \\(n\\)th term\n- \\(a_1\\) = the first term\n- \\(d\\) = the common difference\n- \\(n\\) = the term number\n\n**Reflection:** \nThis formula seems straightforward and should work. But before applying it, I should confirm the values needed.\n\n### **Strategy 2: Calculate a Few Terms Manually**\n\nAnother approach is to simply extend the sequence by adding the common difference repeatedly. This might take longer but can serve as a check for the formula.\n\n**Common Difference:**\nLooking at the sequence:\n- \\(5 - 2 = 3\\)\n- \\(8 - 5 = 3\\)\n\nSo, the **common difference \\(d = 3\\)**.\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this match the initial terms? Yes, it does.\n\n### **Strategy 3: Check for a Faster Method**\n\nGiven that we're looking for the **25th term**, perhaps there's a way to verify our calculations to ensure efficiency.\n\n**Thought:**\nWait, calculating each term up to 25 manually might be cumbersome. The formula should save time, but perhaps I can verify it by checking the pattern.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Applying Strategy 1 \u2013 Using the Formula**\n\nNow, let's apply the arithmetic sequence formula.\n\n**Given:**\n- \\(a_1 = 2\\)\n- \\(d = 3\\)\n- \\(n = 25\\)\n\n**Plugging into the formula:**\n\n\\[\na_{25} = 2 + (25 - 1) \\times 3\n\\]\n\\[\na_{25} = 2 + 24 \\times 3\n\\]\n\\[\na_{25} = 2 + 72\n\\]\n\\[\na_{25} = 74\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\nHmm, \\(74\\) seems reasonable. But let's **pause and check** if this calculation aligns with the sequence's logic.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Verifying the Calculation**\n\n**Quick Check:**\nIs \\(74\\) consistent with the common difference?\n\n- Starting from \\(a_1 = 2\\):\n  - \\(a_2 = 2 + 3 = 5\\)\n  - \\(a_3 = 5 + 3 = 8\\)\n  - ...\n\n**Does this pattern seem correct?**\nContinuing this way to \\(a_{25}\\) confirms consistency because each term adds \\(3\\) to the previous one.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe formula worked correctly, and the calculation aligns with the sequence's pattern.\n\n**But wait:**\nBefore concluding, maybe I can **cross-check** by calculating a few more terms to ensure everything aligns.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Alternative Approach \u2013 Calculating Terms Manually**\n\nLet's calculate a few more terms to see if the trend holds:\n\n- \\(a_4 = 8 + 3 = 11\\)\n- \\(a_5 = 11 + 3 = 14\\)\n- \\(a_6 = 14 + 3 = 17\\)\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this match the expected sequence? Yes, each term is \\(3\\) more than the previous one.\n\n**Thought:**\nThis manual calculation aligns with the formula's result, adding confidence to the answer.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Considering Another Strategy \u2013 Sum of Terms**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\nIs there a way to use the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms to find the 25th term?\n\n**Sum Formula:**\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n)\n\\]\n\nBut I realized that knowing \\(S_n\\) isn't directly helpful here since we don't have it.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis approach doesn't seem applicable without additional information, so it's better to stick with the formula.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 7: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Calculation Verification:**\n\nReturning to the formula:\n\n\\[\na_{25} = 2 + (25 - 1) \\times 3 = 2 + 24 \\times 3 = 2 + 72 = 74\n\\]\n\n**Thought:**\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because each term increases by \\(3\\), and starting from \\(2\\), reaching \\(74\\) over \\(24\\) increments (from \\(a_2\\) to \\(a_{25}\\)) is logical.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe answer \\(74\\) is consistent with the sequence's rules, and multiple strategies have confirmed its validity.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{74}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\nThroughout this problem:\n\n- I started by confirming the sequence type and identifying key components.\n- I explored different strategies: applying the arithmetic sequence formula, calculating terms manually, and considering the sum formula.\n- By applying the formula and verifying with manual calculations, I ensured the accuracy of the result.\n- Alternative approaches that didn't fit were discarded, keeping the process efficient.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with reflections and checks along the way, led to a confident and correct solution: the 25th term is **74**.",
