    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect frequently, and check my work as I go. Let\u2019s begin by really understanding what's being asked.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**User Query:**\nAddison's age is three times Brenda's age. Janet is six years older than Brenda. Addison and Janet are twins. How old is Brenda?\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Twin Connection:** Wait, Addison and Janet are twins? That implies they are the same age. But the question states Addison is three times Brenda's age. Something feels off here because if Addison and Janet are twins, they should be the same age.\n- **Age Relationships:** We have multiple relationships: Addison is three times Brenda\u2019s age, Janet is six years older than Brenda, and Addison and Janet are twins. \n- **Logical Inconsistency:** Hmm, if Addison and Janet are twins, how can Addison be three times Brenda's age? That seems impossible unless the ages are relative or perhaps the term \"twins\" is being used differently here.\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Possible Misinterpretation:** Maybe I\u2019m misinterpreting the term \"twins.\" Could it be that Addison and Janet are nominally referred to as twins in this scenario, perhaps as a nickname or within a specific context?\n- **Need for More Clarity:** Before proceeding, it\u2019s crucial to clarify this inconsistency. Let's check if the problem statement is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Initial Conclusion:** If Addison and Janet are truly twins, then their ages must be identical, which contradicts the given information that Addison is three times Brenda's age. This suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or in my initial understanding.\n\n**Next Step:**\n- **Approach Considering the Mistake:** Perhaps the relationship involving \"twins\" is misapplied. Let's explore different strategies to see if we can make sense of the relationships despite this inconsistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Second Thoughts: Exploring Strategies**\n\n**User, Please Confirm:**\nBefore proceeding, I want to ensure I'm on the right track. Is the problem statement indeed correct? If yes, how should I interpret the \"twins\" aspect? If there's a typo or miscommunication, please clarify.\n\n*Assuming the statement is correct, and perhaps \"twins\" is metaphorical or misused here.*\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Algebraic Approach:** Use variables to represent each person\u2019s age and set up equations based on the given relationships.\n2. **Logical Reasoning:** Attempt to deduce relationships without formal equations, relying on logical consistency.\n3. **Graphical Representation:** Visualize the relationships in a diagram (though this might be less straightforward with age relationships).\n\n**Choosing a Strategy:**\n- **Algebra Seems Direct:** Given the numerical relationships, using algebra seems like a straightforward method to formalize the given conditions.\n- **Logical Checks Essential:** However, given the initial inconsistency, it's vital to incorporate logical checks to ensure the solution makes sense.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Potential for Complexity:** Introducing algebra might complicate things if the relationships are misunderstood. \n- **Safety in Equations:** But equations can help clarify the relationships, provided they are set up correctly.\n\n**Next Step:**\n- **Proceed with Algebra:** Let's set up equations assuming the problem statement is correct, but remain vigilant for any inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equations**\n\n**Assign Variables:**\n- Let\u2019s denote:\n  - \\( B \\) = Brenda's age\n  - \\( A \\) = Addison's age\n  - \\( J \\) = Janet's age\n  \n**Given Relationships Translated into Equations:**\n1. **Addison's Age:** \\( A = 3B \\) (Addison is three times Brenda's age)\n2. **Janet's Age:** \\( J = B + 6 \\) (Janet is six years older than Brenda)\n3. **Addison and Janet as Twins:** \\( A = J \\) (Addison and Janet are twins, so their ages are equal)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Initial Equation Setup:** At first glance, these equations seem straightforward. But recalling that Addison and Janet are twins, meaning \\( A = J \\), creates a crucial connection between the equations.\n  \n**Next Step:**\n- **Substituting Equations:** Since \\( A = J \\), we can substitute \\( A \\) from the first equation into the third equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting to Simplify**\n\n**Substitute \\( A = 3B \\) into \\( A = J \\):**\n- \\( 3B = J \\)\n  \n**Now We Have:**\n1. \\( J = 3B \\) (from the above substitution)\n2. \\( J = B + 6 \\) (from Janet's age)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Two Equations, One Unknown:** Now I have two equations:\n  - \\( J = 3B \\)\n  - \\( J = B + 6 \\)\n  \n- **This Should Be Solvable:** It seems logical to set these equal to each other since both equal \\( J \\).\n\n**Next Step:**\n- **Set Equations Equal:** \\( 3B = B + 6 \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for Brenda's Age**\n\n**Solve the Equation \\( 3B = B + 6 \\):**\n- **Subtract \\( B \\) from Both Sides:**\n  - \\( 3B - B = 6 \\)\n  - \\( 2B = 6 \\)\n  \n- **Divide by 2:**\n  - \\( B = 3 \\)\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Brenda's Age Calculated:** According to these calculations, Brenda is 3 years old.\n  \n- **Quick Check:** Wait, does a 3-year-old have a sibling who's three times her age? That would make Addison 9, and if Janet is six years older than Brenda, that would make Janet 9 as well. But... if Addison is supposed to be 9, and Janet is also 9, how can Janet be 6 years older than Brenda? This doesn't add up. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Inconsistency Detected:** There\u2019s a clear inconsistency here. If Brenda is 3, Janet should be 9 (3 + 6), but the problem states Addison is three times Brenda's age, making her 9, which conflicts with Janet being 9 as well.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Error in Assumptions:** It seems that there's an error in the initial assumptions or the way the equations were set up.\n  \n- **Possible Misinterpretation:** Maybe the term \"twins\" is causing confusion. If Addison and Janet are twins, they should be the same age, but the problem states differing relationships that lead to this inconsistency.\n\n**Next Step:**\n- **Re-evaluate the Approach:** Given this conflict, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem's wording. Let\u2019s brainstorm alternative strategies or consider that the problem might have an error.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n**Possible Alternative Interpretations:**\n- **Misleading Information:** Perhaps the \"twins\" aspect is irrelevant or incorrectly applied in the problem statement.\n  \n- **Typographical Error:** Maybe there's a typo, and the relationship involving \"twins\" should be different.\n\n- **Simpler Relationships:** Perhaps the relationships are simpler than initially thought, and the \"twins\" information is extraneous.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Ignoring the Twin Aspect:** If we temporarily set aside the \"twins\" information, can we still solve the problem logically with the remaining relationships?\n  \n- **Testing Without Twins:** Let\u2019s see if the other relationships provide a consistent solution without relying on Addison and Janet being twins.\n\n**Next Step:**\n- **Simplify the Problem:** Attempt to solve using only the other given relationships to see if a consistent age can be deduced.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Simplifying the Problem**\n\n**Given Relationships Without Twins:**\n1. **Addison's Age:** \\( A = 3B \\)\n2. **Janet's Age:** \\( J = B + 6 \\)\n\n**Solving for \\( B \\):**\n- **Substitute \\( J = B + 6 \\) into \\( A = J \\):**\n  - But since we have \\( A = 3B \\), and if \\( A = J \\), then \\( J = 3B \\).\n  \n- **Set \\( 3B = B + 6 \\):**\n  - As solved earlier: \\( 2B = 6 \\)\n  - \\( B = 3 \\)\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Brenda's Age Remains 3:** Regardless of whether we consider the \"twins\" information, Brenda's age consistently calculates to 3.\n  \n- **Inconsistency Still Present:** However, the previous inconsistency about Janet being older than Brenda by 6 years still exists because if Brenda is 3, Janet should be 9, and Addison should be 9 as well. But if Addison is 9, being three times Brenda\u2019s age, it contradicts Janet being 9 and 6 years older than Brenda.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Logical Contradiction:** There\u2019s a fundamental contradiction in the problem's relationships. If Addison is three times Brenda's age and also Janet's twin (same age), it creates an impossible scenario unless the age relationships are misapplied.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Flaw in Problem Statement:** This suggests a flaw in the problem statement itself. If the relationships are intended to be correct, the only logical conclusion is that Brenda is 3, but this leads to contradictions in the other relationships.\n\n**Next Step:**\n- **Addressing the Inconsistency:** To move forward, we can either:\n  1. **Assume the Problem Statement Is Incorrect:** Acknowledge that there\u2019s likely a typo or miscommunication in the problem.\n  2. **Seek Clarification:** Ask for clarification on the problem statement to ensure all terms are correctly interpreted.\n  \n- **Since User Might Not Be Available:** Let\u2019s proceed under the assumption that the problem is indeed as stated, but recognize that the \"twins\" information might be inaccurately applied.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finalizing the Solution**\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n- Based on the consistent equations:\n  - \\( A = 3B \\)\n  - \\( J = B + 6 \\)\n  - \\( A = J \\)\n  \n- **Solving for \\( B \\):**\n  - \\( 3B = J \\)\n  - \\( J = B + 6 \\)\n  - Setting \\( 3B = B + 6 \\) \u21d2 \\( 2B = 6 \\) \u21d2 \\( B = 3 \\)\n  \n**Brenda\u2019s Age:**\n- **Brenda is 3 Years Old.**\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Age Consistency:** Brenda being 3 years old leads to:\n  - Addison\u2019s Age: \\( A = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\)\n  - Janet\u2019s Age: \\( J = 3 + 6 = 9 \\)\n  \n- **Contradiction with Twin Status:** This results in Addison and Janet both being 9 years old, which aligns with being twins, but creates a conflict with the initial statement that Addison is three times Brenda's age. If Addison is three times Brenda's age, she would be 9, making Brenda 3, which is fine, but then Janet should be 9 (as per the twin condition), creating a redundancy since both Janet and Addison are 9.\n\n**Possible Pollyanna Solution:**\n- **Ignoring the Twin Aspect:** If we assume that the twin information is extraneous, the problem's relationships still consistently lead to Brenda being 3 years old.\n  \n- **Accepting the Contradiction:** Perhaps the \"twins\" detail is unnecessary for solving the problem, and thus, the main relationships remain intact despite this inconsistency.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n- **Key Realization:** The essential relationships are sufficient to determine Brenda's age. The mention of Addison and Janet being twins adds complexity but isn't crucial for solving the problem.\n  \n- **Final Answer:** **Brenda is 3 years old.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Addison\u2019s Age:** \\( A = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\)\n- **Janet\u2019s Age:** \\( J = 3 + 6 = 9 \\)\n\n**Consistency Check:**\n- **Addison and Janet Both 9:** This aligns with the \"twins\" condition, but it conflicts with the age relationship that Addison is three times Brenda\u2019s age. However, mathematically, it still holds since \\( 9 = 3 \\times 3 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Solution Validity:** Despite the logical inconsistency regarding the twin aspect, the arithmetic relationships correctly lead to Brenda being 3 years old.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Importance of Clear Problem Statements:** This exercise highlights the necessity for precise and unambiguous problem statements to avoid confusion and ensure logical consistency in solutions.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- **Brenda is 3 years old.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought:**\n\n**Mfw I Realized:**\n- Initially, the mention of \"twins\" threw me off because if Addison and Janet are twins, they should be the same age, which conflicted with the given relationships. However, by focusing solely on the mathematical relationships and setting aside the twin detail as potentially extraneous or misapplied, I was able to consistently arrive at Brenda being 3 years old. This approach demonstrates that sometimes, irrelevant details in a problem statement can complicate things but can be managed by concentrating on the core relationships that matter.\n\n--- \n\n**User, Please Confirm:**\nI\u2019ve walked through various strategies, acknowledged inconsistencies, and focused on the essential relationships to determine Brenda\u2019s age. If there\u2019s still something off or if my interpretation of the \"twins\" aspect is incorrect, please let me know. Otherwise, Brenda is 3 years old according to the calculations.",

  "ground_truth": "First, let $A = $ Addison's age, $B = $ Brenda's age, and $J = $ Janet's age. Then, from the statements given, we have the following system of equations:  $$\\begin{cases}\nA=3B \\\\\nJ = B+6 \\\\\nA=J\n\\end{cases} $$ Since $A=J$, we know that $3B=B+6$. Solving this equation, we have that $2B = 6 \\Rightarrow B=3$. Thus, Brenda is $\\boxed{3}$ years old."
