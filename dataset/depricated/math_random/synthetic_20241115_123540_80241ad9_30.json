    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were tackling it for the first time. I\u2019ll openly explore different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure to check my work along the way. Let's brainstorm and see where it leads us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the question asks me to compute the determinant of a 2x2 matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix} -5 & 3 \\\\ 4 & -4 \\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWhen I first see this, I think, \"Hmm, I\u2019ve dealt with determinants before. I remember there\u2019s a specific formula for 2x2 matrices.\" But, to be thorough, let me brainstorm a few strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Determinant Formula for 2x2 Matrices:**  \n   I recall that for a 2x2 matrix \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\\), the determinant is computed as \\(ad - bc\\). This seems straightforward.\n\n2. **Expand Using Cofactors:**  \n   Maybe I could expand the determinant using cofactor expansion, even though it's more common for larger matrices. But would that be overkill here?\n\n3. **Visual Representation or Geometric Interpretation:**  \n   I remember that the determinant can represent the area of the parallelogram formed by the column vectors. This might help in visualizing, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll help with the calculation itself.\n\n4. **Check for Special Properties:**  \n   Perhaps the matrix has properties like being diagonal or having zero determinants that could simplify things. But looking at it, I don\u2019t see any obvious simplifications.\n\n---\n\n### **Choosing a Strategy**\n\nGiven these options, the **first strategy** seems the most straightforward: using the determinant formula for 2x2 matrices. It\u2019s simple and directly applicable. Expanding using cofactors feels unnecessary for a 2x2 matrix, and checking for special properties doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nSo, let's go ahead with the **determinant formula**:\n\n\\[\n\\det(A) = ad - bc\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A = \\begin{pmatrix} -5 & 3 \\\\ 4 & -4 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Determinant Formula**\n\nLet\u2019s assign the elements of the matrix to the formula:\n\n\\[\na = -5, \\quad b = 3, \\quad c = 4, \\quad d = -4\n\\]\n\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\det(A) = (-5)(-4) - (3)(4)\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n\\[\n(-5)(-4) = 20\n\\]\n\\[\n(3)(4) = 12\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract these two results:\n\n\\[\n20 - 12 = 8\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection: Checking the Calculation**\n\nHmm, let me pause and check if this makes sense. The product of negative and negative is positive (20), and the product of positive and positive is 12. So, \\(20 - 12 = 8\\), which seems correct.\n\nBut just to be sure, I\u2019ll consider the geometric interpretation: The determinant of a 2x2 matrix represents the area of the parallelogram formed by its column vectors. A positive determinant here indicates that the area is 8 and that the orientation is preserved (no reflections).\n\nThis aligns with our calculation, so it seems correct. But let\u2019s continue to ensure everything is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with an Alternate Method**\n\nJust to make sure everything is correct, let\u2019s attempt a different method: **expanding using cofactor expansion**. Even though it\u2019s typically used for larger matrices, let's see how it applies here.\n\nFor a 2x2 matrix, cofactor expansion is quite similar to the determinant formula. But let\u2019s write it out to see if we get the same result.\n\n\\[\n\\det(A) = (-1)^{1+1} \\times a \\times \\det\\begin{pmatrix} d \\end{pmatrix} + (-1)^{1+2} \\times b \\times \\det\\begin{pmatrix} c \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nApplying this to our matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\det(A) = a \\times d + (-1) \\times b \\times c\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\det(A) = (-5)(-4) + (-1)(3)(4)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 20 - 12\n\\]\n\\[\n= 8\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection: Comparing Both Methods**\n\nBoth methods yield the same determinant: **8**. This consistency is reassuring. It confirms that our initial approach using the determinant formula was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let\u2019s do a final check:\n\n- **Determinant Formula Application:**  \n  \\( (-5)(-4) - (3)(4) = 20 - 12 = 8 \\)\n\n- **Cofactor Expansion:**  \n  \\( (-5)(-4) + (-1)(3)(4) = 20 - 12 = 8 \\)\n\n- **Geometric Interpretation:**  \n  The area of the parallelogram formed by the column vectors is 8, and the orientation is preserved.\n\nEverything checks out. The determinant is indeed **8**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014applying the determinant formula and verifying with cofactor expansion\u2014we ensured the correctness of our solution. Reflecting and checking at each step helped catch any potential mistakes early on. It\u2019s always a good practice to verify calculations using multiple methods, especially when the result feels significant.\n\nIn conclusion, the determinant of the given matrix is **8**.",
