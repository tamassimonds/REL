    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through it just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust my approach as needed. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\n- **Given Information:** The graphs of \\( y = h(x) \\) and \\( y = j(x) \\) intersect at four points: \\( (2, 2) \\), \\( (4, 6) \\), \\( (6, 12) \\), and \\( (8, 12) \\).\n- **New Functions:** \\( y = h(2x) \\) and \\( y = 2j(x) \\).\n- **Goal:** Find the point where these new graphs intersect and calculate the sum of its coordinates.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- I need to find where \\( h(2x) = 2j(x) \\).\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Substitute Known Points:** Use the given intersection points to find relationships between \\( h(x) \\) and \\( j(x) \\).\n  2. **Analyze Transformations:** Understand how the transformations \\( h(2x) \\) and \\( 2j(x) \\) affect the graphs.\n  3. **Look for Symmetry or Patterns:** See if there's a pattern that simplifies finding the intersection.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Substituting known points seems like a straightforward starting point.\n- Analyzing transformations might help confirm the locations.\n- I\u2019ll start with substitution and see where it leads.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the Substitution Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's consider the given intersection points of \\( h(x) \\) and \\( j(x) \\).\n- If \\( (2, 2) \\) is an intersection, then \\( h(2) = j(2) = 2 \\).\n- Similarly, apply this to the other points.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- From \\( (2, 2) \\): \n  - \\( h(2) = 2 \\)\n  - \\( j(2) = 2 \\)\n  \n- From \\( (4, 6) \\): \n  - \\( h(4) = 6 \\)\n  - \\( j(4) = 6 \\)\n  \n- From \\( (6, 12) \\): \n  - \\( h(6) = 12 \\)\n  - \\( j(6) = 12 \\)\n  \n- From \\( (8, 12) \\): \n  - \\( h(8) = 12 \\)\n  - \\( j(8) = 12 \\)\n\n**Check:**\n- This seems consistent. Each point satisfies both \\( h(x) \\) and \\( j(x) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Now, I need to see how these points relate to \\( h(2x) \\) and \\( 2j(x) \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Substitution to \\( h(2x) \\) and \\( 2j(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- For \\( h(2x) \\), I need to find \\( x \\) such that \\( 2x \\) matches the input of \\( h \\) at known points.\n- Similarly, for \\( 2j(x) \\), I\u2019ll consider how the input relates to the known points.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Finding Intersection for \\( h(2x) = 2j(x) \\):**\n\n   - Set \\( h(2x) = 2j(x) \\).\n   \n   - Based on the given points:\n     - \\( h(2) = 2 \\) and \\( j(2) = 2 \\)\n     - \\( h(4) = 6 \\) and \\( j(4) = 6 \\)\n     - \\( h(6) = 12 \\) and \\( j(6) = 12 \\)\n     - \\( h(8) = 12 \\) and \\( j(8) = 12 \\)\n\n2. **Solving for Each Known Point:**\n\n   - **For \\( x = 1 \\):**\n     - \\( 2x = 2 \\)\n     - \\( h(2) = 2 \\) and \\( j(2) = 2 \\)\n     - \\( h(2) = 2j(1) \\) \u21d2 \\( 2 = 2j(1) \\) \u21d2 \\( j(1) = 1 \\)\n     - \\( h(2) = 2j(1) \\) \u21d2 \\( 2 = 2 \\times 1 \\) \u21d2 \\( h(2) = 2 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   \n   - **For \\( x = 2 \\):**\n     - \\( 2x = 4 \\)\n     - \\( h(4) = 6 \\) and \\( j(4) = 6 \\)\n     - \\( h(4) = 2j(2) \\) \u21d2 \\( 6 = 2 \\times 2 \\) \u21d2 \\( 6 = 4 \\) \u2716\ufe0f\n     - **Wait**, this creates an inconsistency.\n\n**Check:**\n- There's an inconsistency for \\( x = 2 \\). This suggests that not all points will satisfy \\( h(2x) = 2j(x) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Maybe I need to reconsider which points to use or look for a different approach since not all substitutions work.\n\n### **Step 4: Re-evaluating the Substitution Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The point \\( x = 2 \\) led to a contradiction.\n- Perhaps only certain points from the original intersections are relevant for the new functions.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Instead of testing all given points, identify a specific point where the transformations simplify the equations.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Notice:** The graphs \\( y = h(2x) \\) and \\( y = 2j(x) \\) involve scaling the input and output.\n  \n- **Potential Candidate:** \\( x = 4 \\)\n  \n  - **Calculating \\( h(2 \\times 4) = h(8) \\):**\n    - From given points, \\( h(8) = 12 \\)\n    \n  - **Calculating \\( 2j(4) \\):**\n    - From given points, \\( j(4) = 6 \\)\n    - So, \\( 2j(4) = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\)\n    \n  - **Comparison:** \\( h(8) = 12 \\) and \\( 2j(4) = 12 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  \n- **Intersection Point:** \\( (4, 12) \\)\n\n**Check:**\n- Both \\( h(8) \\) and \\( 2j(4) \\) equal 12, confirming the intersection.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Focusing on specific points where the transformations align worked better than trying all given points.\n\n### **Step 5: Confirming the Intersection Point**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Ensure that \\( (4, 12) \\) is indeed on both graphs \\( y = h(2x) \\) and \\( y = 2j(x) \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **For \\( h(2x) \\):**\n  \n  - \\( x = 4 \\)\n  - \\( h(2 \\times 4) = h(8) = 12 \\)\n  \n- **For \\( 2j(x) \\):**\n  \n  - \\( j(4) = 6 \\)\n  - \\( 2j(4) = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\)\n  \n**Check:**\n- Both functions yield \\( y = 12 \\) at \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The point \\( (4, 12) \\) satisfies both equations, confirming the intersection.\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Sum of the Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The problem asks for the sum of the coordinates of the intersection point.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Intersection Point:** \\( (4, 12) \\)\n- **Sum:** \\( 4 + 12 = 16 \\)\n\n**Check:**\n- Simple addition confirms the sum.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The sum makes sense based on the coordinates.\n\n### **Step 7: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing, let's double-check the approach to ensure no steps were missed or incorrect assumptions made.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Substitution Approach:** Initially led to inconsistencies, but adjusting the strategy to focus on specific points worked.\n- **Intersection Verification:** Confirmed that \\( (4, 12) \\) satisfies both transformed equations.\n- **Sum Calculation:** Straightforward and correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The final answer aligns with the problem's requirements. The approach was adjusted based on feedback from earlier steps, leading to a correct solution.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe sum of the coordinates of the intersection point is **16**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy starting with a straightforward substitution strategy and adapting the approach upon encountering inconsistencies, I was able to identify the correct intersection point and calculate the desired sum. This step-by-step reflection and adjustment ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",
