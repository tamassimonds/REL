    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem just like I would if I were sitting down with it for the first time. I'll walk through my brainstorming, explore different strategies, reflect along the way, check my work often, and adjust my approach as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the question asks about the probability that at least two out of the six rolled dice show the same number. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving the **Birthday Paradox**, where you calculate the probability of shared birthdays. Maybe the same concept applies here with dice numbers.\n  \n- **Uncertainty:** I wonder if calculating directly the probability of at least two dice matching is straightforward. It seems like there could be a simpler method by considering the opposite scenario\u2014like not having any matches.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** \n  - **Direct Approach:** Calculate the probability of at least two dice showing the same number by considering all possible outcomes where this happens.\n  - **Indirect Approach:** Use the complement probability by first calculating the chance that all dice show different numbers and then subtracting that from 1.\n  - **Simulating or Listing:** Maybe list all combinations or use simulations, but that sounds messy and time-consuming.\n\n- **Decision:** The **complement approach** (calculating the probability that all dice show different numbers and subtracting from 1) seems more efficient. Let's try that first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Probability All Dice Show Different Numbers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf all six dice show different numbers, it means no two dice land on the same face (1 to 6). I need to calculate how many ways this can happen compared to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Total Possible Outcomes:** Each die has 6 sides, so:\n  \\[\n  6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 6^6 = 46,656\n  \\]\n  \n- **Favorable Outcomes (All Different):**\n  - For the **first die**, any of the 6 sides can show up: **6 ways**.\n  - For the **second die**, it can't match the first, so **5 ways**.\n  - For the **third die**, it can't match the first two, so **4 ways**.\n  - Continuing this pattern:\n    \\[\n    6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\n    \\]\n    \n- **Probability All Different:**\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{All different}) = \\frac{720}{46,656}\n  \\]\n  \n  Simplifying the fraction:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{720 \\div 144}{46,656 \\div 144} = \\frac{5}{324}\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** \n  \\[\n  \\frac{720}{46,656} \\approx 0.0154\n  \\]\n  Which seems reasonable for all dice showing different numbers out of many possible combinations.\n\n- **Reflection:** This approach makes sense. If it's rare for all dice to show different numbers, then the probability of at least two matching should be relatively higher.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Using the Complement Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, to find the probability that **at least two dice show the same number**, I need to subtract the probability that all dice show different numbers from 1.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{At least two same}) = 1 - P(\\text{All different}) = 1 - \\frac{5}{324}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{5}{324} = \\frac{324}{324} - \\frac{5}{324} = \\frac{319}{324}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Fraction Check:** \n  \\[\n  \\frac{319}{324} \\approx 0.985\n  \\]\n  This probability feels reasonable since it's highly likely that at least two dice will show the same number when rolling six dice.\n\n- **Consistency Check:** The complement method aligns intuitively because if it's rare for all dice to differ, then it's likely that at least one pair matches.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's verify if the complement probability method is correct. Maybe there's an easier or more intuitive way to confirm this.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Direct Calculation of Favorable Outcomes**\n\n- **Calculating the Probability of At Least Two Dice Matching:**\n  - Instead of using the complement, calculate directly the probability of having at least one pair.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Brainstorming:**\n  - This approach would involve considering all possible cases where at least two dice match.\n  - It's challenging to account for overlapping cases (e.g., three dice showing the same number), making direct calculation complex.\n\n- **Decision:** Given that the complement method provided a straightforward solution, and direct calculation seems cumbersome, I'll stick with the complement approach.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Reflection:** Trying to calculate directly would require handling multiple overlapping cases (e.g., two, three, or more dice matching), which complicates the process. The complement method is simpler and more efficient for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{319}{324}}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** The complement probability method effectively captured the unlikely scenario of all dice showing different numbers and provided a logical pathway to the correct probability.\n  \n- **Check Consistency:** The probability of \\(\\frac{319}{324} \\approx 0.985\\) indicates a very high likelihood that at least two dice will show the same number, which aligns with our expectations when rolling six dice.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The detailed step-by-step approach, along with continuous checking and reflection, confirms the correctness of the solution. Using the complement probability not only simplified the problem but also ensured an accurate and intuitive answer.",

  "ground_truth": "The only way in which there won't be two dice of the same number is if for each number between 1 and 6 there is exactly one die displaying that number. If we line the dice up, there are a total of $6!$ ways in which we could order 6 dice all displaying different numbers and a total of $6^6$ possible outcomes since each of the 6 dice can have 6 outcomes and all of the rolls are determined independently. That means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\\dfrac{6!}{6^6}=\\dfrac{5}{324}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\\dfrac{5}{324}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{319}{324}}$."
