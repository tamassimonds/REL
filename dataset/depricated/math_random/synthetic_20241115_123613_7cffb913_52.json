    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking my work often, and reflecting as needed\u2014just like a human would tackle a math problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n+1} + \\frac{2}{n+1} + \\frac{n}{n+1} = 3\n\\]\n\nthe immediate thing that stands out is the fractions with a common denominator of \\(n + 1\\). This reminds me of simplifying fractions or perhaps combining like terms. My initial thought is that it might involve merging these fractions somehow.\n\nBut then I wonder, is combining the fractions the right first step? Or should I look for another approach, like clearing the denominator or maybe analyzing the equation differently?\n\nLet me jot down a few brainstorming ideas:\n\n1. **Combine the Fractions:** Since they share the same denominator, maybe I can add the numerators together.\n   \n2. **Clear the Denominator:** Multiply both sides by \\(n + 1\\) to eliminate the fractions.\n\n3. **Isolate Terms:** Try to isolate \\(n\\) by moving terms around, perhaps simplify after clearing the denominator.\n\n4. **Check for Patterns:** Look for similarities to other problems, maybe it\u2019s a linear equation after simplification.\n\nI\u2019ll start with the first option: combining the fractions. If that doesn't work, I'll explore clearing the denominator.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempt to Combine the Fractions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens if I try to combine the fractions by adding their numerators since they all have the same denominator.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + 2 + n}{n+1} = 3\n\\]\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3 + n}{n + 1} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check: Does this seem right?**\n\nAt first glance, this looks like a reasonable step because adding fractions with a common denominator by combining numerators is a valid approach.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBut wait\u2014before jumping to solve it, let\u2019s think: Does this make the equation easier to solve? I remember that multiplying both sides by the denominator might also eliminate the fraction immediately, which could be cleaner.\n\nMaybe combining first isn\u2019t the best approach. Let\u2019s try clearing the denominator instead.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Clearing the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s multiply both sides by \\(n + 1\\) to eliminate the fraction from the equation entirely.\n\n\\[\n(n + 1) \\times \\frac{3 + n}{n + 1} = 3 \\times (n + 1)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3 + n = 3(n + 1)\n\\]\n\n**Check: Does this look correct?**\n\nNow the fractions are gone, and we have a linear equation to solve. This seems like a more straightforward path.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nClearing the denominator simplifies the problem significantly. Let me continue with this approach and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Expanding the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, let\u2019s expand the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n3 + n = 3(n + 1)\n\\]\n\nDistributing the 3:\n\n\\[\n3 + n = 3n + 3\n\\]\n\n**Check: Does this make sense?**\n\nSo far, so good. We have \\(n\\) on both sides, which is typical in linear equations. Next, let's get all the \\(n\\) terms on one side.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI remember that isolating \\(n\\) is essential. Let\u2019s move the \\(n\\) term on the left to the right side to combine like terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Isolating \\(n\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSubtract \\(n\\) from both sides to get all \\(n\\) terms on one side:\n\n\\[\n3 + n - n = 3n + 3 - n\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n3 = 2n + 3\n\\]\n\n**Check: Is this correct?**\n\nLooks right so far. Now, let's isolate \\(n\\) by moving 3 to the left side.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSimple subtraction should work here. Checking if moving 3 makes sense\u2014yes, it\u2019ll help isolate \\(n\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving for \\(n\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n3 - 3 = 2n + 3 - 3\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n0 = 2n\n\\]\n\n**Check: Does this result seem plausible?**\n\nWait, dividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\nn = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(n = 0\\). But let me double-check if this value satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, an \\(n\\) value of 0 is interesting. Before concluding, let\u2019s verify if it holds true in the original equation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nPlug \\(n = 0\\) back into the original equation to see if it satisfies:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{0+1} + \\frac{2}{0+1} + \\frac{0}{0+1} = 3\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{2}{1} + \\frac{0}{1} = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3\n\\]\n\nWhich equals 3.\n\n**Check: Does this match?**\n\nYes, both sides are equal. This confirms that \\(n = 0\\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe verification step is crucial. It reassures that the solution is valid and that there were no errors in the process.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Starting by considering different strategies helped identify the most efficient path\u2014clearing the denominator.\n  \n- **Exploring Strategies:** Attempting to combine fractions first was a good idea, but realized that multiplying both sides by \\(n + 1\\) simplified the equation more effectively.\n\n- **Reflection and Checking:** Constantly checking after each step ensured that the solution remained on track. Verifying the final answer confirmed its correctness.\n\n- **Human-like Approach:** Emulating a human problem-solver involved brainstorming, trying different methods, reflecting on their validity, and persistently checking for correctness, including verifying the final solution.\n\nBy following this detailed, step-by-step approach, we've successfully determined that:\n\n\\[\nn = 0\n\\]\n\nThis value satisfies the given equation, and the process ensures accuracy through continuous reflection and verification.",
