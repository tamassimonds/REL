I'll start by exploring various methods, checking each step for correctness, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x-1}{x-3} \\ge 2\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Fraction Inequality:** This reminds me of inequalities involving fractions I've seen before. I know that dealing with fractions can introduce critical points where the expression changes, like vertical asymptotes or zeros.\n- **Comparison to Constants:** The right side is a constant (2), which suggests I might compare the fractional expression to 2 directly.\n- **Potential Need for Common Denominator:** Maybe I need to get both sides over a common denominator to simplify the inequality.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Subtract 2 from both sides to set the inequality to zero.\n2. **Cross-Multiplication:** Since the denominator isn't zero in the range we're considering, maybe multiply both sides by \\(x - 3\\) to eliminate the fraction.\n3. **Graphical Approach:** Consider what the graph of the function looks like to identify solution intervals.\n4. **Test Points Method:** After finding critical points, test sample points in each interval to see where the inequality holds.\n\nAt this stage, I'm leaning towards **Algebraic Manipulation** followed by **Test Points Method** to verify. Let's see how that works out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Algebraic Manipulation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI remember that to solve inequalities involving fractions, it's often helpful to bring everything to one side. This can help in identifying critical points where the inequality might change.\n\n**Action:**\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x-1}{x-3} - 2 \\ge 0\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Expression:**\n\nWait, let me think about this... \n\n- Subtracting 2 means I need a common denominator with \\(x - 3\\).\n- So, I express 2 with the same denominator:\n\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{2(x - 3)}{x - 3} = \\frac{2x - 6}{x - 3}\n\\]\n\n**Now the Inequality Becomes:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x - 1 - (2x - 6)}{x - 3} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\n**Simplify the Numerator:**\n\n\\[\nx - 1 - 2x + 6 = -x + 5\n\\]\n\nSo, the inequality is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-x + 5}{x - 3} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat seems correct. By bringing both terms to a common denominator, I've unified the inequality. Now, I have a single fraction to analyze.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rewriting the Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo make it easier to solve, I can rewrite the inequality by factoring out a negative sign in the numerator. This might help in identifying the critical points and the behavior of the fraction.\n\n**Action:**\n\nFactor out -1 from the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-(x - 5)}{x - 3} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\n**Alternative Writing:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x - 5}{x - 3} \\le 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, I flipped the inequality when factoring out a negative. That\u2019s good because it aligns with standard practices for solving inequalities.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Critical Points**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find the points where the expression changes its sign. These are typically where the numerator is zero or the denominator is zero.\n\n**Action:**\n\n1. **Numerator Zero:**\n   \\[\n   x - 5 = 0 \\implies x = 5\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Denominator Zero:**\n   \\[\n   x - 3 = 0 \\implies x = 3\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, there are critical points at \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = 5\\). The point \\(x = 3\\) is particularly important because the denominator becomes zero, which could make the expression undefined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Creating a Number Line**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo analyze the sign of the expression, a number line will help visualize where the inequality holds.\n\n**Action:**\n\nDivide the number line at the critical points:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, 3),\\, (3, 5),\\, (5, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI need to remember that the expression is undefined at \\(x = 3\\). This means we can't include 3 in our solution. It's like a hole in the number line.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Testing Each Interval**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I'll pick test points from each interval to see if the inequality holds true.\n\n**Action:**\n\n1. **Interval \\((- \\infty, 3)\\):** Choose \\(x = 0\\)\n   \\[\n   \\frac{0 - 5}{0 - 3} = \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\ge 0\n   \\]\n   **Result:** True\n   \n2. **Interval \\((3, 5)\\):** Choose \\(x = 4\\)\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4 - 5}{4 - 3} = \\frac{-1}{1} = -1 \\le 0\n   \\]\n   **Result:** True\n\n3. **Interval \\((5, \\infty)\\):** Choose \\(x = 6\\)\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6 - 5}{6 - 3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\ge 0\n   \\]\n   **Result:** True\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, here\u2019s where I need to be careful. Both intervals \\((- \\infty, 3)\\) and \\((5, \\infty)\\) yield true, as well as \\((3, 5)\\). However, I must ensure the inequality is satisfied as less than or equal to zero, not just greater than. I think I need to reconsider the sign after factoring out the negative.\n\n**Wait, let me check...**\n\nWhen I factored out -1, the inequality flipped. This means the original inequality was \\(\\frac{x - 5}{x - 3} \\le 0\\), which matches my test results. So, the expression is non-positive in all three intervals except at \\(x = 3\\) where it's undefined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Constructing the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBased on the test results, it seems that the inequality holds in three intervals. However, I need to ensure that \\(x = 3\\) is excluded because the expression is undefined there.\n\n**Action:**\n\nThe solution set is:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, 3) \\cup (3, 5] \\cup (5, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense because:\n\n- In \\((-\\infty, 3)\\), the expression is positive.\n- In \\((3, 5)\\), the expression is negative or zero at \\(x = 5\\).\n- In \\((5, \\infty)\\), the expression is positive again.\n\n**But wait...**\n\nThe inequality requires the expression to be less than or equal to zero. So, I need to ensure that the intervals where the expression is negative or zero are included.\n\nLooking at the test results:\n\n- \\((-\\infty, 3)\\): Expression is positive (5/3).\n- \\((3, 5)\\): Expression is negative (-1).\n- \\((5, \\infty)\\): Expression is positive (1/3).\n\nTherefore, only \\((3, 5)\\) and \\(x = 5\\) should be part of the solution.\n\nWait...\n\nDoes that mean the solution is:\n\n\\[\n(3, 5]\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat doesn't seem right because in the interval \\((3, 5)\\), the expression is negative, which satisfies the inequality. But in the interval \\((5, \\infty)\\), the expression becomes positive, which doesn't satisfy \\(\\le 0\\).\n\n**Rechecking:**\n\nAhh, I see the mistake. The solution must only include where the expression is less than or equal to zero. This means:\n\n- **Include \\((3, 5)\\):** The expression is negative.\n- **Include \\(x = 5\\):** The expression is zero.\n- **Exclude \\((-\\infty, 3)\\):** The expression is positive.\n- **Exclude \\((5, \\infty)\\):** The expression is positive.\n\nBut in the original problem, the expression \\(\\frac{-x + 5}{x - 3}\\) was set to be greater than or equal to zero. Therefore, the solution should include where the expression is non-negative.\n\nLet me correct this:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Finalizing the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBased on the testing, the inequality \\(\\frac{x - 5}{x - 3} \\le 0\\) holds in the following intervals:\n\n1. **All \\(x < 3\\):** The expression is positive.\n2. **At \\(x = 3\\):** Undefined.\n3. **For \\(3 < x < 5\\):** The expression is negative.\n4. **At \\(x = 5\\):** The expression is zero.\n5. **For \\(x > 5\\):** The expression is positive.\n\nThus, the solution where the expression is less than or equal to zero is:\n\n\\[\n(3, 5]\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me double-check this. The expression is negative or zero only in the interval \\((3, 5]\\). Therefore, this is the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Solution**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(3, 5]}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Starting with algebraic manipulation was a good strategy, but it required careful handling of signs when factoring out negative terms.\n- **Testing Intervals:** This step was crucial in verifying where the inequality holds.\n- **Reflection and Correction:** Regularly checking each step helped catch the initial oversight about including or excluding certain intervals.\n- **Final Answer Check:** Ensuring that only \\(x\\) values where the expression is less than or equal to zero are included led to the correct solution.\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and being willing to correct mistakes, I arrived at the correct solution: \\(x \\in (3, 5]\\).",
