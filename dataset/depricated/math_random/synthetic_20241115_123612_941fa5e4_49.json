    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through each part as naturally as possible. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it on paper myself.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the function **\\( h(x) = \\frac{3x - 1}{\\sqrt{x - 5}} \\)**, my initial reaction is:\n\n1. **Square Root in the Denominator:** \n   - There's a square root in the denominator. That makes me think about restrictions on the domain. Square roots can only take non-negative values, right? So, \\( x - 5 \\) must be non-negative.\n\n2. **Numerator Doesn't Affect Domain:** \n   - The numerator \\( 3x - 1 \\) is a linear function, so it doesn't impose any additional restrictions on the domain by itself.\n\n3. **Potential for Division by Zero:** \n   - If \\( \\sqrt{x - 5} \\) is in the denominator, \\( x - 5 \\) cannot be zero. Otherwise, we'd be dividing by zero, which is undefined.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nTo find the domain, I need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative and that the denominator is not zero. Here are a few strategies I'm considering:\n\n1. **Set Up Inequalities:**\n   - Find where \\( x - 5 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( x - 5 \\neq 0 \\).\n\n2. **Analyze the Square Root:**\n   - Since the square root is in the denominator, determine the minimum value \\( x \\) can take.\n\n3. **Combine Conditions:**\n   - Merge the conditions to find the valid range for \\( x \\).\n\nI'm leaning towards starting with setting up the inequalities because it seems straightforward.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Inequality**\n\nLet's begin by ensuring the expression inside the square root is non-negative:\n\n\\[\nx - 5 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This inequality ensures that the square root is defined.\n- Solving it gives me the minimum value \\( x \\) can take.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx - 5 \\geq 0 \\implies x \\geq 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Okay, so \\( x \\) must be greater than or equal to 5 for the square root to be real.\n- But wait, there's more. Since the square root is in the denominator, \\( x - 5 \\) can't just be zero; otherwise, the denominator would be zero.\n\n### **Step 2: Addressing the Denominator**\n\nNow, let's ensure that the denominator is not zero:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x - 5} \\neq 0 \\implies x - 5 \\neq 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx - 5 \\neq 0 \\implies x \\neq 5\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- So, \\( x \\) must be greater than 5, not equal to 5.\n- This makes sense because if \\( x = 5 \\), the denominator becomes zero, which is undefined.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I can combine these two conditions: \\( x \\geq 5 \\) and \\( x \\neq 5 \\).\n- This simplifies to \\( x > 5 \\). But let me double-check:\n\n  - The inequality \\( x - 5 \\geq 0 \\) includes \\( x = 5 \\).\n  - However, since \\( x - 5 \\neq 0 \\), \\( x = 5 \\) is excluded.\n\n### **Step 3: Finalizing the Domain**\n\nCombining the conditions:\n\n\\[\nx > 5\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This means the function is defined for all \\( x \\) greater than 5.\n- It makes sense because only then is the denominator positive and defined.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Let me think about this for a moment: Does \\( x > 5 \\) cover all possible issues?\n- Yes, it ensures the square root is defined and the denominator is never zero.\n\n### **Step 4: Checking the Approach**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let's quickly verify if this makes sense:\n\n- **Square Root Defined:** \\( x - 5 \\geq 0 \\) \u21d2 \\( x \\geq 5 \\)\n- **Denominator Non-Zero:** \\( x - 5 \\neq 0 \\) \u21d2 \\( x \\neq 5 \\)\n- **Combined Condition:** \\( x > 5 \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Does \\( x > 5 \\) satisfy both conditions?\n- Yes, it ensures the square root is defined and the denominator is not zero.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I feel confident about this conclusion.\n- The domain is indeed \\( x > 5 \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Just to double-check, let's consider a sample value:\n  \n  - If \\( x = 6 \\):\n    \\[\n    h(6) = \\frac{3(6) - 1}{\\sqrt{6 - 5}} = \\frac{18 - 1}{1} = 17\n    \\]\n  \n  - Perfect! The function works at \\( x = 6 \\).\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Graphical Approach**\n\nWait, maybe there\u2019s another way to confirm this\u2014let's think about it.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Graph the Function:** \n  - Plotting \\( h(x) \\) could visually show the domain.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- By graphing, I can see where the function is defined.\n- This might help confirm that \\( x > 5 \\) is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- But wait, I don't have graphing tools here, and it's more time-consuming.\n- Let\u2019s stick with the algebraic approach since it\u2019s straightforward and confirms the domain.\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies and reflecting on each step, I\u2019m confident that the domain of \\( h(x) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(5, \\infty)}\n\\]\n\nThis means the function is defined for all real numbers greater than 5.",

  "ground_truth": "The square root $\\sqrt{x - 5}$ is defined only for $x \\ge 5.$  Moreoever, $\\sqrt{x - 5}$ is in the denominator of the fraction, so it cannot be 0, i.e. $x$ cannot be 5.  Therefore, the domain of the function is $\\boxed{(5,\\infty)}.$"
