Let's tackle this probability problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming as we go, just like a human would when faced with a new question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about rolling **two fair 6-sided dice** and finding the probability that **at least one of them shows a 1**.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems where we deal with probabilities involving multiple events. I've encountered dice probability problems before, but it's been a while. I think I need to consider different strategies to make sure I get it right.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure what the best approach is right away. Should I think about the total number of outcomes? Maybe consider the complementary probability? Let's explore different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List All Possible Outcomes:** \n   - **Thoughts:** There are two dice, each with 6 faces, so I could list all 36 possible combinations. But that feels a bit tedious.\n   - **Reflection:** Listing seems exhaustive but might help in visualizing the problem. Let me jot down a few ideas to see if it\u2019s worth pursuing.\n\n2. **Use Complementary Probability:**\n   - **Thoughts:** Instead of directly calculating the probability of getting at least one '1', I could calculate the probability of NOT getting a '1' on both dice and subtract it from 1.\n   - **Reflection:** This seems like a more efficient approach. Often, calculating the complement is easier in dice problems.\n\n3. **Probabilities of Each Die Individually:**\n   - **Thoughts:** Calculate the probability of each die showing a '1' and then consider the combined probability.\n   - **Reflection:** I need to be careful here because the events are not independent in the way I might initially think\u2014both dice are rolled together.\n\n4. **Simulation Method:**\n   - **Thoughts:** Although not practical for a step-by-step manual solution, simulating multiple rolls could provide an approximate answer.\n   - **Reflection:** This might be overkill for a simple probability question and doesn't align with the step-by-step approach we're aiming for.\n\n- **Deciding on Approach:** Given these options, the **complementary probability** method stands out as the most efficient and straightforward. But listing all outcomes could serve as a good sanity check.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Complementary Probability Method**\n\n**Idea:** Calculate the probability that **neither die shows a 1** and subtract this from 1.\n\n- **Total Outcomes:** Each die has 6 sides, so there are \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) total possible outcomes.\n  \n- **Favorable Outcomes for the Complement:** If neither die shows a '1', each die can land on any of the remaining 5 sides (2-6).\n  \n  So, the number of outcomes where **both dice are not '1':**\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 5 = 25\n  \\]\n  \n- **Probability of the Complement:**\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Both dice are not '1'}) = \\frac{25}{36}\n  \\]\n\n- **Probability of At Least One Die Showing a '1':**\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{At least one die shows '1'}) = 1 - P(\\text{Both dice are not '1'}) = 1 - \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{11}{36}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:** \n  - **Calculation:** \\(1 - \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{36}{36} - \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{11}{36}\\)\n  - **Thoughts:** This number makes sense. It's less than 1, which is good for a probability. Hmm, 11 out of 36 reduces nicely to about 30.56%. That seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying by Listing All Possible Outcomes**\n\n**Idea:** List all 36 outcomes and count those where at least one die shows a '1'.\n\n- **Total Outcomes:** There are \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) combinations (each die's roll is independent).\n\n- **Outcomes Where At Least One Die Shows '1':**\n  - **Die 1 Shows '1':**  \n    \\[\n    (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n    \\]\n    Total: 6 outcomes\n  \n  - **Die 2 Shows '1' (and Die 1 is not '1'):**  \n    \\[\n    (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n    \\]\n    Total: 5 outcomes (excluding \\( (1,1) \\) since it's already counted)\n  \n  - **Total Favorable Outcomes:**  \n    \\[\n    6 + 5 = 11\n    \\]\n  \n- **Probability:**\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{At least one die shows '1'}) = \\frac{11}{36}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - **Calculation:** Matches our previous result.\n  - **Thoughts:** Both methods agree, which is a good sign. It reinforces the correctness of the complementary probability approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering an Alternative Approach - Direct Calculation**\n\n**Idea:** Calculate the probability of each scenario where at least one die shows a '1'.\n\n- **Scenarios:**\n  1. **Die 1 Shows '1' and Die 2 Shows Any Number:**\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{Die 1 is '1'}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 6 = \\frac{1}{6}\n     \\]\n  \n  2. **Die 2 Shows '1' and Die 1 Shows Any Number (Excluding Die 1 = '1'):**\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{Die 2 is '1' and Die 1 is not '1'}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{5}{36}\n     \\]\n  \n  3. **Both Dice Show '1':**\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{Both dice are '1'}) = \\frac{1}{36}\n     \\]\n  \n- **Total Probability:**\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{At least one die shows '1'}) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{5}{36} + \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{6}{36} + \\frac{5}{36} + \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{11}{36}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - **Calculation:** Same as before.\n  - **Thoughts:** This method also yields \\(\\frac{11}{36}\\). It adds up the probabilities without double-counting, confirming the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Reflecting on the Approaches**\n\n- **Complementary Probability Method:** \n  - **Pros:** Direct and efficient. Avoids double-counting by considering the probability of the complementary event.\n  - **Cons:** Initially seemed less intuitive, but worked out well in the end.\n\n- **Direct Calculation Approach:** \n  - **Pros:** Straightforward, considers all scenarios individually.\n  - **Cons:** Slightly more cumbersome as it involved multiple steps, but still valid.\n\n- **Sanity Check:** Both methods converged to the same probability, which strengthens the confidence in the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n- **Correctness Check:** Multiple approaches led to the same probability: \\(\\frac{11}{36}\\). Given the consistency, the solution is likely correct.\n\n- **Reflection:** At first, I hesitated between listing all outcomes and using the complementary probability method. Listing helped visualize the problem, but the complementary method was more efficient. It\u2019s always good to have multiple strategies, especially to verify the answer.\n\n- **Learning Insight:** Complementary probability is a powerful tool in problems involving \"at least one\" scenarios. It can simplify calculations by focusing on the negative case.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The probability that **at least one die shows a 1** when rolling two fair 6-sided dice is \\(\\frac{11}{36}\\).\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and checking, mirrors a human\u2019s natural problem-solving process.

  "ground_truth": "There are 5 ways in which the first roll is not 1, and 5 ways in which the second roll is not 1, so there are $5 \\times 5 = 25$ ways in which neither die shows 1.  Therefore there are $36-25=11$ ways in which one or both dice show 1.  So the probability of this is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{36}}$."
