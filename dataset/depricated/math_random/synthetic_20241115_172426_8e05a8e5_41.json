The goal is to find the remainder when the product of three positive integers, which leave remainders of 1, 2, and 3 when divided by 5, is divided by 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Okay, so we have three positive integers.\n- When each is divided by 5, the remainders are 1, 2, and 3.\n- We need to find the remainder when their product is divided by 5.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This reminds me of problems involving modular arithmetic.\n- Maybe I can use properties of remainders to simplify the calculations.\n- I recall that the product of remainders can sometimes give us the desired remainder directly.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation:**\n   - Multiply the integers directly and then find the remainder.\n   - But wait, that might be cumbersome without knowing the exact numbers.\n\n2. **Using Modular Arithmetic:**\n   - Multiply the remainders and see what that gives modulo 5.\n   - This seems more straightforward.\n\n3. **Exploring Different Combinations:**\n   - Perhaps consider different sets of integers that fit the remainder conditions to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I think using modular arithmetic (Strategy 2) makes the most sense because it avoids dealing with large numbers directly.\n- Direct calculation (Strategy 1) might be impractical without specific integers.\n- Exploring different combinations (Strategy 3) could validate our approach but might be time-consuming.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- Let's proceed with **Using Modular Arithmetic** as our primary strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Modular Arithmetic**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I\u2019ll start by representing the three integers based on their remainders when divided by 5.\n- Then, I'll multiply these representations together.\n- Finally, I'll find the remainder of this product when divided by 5.\n\n**Defining the Integers:**\n\n- Let\u2019s say:\n  - \\( a \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod } 5) \\)\n  - \\( b \\equiv 2 \\ (\\text{mod } 5) \\)\n  - \\( c \\equiv 3 \\ (\\text{mod } 5) \\)\n\n**Multiplying the Remainders:**\n\n- So, the product \\( a \\times b \\times c \\) can be expressed as:\n  \\[\n  a \\times b \\times c \\equiv 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\ (\\text{mod } 5)\n  \\]\n\n**Calculating the Product:**\n\n- Multiply the remainders:\n  \\[\n  1 \\times 2 = 2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 3 = 6\n  \\]\n\n**Finding the Remainder Modulo 5:**\n\n- Now, divide 6 by 5 to find the remainder:\n  \\[\n  6 \\div 5 = 1 \\ \\text{remainder} \\ 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  6 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod } 5)\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, that seems straightforward.** By multiplying the remainders directly, I got 6, which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5.\n- **Does this make sense?** Let me check if this aligns with the properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Approach with an Example**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To ensure our method is correct, let's validate it using specific integers that fit the remainder conditions.\n- This will help confirm that multiplying the remainders directly gives the correct result.\n\n**Selecting Specific Integers:**\n\n- Choose integers that satisfy the given remainders:\n  - \\( a = 6 \\) (since \\( 6 \\div 5 = 1 \\ \\text{remainder} \\ 1 \\))\n  - \\( b = 12 \\) (since \\( 12 \\div 5 = 2 \\ \\text{remainder} \\ 2 \\))\n  - \\( c = 18 \\) (since \\( 18 \\div 5 = 3 \\ \\text{remainder} \\ 3 \\))\n\n**Calculating the Product:**\n\n- Multiply these integers:\n  \\[\n  6 \\times 12 \\times 18 = 1296\n  \\]\n\n**Finding the Remainder When Divided by 5:**\n\n- Now, divide 1296 by 5:\n  \\[\n  1296 \\div 5 = 259 \\ \\text{remainder} \\ 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  1296 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod } 5)\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Aha!** The remainder is indeed 1, which matches our earlier calculation using modular arithmetic.\n- **This confirms that our approach is correct.** Multiplying the remainders directly works as expected.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring an Alternative Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Although the direct multiplication of remainders gave the correct answer, let's consider another method to ensure robustness.\n- Perhaps using the properties of modular equivalence could offer a different perspective.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\n- Recall that if \\( a \\equiv r_a \\ (\\text{mod } m) \\), \\( b \\equiv r_b \\ (\\text{mod } m) \\), and \\( c \\equiv r_c \\ (\\text{mod } m) \\), then:\n  \\[\n  a \\times b \\times c \\equiv r_a \\times r_b \\times r_c \\ (\\text{mod } m)\n  \\]\n  \n- In our case:\n  \\[\n  1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\equiv 6 \\ (\\text{mod } 5)\n  \\]\n  \n- And we\u2019ve already established that:\n  \\[\n  6 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod } 5)\n  \\]\n\n**Checking Consistency:**\n\n- **Does this align with our previous result?** Yes, it does.\n- **Is there any discrepancy?** No, the remainder remains consistent across both methods.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This reinforces our initial approach.** Using modular arithmetic directly is efficient and yields the correct remainder.\n- **Alternative strategies confirm the validity.** It's always good to check using different methods to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Everything Makes Sense**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's summarize the steps and verify that each part leads logically to the final answer.\n- This will help catch any potential mistakes or misunderstandings.\n\n**Recap of Steps:**\n\n1. **Defined the Integers:**\n   - \\( a \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod } 5) \\)\n   - \\( b \\equiv 2 \\ (\\text{mod } 5) \\)\n   - \\( c \\equiv 3 \\ (\\text{mod } 5) \\)\n\n2. **Applied Modular Arithmetic:**\n   - Multiplied the remainders: \\( 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n   - Found the remainder: \\( 6 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod } 5) \\)\n\n3. **Verified with Specific Examples:**\n   - Used specific integers to calculate the product and confirmed the remainder is 1.\n\n4. **Explored Alternative Strategy:**\n   - Reaffirmed that the product of the remainders gives the correct result using modular properties.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Everything checks out.** The remainder when the product of the integers is divided by 5 is consistently 1 across different methods.\n- **Is there anything more to consider?** Not really. The problem is straightforward once the right approach is identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming various strategies and verifying with specific examples, I conclude that the remainder when the product of the three integers (each leaving remainders of 1, 2, and 3 when divided by 5) is divided by 5 is **1**.",
