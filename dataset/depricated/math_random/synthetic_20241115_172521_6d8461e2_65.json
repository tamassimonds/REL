I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem **Compute \\(\\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3^4}\\)**, my immediate reaction is to break it down. It looks like I'm dealing with exponents and square roots, which reminds me of properties of exponents and roots I've encountered before.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Properties of Exponents:** Maybe I can simplify the expression inside the square root by using exponent rules.\n- **Square Root of a Product:** I recall that \\(\\sqrt{a \\cdot b} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\). Perhaps I can apply this property.\n- **Simplifying Exponents First:** Simplifying \\(2^2\\) and \\(3^4\\) individually before taking the square root might be a straightforward approach.\n\nBut to be thorough, let\u2019s explore each strategy and see which one works best.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Simplify Inside the Square Root First**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Start by simplifying \\(2^2\\) and \\(3^4\\) individually, then multiply the results before taking the square root.\n- **Calculation Steps:**\n  - \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n  - \\(3^4 = 81\\)\n  - Multiply them: \\(4 \\times 81 = 324\\)\n  - Then, find \\(\\sqrt{324}\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Wait, multiplying \\(4\\) and \\(81\\) gives \\(324\\). Is that easy to square root?\n- **Realization:** Yes, because \\(18 \\times 18 = 324\\). So, \\(\\sqrt{324} = 18\\).\n\n**Does this seem correct?**\n- Yes, because 18 multiplied by itself gives 324.\n\n**Strategy 2: Use the Square Root Property for Exponents**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Instead of simplifying inside the square root, apply the property \\(\\sqrt{a^n} = a^{n/2}\\) directly to each exponent.\n- **Calculation Steps:**\n  - Apply to \\(2^2\\): \\(\\sqrt{2^2} = 2^{2/2} = 2^1 = 2\\)\n  - Apply to \\(3^4\\): \\(\\sqrt{3^4} = 3^{4/2} = 3^2 = 9\\)\n  - Multiply the results: \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Both methods give me the same result, \\(18\\). This seems consistent.\n- **Realization:** This strategy is more efficient because it avoids multiplying large numbers unnecessarily.\n\n**Strategy 3: Factor the Expression Using Both Exponents and Roots**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Factor the expression into smaller parts using exponent and square root properties.\n- **Calculation Steps:**\n  - Break it down: \\(\\sqrt{(2^2) \\cdot (3^4)} = \\sqrt{2^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3^4}\\)\n  - Simplify each part:\n    - \\(\\sqrt{2^2} = 2\\)\n    - \\(\\sqrt{3^4} = 9\\)\n  - Multiply the simplified results: \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Again, I arrive at \\(18\\). This aligns with both previous strategies.\n- **Realization:** By separating the exponents and applying square root properties individually, I confirm the accuracy without dealing with larger numbers initially.\n\n### **Checking the Work: Is 18 Correct?**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Let\u2019s verify if squaring \\(18\\) indeed gives back the original expression under the square root.\n- **Calculation:**\n  - \\(18^2 = 324\\)\n  - Original expression: \\(2^2 \\times 3^4 = 4 \\times 81 = 324\\)\n\n**Does the check make sense?**\n- **Answer:** Yes, both approaches lead to \\(18\\), and squaring \\(18\\) returns to the original number under the square root, \\(324\\). This confirms the correctness.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Hesitation:** At first, I considered simplifying the entire expression inside the square root, but opted for applying square root properties directly to exponents after realizing it might be more straightforward.\n- **Mistake Check:** I double-checked each step, ensuring that exponent rules and square root properties were applied correctly.\n- **Alternate Strategy Insight:** While multiplying \\(4\\) and \\(81\\) directly worked, it was more efficient to handle exponents and roots separately, avoiding large-number calculations initially.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Final Answer:** \\(\\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = 18\\)\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the work, I confidently arrive at the correct solution. This approach ensures that even if one method seems complicated, there\u2019s always an alternative path to the right answer.",
