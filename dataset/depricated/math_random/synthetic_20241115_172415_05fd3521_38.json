    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, thinking through each part just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\n**User Query:**  \nFind \\[\\left|\\left(\\frac 35+\\frac 45i\\right)^6\\right|\\]\n\n**First Impressions:**  \n- **Absolute Value:** I see the absolute value (magnitude) of a complex number being raised to the sixth power. This reminds me of properties of complex numbers, especially involving magnitudes and powers.\n- **Complex Number:** The expression inside the absolute value is a complex number: \\(\\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{4}{5}i\\).\n- **Magnitude:** I recall that for any complex number \\(z = a + bi\\), the magnitude \\(|z|\\) is \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Direct Calculation of Magnitude:** \n   - Calculate the magnitude of \\(\\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{4}{5}i\\) and then raise that to the sixth power.\n  \n2. **De Moivre's Theorem:** \n   - Express the complex number in polar form and use De Moivre's theorem to simplify raising it to a power.\n  \n3. **Binomial Theorem:** \n   - Expand \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{4}{5}i\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and then find the magnitude.\n\n**Reflecting on Strategies:**\n- **Direct Calculation:** Seems straightforward. Calculate magnitude, then raise it to the sixth power.\n- **De Moivre's Theorem:** Might be more elegant, especially for higher powers like six, but requires converting to polar form.\n- **Binomial Theorem:** Expanding such a high power would be tedious, and we're only interested in the magnitude. This might not be the best approach.\n\n**Decision:**  \nI think the **Direct Calculation of Magnitude** is the most straightforward and least error-prone method for this particular problem. Let's try that first.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Magnitude of the Complex Number**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo find the magnitude \\(|z|\\) of the complex number \\(z = \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{4}{5}i\\), I recall that:\n\n\\[\n|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Real part \\(a = \\frac{3}{5}\\)\n- Imaginary part \\(b = \\frac{4}{5}\\)\n\n\\[\n|z| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{25} + \\frac{16}{25}}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{25}}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{1}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute\u2014The magnitude of the complex number is **1**. This feels significant because raising a number with an absolute value of 1 to any power should still have an absolute value of 1. Let's see if this holds true as we progress.\n\n### **Step 2: Raise the Magnitude to the Sixth Power**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince \\(|z| = 1\\), raising it to any power should still yield 1. But let's proceed to confirm by calculating \\(|z|^6\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n|z|^6 = 1^6 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**  \nThis aligns with the property of magnitudes for complex numbers. Magnitudes of unit complex numbers (those with a magnitude of 1) remain 1 regardless of the power.\n\n### **Step 3: Verification Using De Moivre's Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo ensure correctness, let's apply De Moivre's theorem, which states that for a complex number in polar form:\n\n\\[\n(z = r(\\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta))^n = r^n (\\cos n\\theta + i \\sin n\\theta)\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(r = |z| = 1\\), the theorem simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nz^n = (\\cos n\\theta + i \\sin n\\theta)\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(|z^n| = |z|^n = 1^6 = 1\\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- Convert \\(z\\) to polar form:\n  - \\(r = 1\\)\n  - \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{b}{a}) = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{4/5}{3/5}) = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{4}{3})\\)\n  \n- Applying De Moivre's theorem:\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{4}{5}i\\right)^6 = (\\cos(6 \\times \\theta) + i \\sin(6 \\times \\theta))\n  \\]\n  \n- But since \\(|z| = 1\\):\n  \\[\n  |z^6| = 1\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth methods confirm that the magnitude is **1**. This consistency reassures me that the approach is correct.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy directly calculating the magnitude of the complex number and raising it to the sixth power, we found that the absolute value is **1**. Verifying with De Moivre's theorem further solidified the correctness of the solution.\n\nThroughout the process, checking each step ensured that the approach was valid and the calculations were accurate. Reflecting on different strategies helped in selecting the most straightforward method, leading to a clear and concise solution.",
