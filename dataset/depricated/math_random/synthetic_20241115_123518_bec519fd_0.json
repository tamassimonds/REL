    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way, just like I would if I were tackling this on my own. The goal is to think through it thoroughly, make sure I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nOkay, the problem is about George receiving change less than one dollar. He needs to get the most quarters possible, and if there's a remainder, he gets it in pennies. Similarly, if he receives the most dimes possible, the leftover amount is in pennies too. The specific details are:\n\n- **When using quarters:** He needs 3 pennies to make up the total.\n- **When using dimes:** He needs 8 pennies to make up the total.\n\n**Initial Reflection:**  \nThis sounds like a problem involving modular arithmetic or equations relating to coin values. The fact that George needs a specific number of pennies after using either quarters or dimes suggests a relationship between the total amount and these coin denominations.\n\n**Aha Moment:**  \nMaybe the total amount can be expressed in terms of quarters and dimes, and the remainders (in pennies) help define those relationships.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n\n1. **Equation System:**  \n   Set up equations based on the conditions provided for quarters and dimes.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic:**  \n   Use modulo operations to see how the total amount interacts with 25 cents (quarters) and 10 cents (dimes).\n\n3. **Trial and Error:**  \n   Start with some plausible amounts less than a dollar and check if they satisfy both conditions.\n\n4. **Graphical Representation:**  \n   Though less common for a simpler problem like this, plotting might help visualize the relationship between different coin combinations.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe Equation System approach seems straightforward. However, I'm also considering modular arithmetic, especially since the problem mentions specific remainders in pennies. Let's start with setting up equations and see if that leads us to a solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's define the total amount George is supposed to receive as \\( T \\) cents. We'll express \\( T \\) in terms of the coins used and their respective remainders.\n\n1. **Using Quarters:**\n   - Quarters are worth 25 cents each.\n   - If he uses the maximum number of quarters, the remainder is 3 pennies.\n   - So, \\( T - 25q = 3 \\), where \\( q \\) is the number of quarters used.\n\n2. **Using Dimes:**\n   - Dimes are worth 10 cents each.\n   - With the maximum number of dimes, the remainder is 8 pennies.\n   - Thus, \\( T - 10d = 8 \\), where \\( d \\) is the number of dimes used.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow, we have two equations:\n\n\\[\nT - 25q = 3 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\\[\nT - 10d = 8 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\nI can already see that both equations equal \\( T \\), so let's set them equal to each other.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Equating the Two Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince both equations equal \\( T \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\[\n25q + 3 = 10d + 8\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n25q + 3 - 8 = 10d \\implies 25q - 10d = 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5q - 2d = 1 \\quad \\text{(3)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis new equation (3) relates the number of quarters and dimes used. It\u2019s a linear Diophantine equation. We can look for integer solutions where both \\( q \\) and \\( d \\) are non-negative integers.\n\n**Wait a Minute:**  \nSince we're dealing with physical coins, \\( q \\) and \\( d \\) must be whole numbers. This equation should have integer solutions that make sense in the context of the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Diophantine Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe need to find non-negative integer solutions for the equation:\n\n\\[\n5q - 2d = 1\n\\]\n\n**Finding a Particular Solution:**\n\nLet's try to find a specific solution by guessing and checking:\n\n- **Assume \\( q = 1 \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  5(1) - 2d = 1 \\implies 5 - 2d = 1 \\implies 2d = 4 \\implies d = 2\n  \\]\n  \n  **Solution:** \\( q = 1, d = 2 \\)\n\n**Checking the Solution:**\n\n- **Using Equation (1):**\n  \n  \\[\n  T - 25(1) = 3 \\implies T - 25 = 3 \\implies T = 28\n  \\]\n\n- **Using Equation (2):**\n  \n  \\[\n  T - 10(2) = 8 \\implies T - 20 = 8 \\implies T = 28\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nBoth equations give us \\( T = 28 \\) cents. This solution seems valid. However, to ensure there are no other possible amounts, let's see if there are other integer solutions by exploring different values of \\( q \\) and \\( d \\).\n\n**Exploring More Solutions:**\n\nSince this is a linear Diophantine equation, multiple solutions exist. The general solution can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n(q, d) = (1 + 2k, 2 + 5k) \\quad \\text{where } k \\text{ is an integer}\n\\]\n\n**Ensuring Non-Negative Solutions:**\n\nWe need \\( q \\geq 0 \\) and \\( d \\geq 0 \\):\n\n- **From \\( q = 1 + 2k \\geq 0 \\):**\n  \n  - \\( k \\geq -0.5 \\) \u2192 Since \\( k \\) must be an integer, \\( k \\geq 0 \\)\n\n- **From \\( d = 2 + 5k \\geq 0 \\):**\n  \n  - \\( k \\geq -0.4 \\) \u2192 But \\( k \\) must be an integer, so \\( k \\geq 0 \\)\n\n**Valid Solutions:**\n\nFor \\( k = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n(q, d) = (1, 2)\n\\]\n\nFor \\( k = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n(q, d) = (3, 7)\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( T \\) for \\( k = 1 \\):\n\n- **Using Equation (1):**\n  \n  \\[\n  T - 25(3) = 3 \\implies T - 75 = 3 \\implies T = 78\n  \\]\n  \n- **Using Equation (2):**\n  \n  \\[\n  T - 10(7) = 8 \\implies T - 70 = 8 \\implies T = 78\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nBoth solutions (\\( T = 28 \\) cents and \\( T = 78 \\) cents) satisfy the original conditions. I\u2019ll list these amounts and then check if there's any other possible amount by considering negative values of \\( k \\).\n\n**Checking for Negative \\( k \\):**\n\n- **For \\( k = -1 \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n(q, d) = (1 - 2, 2 - 5) = (-1, -3)\n\t\\]\n\t\n\t**Wait a Minute:**  \n\tNegative numbers don't make sense in this context since George can't have negative quarters or dimes. So, we disregard this solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe only valid amounts are \\( 28 \\) cents and \\( 78 \\) cents.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, let's make sure these amounts satisfy both conditions:\n\n1. **For \\( T = 28 \\) cents:**\n   - **Using Quarters:**\n   \n     \\[\n     28 - 25(1) = 3 \\quad (\\text{Matches the condition})\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Using Dimes:**\n   \n     \\[\n     28 - 10(2) = 8 \\quad (\\text{Matches the condition})\n     \\]\n     \n2. **For \\( T = 78 \\) cents:**\n   - **Using Quarters:**\n   \n     \\[\n     78 - 25(3) = 3 \\quad (\\text{Matches the condition})\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Using Dimes:**\n   \n     \\[\n     78 - 10(7) = 8 \\quad (\\text{Matches the condition})\n     \\]\n     \n**Reflection:**  \nBoth amounts satisfy the conditions set by the problem. Therefore, they're both valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Calculating the Sum of Possible Amounts**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe question asks for the sum, in cents, of the possible amounts of change George could receive. We've identified two possible amounts: \\( 28 \\) cents and \\( 78 \\) cents.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n28 + 78 = 106\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe sum is \\( 106 \\) cents, which makes sense given the two valid amounts we've found.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s briefly review the steps to ensure everything aligns:\n\n1. **Equations Setup:**  \n   - Based on the conditions for quarters and dimes.\n\n2. **Solving the Diophantine Equation:**  \n   - Found integer solutions that fit the real-world context.\n\n3. **Verification:**  \n   - Both solutions satisfy the original conditions.\n\n4. **Sum Calculation:**  \n   - Added the valid amounts to get the final answer.\n\n**Check:**  \nEverything seems correct. The approach was methodical, and the solutions were verified against the problem's conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{106}\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the possible amounts of change that George is trying to get is **106 cents**.",

  "ground_truth": "An amount in quarters is 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents. If George still needs 3 pennies, then the possible amounts of change he needs are 3, 28, 53, or 78 cents. With dimes, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 is 8. So the only possible amounts George could be getting are 28 cents or 78 cents, which add up to $\\boxed{106}$ cents."
