    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work regularly, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014similar to how I would tackle it naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n\\[\n(5x^2 - 6x + 7)(4x^2 + tx + 10) = 20x^4 - 54x^3 + 114x^2 - 102x + 70\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This reminds me of polynomial multiplication, probably using the **FOIL** method (First, Outside, Inside, Last) or the **distributive property** to expand the left-hand side.\n- The goal is to find the constant \\( t \\) that makes this equation true. So, it seems like \\( t \\) is a coefficient that aligns the expanded form with the given polynomial on the right-hand side.\n- My first instinct is to expand both sides and compare coefficients. That should help me pinpoint the value of \\( t \\).\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Expand Everything:** Multiply both polynomials completely and then match coefficients.\n2. **Match Leading Coefficients First:** Since the leading term is \\( 20x^4 \\), focus on matching that to simplify finding \\( t \\).\n3. **Use Synthetic/Polynomial Division:** Maybe divide the right side by the left's leading term to find \\( t \\)\u2014but that feels a bit advanced for this setup.\n4. **Check for Patterns:** Look for symmetry or patterns in the coefficients to make educated guesses.\n\n**First Approach:**\nLet's start by fully expanding the left-hand side. If that gets too messy or doesn't yield \\( t \\) directly, I'll rethink and try another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expand the Left-Hand Side Using FOIL**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Use the distributive property (or FOIL) to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n- This should give me a polynomial where I can match coefficients with the right-hand side.\n\n**Let's do the expansion:**\n\n\\[\n(5x^2 - 6x + 7)(4x^2 + tx + 10)\n\\]\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. **First Terms:** \\( 5x^2 \\times 4x^2 = 20x^4 \\)\n2. **Outside Terms:** \n   - \\( 5x^2 \\times tx = 5tx^3 \\)\n   - \\( -6x \\times 4x^2 = -24x^3 \\)\n3. **Inside Terms:** \n   - \\( -6x \\times tx = -6tx^2 \\)\n   - \\( 7 \\times 4x^2 = 28x^2 \\)\n4. **Last Terms:** \n   - \\( 7 \\times tx = 7tx \\)\n   - \\( -6x \\times 10 = -60x \\)\n   - \\( 7 \\times 10 = 70 \\)\n\n**Combining Like Terms:**\n\n\\[\n20x^4 + (5tx^3 - 24x^3) + (-6tx^2 + 28x^2) + (7tx - 60x) + 70\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 20x^4 + (5t - 24)x^3 + (-6t + 28)x^2 + (7t - 60)x + 70\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This expansion looks straightforward.\n- I can now directly compare coefficients with the right-hand side to find \\( t \\).\n- Before proceeding, let me quickly check the leading coefficient: \\( 20x^4 \\) on both sides matches\u2014good. That gives me confidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Match Coefficients for Each Power of \\( x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find \\( t \\), I'll set up equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\) from both sides.\n- Start with the \\( x^4 \\) term, then move to \\( x^3 \\), and so on.\n\n**Matching Coefficients:**\n\n1. **\\( x^4 \\) Term:**\n   \\[\n   20 = 20 \\quad \\text{(Already matches)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **\\( x^3 \\) Term:**\n   \\[\n   5t - 24 = -54\n   \\]\n   \n3. **\\( x^2 \\) Term:**\n   \\[\n   -6t + 28 = 114\n   \\]\n   \n4. **\\( x \\) Term:**\n   \\[\n   7t - 60 = -102\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Constant Term:**\n   \\[\n   70 = 70 \\quad \\text{(Already matches)}\n   \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- The \\( x^4 \\) and constant terms are already matching, so no issues there.\n- I have three equations involving \\( t \\). Ideally, they should all give the same \\( t \\) value if correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solve for \\( t \\) Using the \\( x^3 \\) and \\( x^2 \\) Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since I have multiple equations, I can use any two to solve for \\( t \\). This helps verify the correctness.\n- Let's solve the \\( x^3 \\) and \\( x^2 \\) equations.\n\n**Solving \\( x^3 \\) Equation:**\n\n\\[\n5t - 24 = -54\n\\]\n\nAdd 24 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n5t = -54 + 24\n\\]\n\\[\n5t = -30\n\\]\n\nDivide by 5:\n\n\\[\nt = -6\n\\]\n\n**Solving \\( x^2 \\) Equation:**\n\n\\[\n-6t + 28 = 114\n\\]\n\nSubtract 28 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-6t = 114 - 28\n\\]\n\\[\n-6t = 86\n\\]\n\nDivide by -6:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{-86}{6} = -\\frac{43}{3} \\approx -14.33\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait a second. We have two different values for \\( t \\): \\( -6 \\) and \\( -\\frac{43}{3} \\).\n- This inconsistency suggests something's off. Perhaps there's a mistake in the expansion or the matching process.\n- To resolve this, I'll double-check my expansion and ensure the coefficients were matched correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Double-Check the Expansion and Coefficient Matching**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- It's crucial to verify that the expansion was done correctly and that the coefficients were matched accurately.\n- Let's revisit the expansion step and ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n**Re-examining the Expansion:**\n\n\\[\n(5x^2 - 6x + 7)(4x^2 + tx + 10)\n\\]\n\n1. **First Terms:** \n   \\[\n   5x^2 \\times 4x^2 = 20x^4\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Outside Terms:** \n   \\[\n   5x^2 \\times tx = 5tx^3\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   -6x \\times 4x^2 = -24x^3\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Inside Terms:** \n   \\[\n   -6x \\times tx = -6tx^2\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   7 \\times 4x^2 = 28x^2\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Last Terms:** \n   \\[\n   7 \\times tx = 7tx\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   -6x \\times 10 = -60x\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   7 \\times 10 = 70\n   \\]\n\n**Combining Like Terms Again:**\n\n\\[\n20x^4 + (5tx^3 - 24x^3) + (-6tx^2 + 28x^2) + (7tx - 60x) + 70\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 20x^4 + (5t - 24)x^3 + (-6t + 28)x^2 + (7t - 60)x + 70\n\\]\n\n**Coefficient Matching:**\n\n1. **\\( x^4 \\):** \n   \\[\n   20 = 20 \\quad \\text{(Matches)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **\\( x^3 \\):** \n   \\[\n   5t - 24 = -54\n   \\]\n   \n3. **\\( x^2 \\):** \n   \\[\n   -6t + 28 = 114\n   \\]\n   \n4. **\\( x \\):** \n   \\[\n   7t - 60 = -102\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Constant:** \n   \\[\n   70 = 70 \\quad \\text{(Matches)}\n   \\]\n\n**Resolving the Inconsistency:**\n- Let's focus on one equation to ensure correctness. I'll use the \\( x^3 \\) equation.\n\n\\[\n5t - 24 = -54\n\\]\n\nAdd 24 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n5t = -30\n\\]\n\nDivide by 5:\n\n\\[\nt = -6\n\\]\n\n**Second Check:**\n- Now, let's see if \\( t = -6 \\) satisfies the other equations.\n\n**Testing \\( t = -6 \\) in the \\( x^2 \\) Equation:**\n\n\\[\n-6(-6) + 28 = 36 + 28 = 64 \\quad \\text{(But expected 114)}\n\\]\n\n**Observation:**\n- There's a mismatch. The \\( x^2 \\) equation doesn't hold true for \\( t = -6 \\).\n- This discrepancy indicates that I might have made an error in the expansion or coefficient matching.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying the Error and Seeking a Different Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since matching coefficients led to conflicting values for \\( t \\), it's time to reconsider the expansion or try a different method.\n- Perhaps expanding completely was too cumbersome. Maybe matching leading coefficients first would streamline the process.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n- **Match Leading Coefficients:** Focus on the \\( x^4 \\) term to determine a relationship involving \\( t \\).\n- **Simplify the Problem:** See if there's a way to reduce the number of equations needed to find \\( t \\).\n\n**Let's Revisit the Leading Coefficient Match:**\n\nThe leading term from both sides is \\( 20x^4 \\).\n\n\\[\n5x^2 \\times 4x^2 = 20x^4\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- This coefficient matches perfectly, indicating that the leading term multiplication is correct.\n- Since the leading coefficients match, \\( t \\) doesn't affect the \\( x^4 \\) term, which simplifies the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Simplifying by Focusing on the \\( x^3 \\) Term**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's focus solely on the \\( x^3 \\) term to solve for \\( t \\).\n- If \\( t = -6 \\) doesn't work for all terms, perhaps there's a mistake in how the terms were combined.\n\n**Focusing on the \\( x^3 \\) Term:**\n\nThe \\( x^3 \\) terms from the expansion are:\n\n\\[\n5t x^3 - 24x^3 = (5t - 24)x^3\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to the \\( x^3 \\) term on the right side:\n\n\\[\n5t - 24 = -54\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( t \\):**\n\nAdd 24 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n5t = -54 + 24\n\\]\n\\[\n5t = -30\n\\]\n\nDivide by 5:\n\n\\[\nt = -6\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- If \\( t = -6 \\), let's see if it fits the other equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying \\( t = -6 \\) with the \\( x^2 \\) and \\( x \\) Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Although \\( t = -6 \\) works for the \\( x^3 \\) term, we must verify if it also satisfies the \\( x^2 \\) and \\( x \\) terms.\n\n**Checking the \\( x^2 \\) Term:**\n\n\\[\n-6t + 28 = 114\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( t = -6 \\):\n\n\\[\n-6(-6) + 28 = 36 + 28 = 64 \\quad \\text{(But expected 114)}\n\\]\n\n**Observation:**\n- There's a mismatch again. The \\( x^2 \\) equation doesn't hold for \\( t = -6 \\).\n- This suggests that while \\( t = -6 \\) satisfies the \\( x^3 \\) term, it doesn't satisfy the other terms, implying a potential error in the initial approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Reflecting on the Approach and Seeking Clarity**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Given that \\( t = -6 \\) only partially satisfies the equations, I need to reconsider the expansion process to ensure correctness.\n- Perhaps there was a mistake in how the terms were combined or coefficients were matched.\n\n**Reflecting on the Expansion:**\n- Let's re-examine the steps to ensure no term was overlooked or miscalculated.\n\n**Re-examining the Expansion Steps:**\n\n\\[\n(5x^2 - 6x + 7)(4x^2 + tx + 10)\n\\]\n\n1. **First Terms:** \n   \\[\n   5x^2 \\times 4x^2 = 20x^4\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Outside Terms:**\n   - \\( 5x^2 \\times tx = 5tx^3 \\)\n   - \\( -6x \\times 4x^2 = -24x^3 \\)\n   \n3. **Inside Terms:**\n   - \\( -6x \\times tx = -6tx^2 \\)\n   - \\( 7 \\times 4x^2 = 28x^2 \\)\n   \n4. **Last Terms:**\n   - \\( 7 \\times tx = 7tx \\)\n   - \\( -6x \\times 10 = -60x \\)\n   - \\( 7 \\times 10 = 70 \\)\n\n**Combining Like Terms:**\n\n\\[\n20x^4 + (5t - 24)x^3 + (-6t + 28)x^2 + (7t - 60)x + 70\n\\]\n\n**Matching Coefficients Again:**\n\n1. **\\( x^4 \\):** \n   \\[\n   20 = 20 \\quad \\text{(Matches)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **\\( x^3 \\):** \n   \\[\n   5t - 24 = -54\n   \\]\n   \n   Solving:\n   \\[\n   5t = -54 + 24 = -30 \\implies t = -6\n   \\]\n   \n3. **\\( x^2 \\):** \n   \\[\n   -6t + 28 = 114\n   \\]\n   \n   Substituting \\( t = -6 \\):\n   \\[\n   -6(-6) + 28 = 36 + 28 = 64 \\quad \\text{(But expected 114)}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **\\( x \\):** \n   \\[\n   7t - 60 = -102\n   \\]\n   \n   Substituting \\( t = -6 \\):\n   \\[\n   7(-6) - 60 = -42 - 60 = -102 \\quad \\text{(Matches)}\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Constant:** \n   \\[\n   70 = 70 \\quad \\text{(Matches)}\n   \\]\n\n**New Insight:**\n- The \\( x^2 \\) term doesn't match when \\( t = -6 \\), but the \\( x \\) term does.\n- This inconsistency suggests that there might be a mistake in how the terms were combined or perhaps an assumption that doesn't hold.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Alternative Strategy - Expand One Term at a Time**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To ensure no errors, let's expand the polynomials one step at a time, carefully tracking each term.\n\n**Expanding Step by Step:**\n\n1. **Expand \\( (5x^2 - 6x + 7) \\) with \\( 4x^2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   5x^2 \\times 4x^2 = 20x^4\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   -6x \\times 4x^2 = -24x^3\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   7 \\times 4x^2 = 28x^2\n   \\]\n   \n   **Subtotal:**\n   \\[\n   20x^4 - 24x^3 + 28x^2\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Expand \\( (5x^2 - 6x + 7) \\) with \\( tx \\):**\n   \\[\n   5x^2 \\times tx = 5tx^3\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   -6x \\times tx = -6tx^2\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   7 \\times tx = 7tx\n   \\]\n   \n   **Subtotal:**\n   \\[\n   5tx^3 - 6tx^2 + 7tx\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Expand \\( (5x^2 - 6x + 7) \\) with \\( 10 \\):**\n   \\[\n   5x^2 \\times 10 = 50x^2\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   -6x \\times 10 = -60x\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   7 \\times 10 = 70\n   \\]\n   \n   **Subtotal:**\n   \\[\n   50x^2 - 60x + 70\n   \\]\n   \n**Combining All Parts:**\n\n\\[\n20x^4 + (-24x^3 + 5tx^3) + (28x^2 - 6tx^2 + 50x^2) + (7tx - 60x) + 70\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 20x^4 + (-24 + 5t)x^3 + (28 - 6t + 50)x^2 + (7t - 60)x + 70\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n= 20x^4 + (5t - 24)x^3 + (78 - 6t)x^2 + (7t - 60)x + 70\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- By expanding step by step, I can more easily identify any discrepancies in the coefficients.\n- Now, let's match these coefficients with the right-hand side.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Matching Coefficients Again**\n\n**Matching Coefficients:**\n\n1. **\\( x^4 \\):** \n   \\[\n   20 = 20 \\quad \\text{(Matches)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **\\( x^3 \\):** \n   \\[\n   5t -
