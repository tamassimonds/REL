    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll approach it step by step, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work along the way, and reflecting to make sure each part makes sense. I\u2019ll aim to think through it as naturally and messily as possible, just like a human tackling a math problem.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, **\"What is the least integer value of \\( x \\) such that \\( |2x + 7| \\leq 16 \\)?\"**, a few things come to mind:\n\n- **Absolute Value:** The presence of absolute value (\\(| \\cdot |\\)) makes me think about inequalities involving two cases: positive and negative.\n- **Linear Expression:** The expression inside the absolute value is linear (\\(2x + 7\\)), which reminds me of solving simple linear inequalities.\n- **Thresholds:** The inequality involves \\( \\leq 16 \\), so the values of \\(2x + 7\\) are bounded by \\(-16\\) and \\(16\\).\n\nHonestly, at first glance, I recall that I\u2019ve dealt with absolute value inequalities before, but I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s exactly the same. I also think maybe I could set up two separate equations because of the absolute value, but I\u2019m a bit hazy on the details.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Split into Two Cases:** \n   - This is probably the most straightforward approach\u2014consider both \\(2x + 7 \\leq 16\\) and \\(2x + 7 \\geq -16\\).\n\n2. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Plotting the line \\(y = 2x + 7\\) and seeing where it lies within the bounds could be visually helpful.\n\n3. **Absolute Value Property:**\n   - Recall that \\(|a| \\leq b\\) implies \\(-b \\leq a \\leq b\\), so apply this directly.\n\n4. **Algebraic Manipulation:**\n   - Maybe manipulate the inequality algebraically to isolate \\(x\\) more directly.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m leaning toward **splitting into two cases** because it aligns with how absolute value inequalities are typically solved. But I\u2019ll explore each method briefly to see which feels more intuitive.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Split into Two Cases**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- This seems like the standard method. I remember that with absolute value inequalities, you deal with both the positive and negative scenarios separately.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **First Case:** \n   \\[\n   2x + 7 \\leq 16\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Second Case:**\n   \\[\n   2x + 7 \\geq -16\n   \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's solve these inequalities one by one.\n\n**First Case: \\(2x + 7 \\leq 16\\)**\n\n- Subtract 7 from both sides:\n  \\[\n  2x \\leq 16 - 7 \\\\\n  2x \\leq 9\n  \\]\n  \n- Divide both sides by 2:\n  \\[\n  x \\leq \\frac{9}{2} \\\\\n  x \\leq 4.5\n  \\]\n\n**Second Case: \\(2x + 7 \\geq -16\\)**\n\n- Subtract 7 from both sides:\n  \\[\n  2x \\geq -16 - 7 \\\\\n  2x \\geq -23\n  \\]\n  \n- Divide both sides by 2:\n  \\[\n  x \\geq -\\frac{23}{2} \\\\\n  x \\geq -11.5\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, combining both cases, we have:\n  \\[\n  -11.5 \\leq x \\leq 4.5\n  \\]\n  \n- This makes sense because the absolute value bounds \\(2x + 7\\) within these limits.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this seem correct? Well, the inequality \\(x \\leq 4.5\\) and \\(x \\geq -11.5\\) cover all integers from \\(-11\\) to \\(4\\), which seems reasonable.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Graphical Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Maybe plotting \\(y = 2x + 7\\) and seeing where it intersects the lines \\(y = 16\\) and \\(y = -16\\) could give me a visual confirmation.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Plot the Line \\(y = 2x + 7\\):**\n   - This line has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept at 7.\n\n2. **Find Intersection Points:**\n   - Set \\(2x + 7 = 16\\):\n     \\[\n     2x = 9 \\\\\n     x = 4.5\n     \\]\n   - Set \\(2x + 7 = -16\\):\n     \\[\n     2x = -23 \\\\\n     x = -11.5\n     \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n- The line intersects \\(y = 16\\) at \\(x = 4.5\\) and \\(y = -16\\) at \\(x = -11.5\\).\n- This confirms that the solution set is \\(x \\in [-11.5, 4.5]\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this align with what I got earlier? Yes, it does. So, the graphical method supports the algebraic approach.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Absolute Value Property**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Maybe I can apply the property of absolute values directly: \\(|a| \\leq b\\) means \\(-b \\leq a \\leq b\\).\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Apply the Property:**\n   \\[\n   |2x + 7| \\leq 16 \\implies -16 \\leq 2x + 7 \\leq 16\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Separate into Two Inequalities:**\n\n   - **First:** \n     \\[\n     -16 \\leq 2x + 7\n     \\]\n      \n     - Subtract 7 from both sides:\n       \\[\n       -23 \\leq 2x \\\\\n       x \\geq -11.5\n       \\]\n       \n   - **Second:** \n     \\[\n     2x + 7 \\leq 16\n     \\]\n     \n     - Subtract 7 from both sides:\n       \\[\n       2x \\leq 9 \\\\\n       x \\leq 4.5\n       \\]\n       \n**Reflection:**\n- Combining both inequalities, I get:\n  \\[\n  -11.5 \\leq x \\leq 4.5\n  \\]\n  \n- This matches the previous methods.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this make sense? Yes, it does. The least integer value within this range is \\(-11\\).\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies\u2014splitting into two cases, using a graphical approach, and applying the absolute value property\u2014I've consistently arrived at the same solution:\n\n\\[\n-11.5 \\leq x \\leq 4.5\n\\]\n\n**Least Integer Value of \\( x \\):**\n- The least integer within this range is \\(-11\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does this feel correct?** Yes, all methods pointed to the same range, and the integer bounds align with the absolute value inequality.\n- **Is there anything I missed?** I briefly considered other approaches, like manipulating the inequality differently or checking for extraneous solutions, but they all led back to the same conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-11}\n\\]\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by identifying the nature of the inequality (absolute value) and recalling related strategies.\n- **Strategy Exploration:** Tried different methods\u2014splitting into two cases, graphical confirmation, and applying absolute value properties\u2014to ensure accuracy.\n- **Reflection and Checking:** Continuously checked if each method aligned and if the final integer value made sense within the given constraints.\n- **Conclusion:** Confirmed that the least integer value of \\( x \\) satisfying the inequality is \\(-11\\).\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure to reflect often, check my work at each step, and be open to changing my approach if something didn\u2019t seem right. This ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Clearly, the inequality has some solutions for which $2x+7$ is negative.  For example, if $x = -4$, then $2x+7 = -1$, so $|2x+7| = 1$, which is less than 16.  As we make $x$ even smaller, $2x+7$ gets even more less than zero, so $|2x+7|$ gets larger.  But how small can we make $x$?  To figure this out, we note that if $2x+7$ is negative, then $|2x+7| = -(2x+7)$.  Then, our inequality becomes $-(2x+7) \\le 16$.  Multiplying both sides by $-1$ (and flipping the direction of the inequality symbol) gives $2x +7 \\ge -16$.  Subtracting 7 and then dividing by 2 gives $x \\ge -11.5$.  So, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ is $\\boxed{-11}$.  Checking, we see that when $x=-11$, we have $|2x + 7| = 15$, which is less than 16."
