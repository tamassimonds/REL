    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where it takes us. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorming strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way\u2014just like how I would tackle it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem gives us a matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) and two vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), along with their transformations:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe goal is to compute \\(\\mathbf{M} (\\mathbf{v} + 3 \\mathbf{w})\\).\n\nInitial thought: **This looks like a linear transformation problem.** I remember there are properties of matrices and vectors that could help here, especially distributive properties. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure if that's the only approach. Maybe there's another way using matrix multiplication directly.\n\nReflecting: **Does this remind me of something familiar?** Yes, I think I've seen similar problems where you leverage linearity properties of matrices. But then again, trying to multiply out directly could work too. Let me brainstorm a bit more to see which path feels right.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Distributive Property of Matrices:**\n\n   - **Idea:** We know that matrices distribute over vector addition. So, perhaps I can distribute \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) over \\(\\mathbf{v} + 3\\mathbf{w}\\).\n   \n   - **Thoughts:** This seems straightforward since we already have \\(\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{w}\\). But, does this work with the scalar multiplication (the \\(3\\mathbf{w}\\))? I think it should because matrices can handle scalar multiplications within the distributive property.\n\n2. **Compute \\(\\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{v} + 3\\mathbf{w})\\) Directly:**\n\n   - **Idea:** Write out \\(\\mathbf{v} + 3\\mathbf{w}\\) explicitly and then multiply \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) by this resulting vector.\n   \n   - **Thoughts:** This would require knowing both \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) explicitly, which we don't have. So, maybe not the best approach without additional info.\n\n3. **Express \\(\\mathbf{v} + 3\\mathbf{w}\\) in Terms of Known Outputs:**\n\n   - **Idea:** Perhaps I can express \\(\\mathbf{v} + 3\\mathbf{w}\\) in terms of combinations of \\(\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{w}\\) that are already known.\n   \n   - **Thoughts:** This might be tricky since the problem doesn't directly provide such a relation. But maybe there's a clever way to link them.\n\nReflecting: **The distributive property seems the most promising.** It utilizes the information we already have without needing to know \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) explicitly. But I'll proceed cautiously and check along the way to ensure it's correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Distributive Property**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWe want to compute:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} (\\mathbf{v} + 3 \\mathbf{w})\n\\]\n\nUsing the distributive property of matrices:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} (\\mathbf{v} + 3 \\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{M} (3 \\mathbf{w})\n\\]\n\nReflection: **Does this look right?** Yes, I remember that matrices can distribute over addition, and scalar multiplication can be factored out as well.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying \\(\\mathbf{M} (3 \\mathbf{w})\\)**\n\nNow, I need to handle \\(\\mathbf{M} (3 \\mathbf{w})\\). I recall that:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} (c \\mathbf{w}) = c \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{w}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(c\\) is a scalar. So,\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} (3 \\mathbf{w}) = 3 \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{w} = 3 \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -15 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCheck: **Multiplying by 3 seems correct. **Let's see:**\n\n\\[\n3 \\times -2 = -6\\quad \\text{and}\\quad 3 \\times -5 = -15\n\\]\n\nYes, that works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Adding \\(\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{M} (3 \\mathbf{w})\\)**\n\nNow, I need to combine \\(\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{M} (3 \\mathbf{w})\\):\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{M} (3 \\mathbf{w}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -15 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the addition:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 + (-6) \\\\ 3 + (-15) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -12 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nReflection: **Does this addition make sense?** Let's double-check:\n\n\\[\n2 + (-6) = -4\\quad \\text{and}\\quad 3 + (-15) = -12\n\\]\n\nYes, both are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nSo, the computation yields:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} (\\mathbf{v} + 3 \\mathbf{w}) = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -12 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCheck: **Does this result seem reasonable?** We've applied the distributive property correctly, and all arithmetic checks out. I think this is the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Initially, I considered multiple strategies, but the distributive property was the most straightforward and applicable given the information provided.\n  \n- **Checking Work:** Throughout, I checked each step\u2014especially when dealing with scalar multiplication and vector addition\u2014to ensure the calculations were correct.\n\n- **Mistakes and Corrections:** There were no major mistakes, but reflecting at each stage helped confirm that the approach was on track.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** While trying to express \\(\\mathbf{v} + 3\\mathbf{w}\\) in terms of known outputs could be another method, it seemed unnecessary given the clarity of the distributive approach.\n\nOverall, taking it step-by-step with constant checking made the problem manageable and ensured the correct solution.\n\n---",
