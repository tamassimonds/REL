It's important to think like a human would, making sure each part of the thought process flows naturally.\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, **\"How many positive two-digit integers leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8?\"**, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Two-Digit Integers:** We're looking at numbers from 10 to 99.\n2. **Remainder of 2:** This reminds me of modular arithmetic. A number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 8 can be expressed as \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 8 \\).\n3. **Divisibility by 8:** I recall that numbers divisible by 8 have specific patterns, and adding a remainder changes that pattern.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n- **Modular Arithmetic Approach:** Use \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 8 \\) to find all relevant numbers within the two-digit range.\n- **List All Two-Digit Multiples of 8 and Adjust:** Start listing multiples of 8 and add 2 where necessary.\n- **Algebraic Approach:** Set up an equation to solve for \\( n \\) that fits both being a two-digit number and leaving a remainder of 2 when divided by 8.\n\nAt first glance, the **Modular Arithmetic Approach** seems the most straightforward, but I'll explore each method to see which works best.\n\n### **Exploring the Modular Arithmetic Approach**\n\n**Step 1: Understanding \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 8 \\)**\n\nThis means that when \\( n \\) is divided by 8, the remainder is 2. So, \\( n \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nn = 8k + 2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, so we're looking for \\( n \\) in the form of \\( 8k + 2 \\). I need to find all such \\( n \\) that are also two-digit numbers (between 10 and 99).\n\n**Step 2: Determining the Range for \\( k \\)**\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be between 10 and 99, I can set up inequalities to find the possible values of \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n10 \\leq 8k + 2 \\leq 99\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 2 from all parts:\n\n\\[\n8 \\leq 8k \\leq 97\n\\]\n\nDividing by 8:\n\n\\[\n1 \\leq k \\leq 12.125\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Wait a moment. Since \\( k \\) must be an integer, it can only take values from 1 to 12. I can't have \\( k = 12.125 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Possible \\( n \\) Values**\n\nNow, I'll calculate \\( n \\) for each integer \\( k \\) from 1 to 12:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nk = 1: & \\quad n = 8(1) + 2 = 10 \\\\\nk = 2: & \\quad n = 8(2) + 2 = 18 \\\\\nk = 3: & \\quad n = 8(3) + 2 = 26 \\\\\nk = 4: & \\quad n = 8(4) + 2 = 34 \\\\\nk = 5: & \\quad n = 8(5) + 2 = 42 \\\\\nk = 6: & \\quad n = 8(6) + 2 = 50 \\\\\nk = 7: & \\quad n = 8(7) + 2 = 58 \\\\\nk = 8: & \\quad n = 8(8) + 2 = 66 \\\\\nk = 9: & \\quad n = 8(9) + 2 = 74 \\\\\nk = 10: & \\quad n = 8(10) + 2 = 82 \\\\\nk = 11: & \\quad n = 8(11) + 2 = 90 \\\\\nk = 12: & \\quad n = 8(12) + 2 = 98 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** All these numbers (10, 18, 26, ..., 98) are two-digit integers and fit the condition \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 8 \\).\n\n### **Cross-Verification with Another Approach**\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Listing Two-Digit Multiples of 8 and Adding 2**\n\n**Step 4: Listing Two-Digit Multiples of 8**\n\nThe smallest two-digit multiple of 8 is 16, and the largest is 96. I'll list these:\n\n\\[\n16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Wait, these are all the two-digit multiples of 8. To satisfy our original condition, we need to add 2 to each of these:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n16 + 2 &= 18 \\\\\n24 + 2 &= 26 \\\\\n32 + 2 &= 34 \\\\\n40 + 2 &= 42 \\\\\n48 + 2 &= 50 \\\\\n56 + 2 &= 58 \\\\\n64 + 2 &= 66 \\\\\n72 + 2 &= 74 \\\\\n80 + 2 &= 82 \\\\\n88 + 2 &= 90 \\\\\n96 + 2 &= 98 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This method seems to replicate what we did in the first approach. The results are the same: 18, 26, 34, ..., 98.\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Step 5: Counting the Valid \\( n \\) Values**\n\nLet's count the numbers we found:\n\n\\[\n\\{10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 58, 66, 74, 82, 90, 98\\}\n\\]\n\nThere are **12** numbers in total.\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Each number is two digits and leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 8. The pattern follows the \\( n = 8k + 2 \\) formula, and all calculations are within the two-digit range.\n\n**Thought Process:** Initially, I thought maybe there could be a simpler pattern or a mistake in the upper limit for \\( k \\), but both approaches (modular arithmetic and listing multiples) consistently lead to the same valid set of numbers.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**There are 12 positive two-digit integers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8:**\n\n\\[\n10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 58, 66, 74, 82, 90, 98\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** By exploring different strategies and verifying each step, I ensured the accuracy of the solution. Checking the work regularly helped catch potential mistakes and confirm that the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Approaching the problem from multiple angles not only solidified the correctness but also provided confidence in the methodology. If one strategy seemed unclear, switching to another helped maintain clarity and correctness. Always reflecting and checking along the way is crucial in problem-solving to avoid and correct errors early.",

We examine the inequality, $$ 10 \\le 8n + 2 < 100. $$Subtracting 2 from all parts simplifies things: $$ 8 \\le 8n < 98. $$Dividing everything by 8 isolates the possible values of $n$: $$ 1 \\le n < 12\\, \\frac{1}{4}. $$Since $n$ can be any integer from 1 to 12, there are $\\boxed{12}$ two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ (that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8)."
