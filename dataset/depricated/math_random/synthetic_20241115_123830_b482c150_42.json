    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their validity, and checking our work along the way. I want to treat this like a natural human thought process, where I explore various approaches, make adjustments as needed, and ensure the solution makes sense throughout.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, it involves a cylinder's radius and height affecting its volume. The specifics are:\n\n- **Increasing the radius by \\(6\\) units** increases the volume by \\(y\\) cubic units.\n- **Increasing the height by \\(6\\) units** also increases the volume by \\(y\\) cubic units.\n- The original height is \\(2\\).\n  \nI need to find the original radius.\n\nMy initial reaction is to recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(r\\) is the radius and \\(h\\) is the height. Given that the height is increased by \\(6\\) units in one scenario and the radius by \\(6\\) units in another, it seems like we can set up equations based on the changes in volume.\n\nBut honestly, I'm a bit unsure about how to relate both scenarios to find a single value for the radius. It looks like a systems of equations problem, but I need to brainstorm how to set it up correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Set Up Volume Equations for Both Changes:**\n   - Use the volume formula to write expressions for the volume before and after each change.\n   \n2. **Express \\(y\\) in Terms of \\(r\\):**\n   - Since both changes result in an increase of \\(y\\) cubic units, maybe I can relate \\(y\\) to \\(r\\).\n   \n3. **Substitute Known Height:**\n   - Since the original height is \\(2\\), that should simplify things a bit.\n\n4. **Check for Simplifications:**\n   - Perhaps the equations can be simplified or equated to find \\(r\\) directly.\n\n5. **Consider Special Cases:**\n   - Maybe testing a couple of radii from the options can help validate the approach.\n\nI'm leaning towards setting up the volume equations first. Let\u2019s see if that leads me in the right direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Set Up Volume Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI want to create two equations based on the problem's descriptions\u2014one for the radius increase and one for the height increase. Since the volume changes by \\(y\\) cubic units in both cases, I can set them equal to \\(y\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Original Volume (\\(V_1\\)):**\n   \\[\n   V_1 = \\pi r^2 \\times 2 = 2\\pi r^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **New Volume After Increasing Radius (\\(V_2\\)):**\n   \\[\n   V_2 = \\pi (r + 6)^2 \\times 2 = 2\\pi (r + 6)^2\n   \\]\n   \n   Increase in Volume:\n   \\[\n   V_2 - V_1 = 2\\pi [(r + 6)^2 - r^2] = y\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   (r + 6)^2 - r^2 = r^2 + 12r + 36 - r^2 = 12r + 36\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2\\pi (12r + 36) = y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 24\\pi (r + 3)\n   \\]\n\n3. **New Volume After Increasing Height (\\(V_3\\)):**\n   \\[\n   V_3 = \\pi r^2 \\times (2 + 6) = \\pi r^2 \\times 8\n   \\]\n   \n   Increase in Volume:\n   \\[\n   V_3 - V_1 = \\pi r^2 \\times 8 - 2\\pi r^2 = 6\\pi r^2 = y\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth scenarios give me expressions for \\(y\\):\n\n- From the radius increase: \\(y = 24\\pi (r + 3)\\)\n- From the height increase: \\(y = 6\\pi r^2\\)\n\nI can set these two expressions equal to each other since both equal \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n24\\pi (r + 3) = 6\\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nThis looks like a solvable equation for \\(r\\). Let\u2019s proceed to solve it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solve for \\(r\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find \\(r\\), I need to simplify the equation \\(24\\pi (r + 3) = 6\\pi r^2\\). I notice that \\(\\pi\\) appears in both sides, so I can divide by \\(\\pi\\) to simplify. Let\u2019s see if that simplifies the equation nicely.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   24\\pi (r + 3) = 6\\pi r^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 24(r + 3) = 6r^2 \\quad \\text{(dividing both sides by \\(\\pi\\))}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   24r + 72 = 6r^2\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Rearrange into Standard Quadratic Form:**\n   \\[\n   6r^2 - 24r - 72 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Simplify the Quadratic Equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Divide all terms by 6:} \\quad r^2 - 4r - 12 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, now I have a quadratic equation: \\(r^2 - 4r - 12 = 0\\). This looks familiar. Quadratic equations can typically be solved using factoring, the quadratic formula, or completing the square. Let\u2019s see if it factors nicely.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Attempt Factoring the Quadratic**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe I can factor the quadratic equation \\(r^2 - 4r - 12 = 0\\) to find the value of \\(r\\). Factoring would be the quickest method if it works. Let's check if it's factorable.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Looking for Two Numbers That Multiply to \\(-12\\) and Add to \\(-4\\):**\n   \n   The product is \\(-12\\) and the sum is \\(-4\\). Possible pairs are:\n   - \\(-6\\) and \\(2\\)\n   - \\(6\\) and \\(-2\\)\n   - Other combinations don't sum up to \\(-4\\)\n   \n   So, the correct pair is \\(-6\\) and \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Factoring the Quadratic:**\n   \\[\n   r^2 - 4r - 12 = (r - 6)(r + 2) = 0\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solving for \\(r\\):**\n   \\[\n   r - 6 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r = 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r = -2\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\nI have two potential solutions for \\(r\\): \\(6\\) and \\(-2\\). But wait, a negative radius doesn't make sense physically in this context. The radius of a cylinder must be positive. Therefore, the only viable solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\nHowever, to ensure correctness, let's double-check this solution by substituting \\(r = 6\\) back into the original volume change conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Solution by Substituting \\(r = 6\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing \\(r = 6\\) as the correct answer, it's essential to verify whether this value satisfies both conditions given in the problem. This step will confirm the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Original Volume (\\(V_1\\)):**\n   \\[\n   V_1 = 2\\pi (6^2) = 2\\pi \\times 36 = 72\\pi\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Volume After Increasing Radius by 6 Units (\\(V_2\\)):**\n   \\[\n   V_2 = 2\\pi (6 + 6)^2 = 2\\pi \\times 12^2 = 2\\pi \\times 144 = 288\\pi\n   \\]\n   \n   Increase in Volume:\n   \\[\n   V_2 - V_1 = 288\\pi - 72\\pi = 216\\pi\n   \\]\n   \n   So, \\(y = 216\\pi\\).\n\n3. **Volume After Increasing Height by 6 Units (\\(V_3\\)):**\n   \\[\n   V_3 = \\pi (6^2) \\times (2 + 6) = \\pi \\times 36 \\times 8 = 288\\pi\n   \\]\n   \n   Increase in Volume:\n   \\[\n   V_3 - V_1 = 288\\pi - 72\\pi = 216\\pi\n   \\]\n   \n   So, \\(y = 216\\pi\\) again.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth scenarios yield the same value for \\(y\\) when \\(r = 6\\). This consistent result confirms that \\(r = 6\\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThroughout this problem, I started by brainstorming various strategies to relate the changes in volume to the cylinder's radius and height. Setting up volume equations for both scenarios led to a quadratic equation, which I was able to factor to find the radius.\n\nAlthough factoring initially seemed straightforward, verifying the solution ensured accuracy, especially since the negative radius was extraneous in this context. Regular checks and reflections helped maintain the correctness of each step, leading to the final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "We know that the volume of a cylinder is equal to $\\pi r^2h$, where $r$ and $h$ are the radius and height, respectively. So we know that $2\\pi (r+6)^2-2\\pi r^2=y=\\pi r^2(2+6)-2\\pi r^2$. Expanding and rearranging, we get that $2\\pi (12r+36)=6\\pi r^2$. Divide both sides by $6\\pi$ to get that $4r+12=r^2$, and rearrange to see that $r^2-4r-12=0$. This factors to become $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=6$ or $r=-2$. Obviously, the radius cannot be negative, so our answer is $\\boxed{6}$"
