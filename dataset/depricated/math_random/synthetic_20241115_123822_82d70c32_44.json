    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle the problem **1273 + 120 \u00f7 60 - 173**. I'll walk through it as naturally as I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach when needed.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I think, \"Okay, there's addition, division, and subtraction all mixed together. It reminds me of order of operations, specifically PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). So, I should probably follow that to get the correct result.\"\n\nBut then I wonder, \"Wait, should I apply PEMDAS immediately, or is there another strategy I can use that might make things clearer?\" Maybe I can evaluate each operation step by step, checking my work along the way to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Follow Order of Operations (PEMDAS):** \n   - Start with the division since it's the only operation inside the problem without parentheses.\n   \n2. **Evaluate Operations from Left to Right:**\n   - Handle the division first, then proceed with addition and subtraction in the order they appear.\n\n3. **Check Each Step Before Moving On:** \n   - Make sure each operation is correct before proceeding to avoid compounding errors.\n\nLet\u2019s try the first strategy\u2014following the order of operations\u2014and see how it goes. If it feels off at any point, I'll reconsider.\n\n### Step 1: Perform the Division\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nStart with the division because, according to PEMDAS, it's the highest priority. Let's see what 120 \u00f7 60 equals.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n120 \u00f7 60 = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat seems straightforward. Dividing 120 by 60 gives me 2. Quick check\u2014does that make sense? Yes, 60 goes into 120 twice.\n\n### Step 2: Rewrite the Expression\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I've handled the division, let\u2019s rewrite the original expression by substituting the result back in.\n\n**Expression:**\n\\[\n1273 + 2 - 173\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLooks good. Only the division part has changed; everything else remains the same.\n\n### Step 3: Perform Addition and Subtraction from Left to Right\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to handle the addition and subtraction. According to order of operations, I should perform these as they appear from left to right.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **First, Add 1273 and 2:**\n   \\[\n   1273 + 2 = 1275\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next, Subtract 173 from 1275:**\n   \\[\n   1275 - 173 = 1102\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Addition Check:**  \n  1273 plus 2 is 1275. Quick mental check\u2014yes, 1273 + 2 = 1275 works.\n\n- **Subtraction Check:**  \n  1275 minus 173 should give 1102. Let me break it down:  \n  - 1275 minus 100 is 1175.  \n  - 1175 minus 70 is 1105.  \n  - 1105 minus 3 is 1102.  \n  That checks out.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Final Answer\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore concluding, let's quickly verify the entire process to ensure there's no mistake. Did I follow the order of operations correctly? Did each step make sense?\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- Divided 120 by 60 correctly.\n- Added 1273 and 2 correctly.\n- Subtracted 173 from 1275 correctly.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything seems to flow logically, and the checks align with the calculations. The final answer feels correct.\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\n**Exploring a Different Strategy:**  \nMaybe I could have tackled the problem by thinking about grouping the operations differently, but that initially seems unnecessary because following PEMDAS worked smoothly. However, it's always good to consider whether simplifying parts of the expression first could help, such as recognizing that addition and subtraction are straightforward and don't require reordering.\n\n**Wait, Is There an Easier Way?**  \nLooking back, perhaps simplifying the division first made the subsequent addition and subtraction clearer. In more complex expressions, grouping like terms or factoring might help, but here, following PEMDAS was effective.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully following the order of operations, checking each step, and verifying the calculations, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1102}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, reflecting on each part of the process, and verifying the calculations frequently, I ensured accuracy throughout. Initially brainstorming different strategies helped confirm that following PEMDAS was the right path. Regular checks prevented errors and provided confidence in the final answer. This methodical approach mimics human problem-solving, where thoughts, doubts, and corrections naturally occur.",

  "ground_truth": "Recall that division should be carried out before addition. So  \\[\n1273 + 120 \\div 60 - 173 = 1273 + (120 \\div 60) - 173 = 1273 + 2 - 173.\n\\]Noticing that 1273 and 173 both end in 73, we write this expression as the sum of three numbers so we can use the commutative property of addition to rearrange. We get  \\begin{align*}\n1273 + 2 - 173 &= 1273 + 2 + (-173) \\\\\n&= 1273 + (-173)+2 \\\\\n&= 1273 -173 + 2 \\\\\n&= 1100 + 2 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{1102}.\n\\end{align*}"
