    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The question is about finding the value of \\( 25_{10} + 36_{10} \\) in base 3.\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming:**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, my initial reaction is:\n\n- **Understanding the Question:** We're dealing with addition in different number bases. The numbers \\( 25 \\) and \\( 36 \\) are both in base 10 (decimal), and we need to add them together and then convert the result into base 3.\n  \n- **Approaches I Can Consider:**\n  1. **Add in Base 10 First:** Add \\( 25 \\) and \\( 36 \\) together in base 10, and then convert the sum to base 3.\n  2. **Convert Each Number to Base 3 First and Then Add:** Convert \\( 25 \\) and \\( 36 \\) from base 10 to base 3 individually, and then add them together in base 3.\n  3. **Perform Base 3 Addition Directly:** Think about how addition works in base 3 and apply that directly to the base 10 numbers, although this seems more complex.\n\n- **Feeling About the Approaches:** Adding in base 10 first seems straightforward, and converting the sum to base 3 afterward should work. On the other hand, converting each number to base 3 first might align better with how base addition typically works, ensuring accuracy in base 3.\n\n### **Exploring the First Approach: Add in Base 10 First**\n\n**Step 1:** Add \\( 25_{10} \\) and \\( 36_{10} \\) in base 10.\n\n\\[\n25 + 36 = 61\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, that seems straightforward. But I need to make sure I'm converting this correctly into base 3. Let me think about whether directly converting \\( 61 \\) to base 3 will be accurate.\n\n**Step 2:** Convert \\( 61_{10} \\) to base 3.\n\nTo convert from base 10 to base 3, we divide the number by 3 and keep track of the remainders.\n\n\\[\n61 \\div 3 = 20 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 1\n\\]\n\\[\n20 \\div 3 = 6 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 2\n\\]\n\\[\n6 \\div 3 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\div 3 = 0 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 2\n\\]\n\n**Stacking the Remainders:** The base 3 representation is read from bottom to top: \\( 2021_3 \\).\n\n**Check:** Let's quickly check if converting \\( 2021_3 \\) back to base 10 gives us \\( 61 \\):\n\\[\n2 \\times 3^3 + 0 \\times 3^2 + 2 \\times 3^1 + 1 \\times 3^0 = 54 + 0 + 6 + 1 = 61\n\\]\nThis matches, so the conversion is correct.\n\n**Reflection:** This approach seems to work. Adding in base 10 first and then converting to base 3 gives a correct result. But let's explore the second approach to see if it aligns and perhaps catch any oversights.\n\n### **Exploring the Second Approach: Convert Each Number to Base 3 First and Then Add**\n\n**Step 1:** Convert \\( 25_{10} \\) to base 3.\n\n\\[\n25 \\div 3 = 8 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 1\n\\]\n\\[\n8 \\div 3 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 2\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\div 3 = 0 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 2\n\\]\n\n**Base 3 Representation:** \\( 221_3 \\)\n\n**Check:** Converting \\( 221_3 \\) back to base 10 to verify:\n\\[\n2 \\times 3^2 + 2 \\times 3^1 + 1 \\times 3^0 = 18 + 6 + 1 = 25\n\\]\nThis matches, so the conversion is correct.\n\n**Step 2:** Convert \\( 36_{10} \\) to base 3.\n\n\\[\n36 \\div 3 = 12 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 0\n\\]\n\\[\n12 \\div 3 = 4 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 0\n\\]\n\\[\n4 \\div 3 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 1\n\\]\n\\[\n1 \\div 3 = 0 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 1\n\\]\n\n**Base 3 Representation:** \\( 1100_3 \\)\n\n**Check:** Converting \\( 1100_3 \\) back to base 10 to verify:\n\\[\n1 \\times 3^3 + 1 \\times 3^2 + 0 \\times 3^1 + 0 \\times 3^0 = 27 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 36\n\\]\nThis matches, so the conversion is correct.\n\n**Step 3:** Add \\( 221_3 \\) and \\( 1100_3 \\) in base 3.\n\nLet's align the numbers and add them like we do in base 10, carrying over when necessary.\n\n```\n   1100\n+   221\n-------\n```\n\n**Adding Column by Column:**\n\n- **Rightmost Column:** \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\) (no carry)\n- **Second Column:** \\( 0 + 2 = 2 \\) (no carry)\n- **Third Column:** \\( 0 + 2 = 2 \\) (no carry)\n- **Leftmost Column:** \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\) (no carry)\n\n**Result:** \\( 2222_3 \\)\n\n**Reflection:** Let's double-check if \\( 2222_3 \\) makes sense. Converting \\( 2222_3 \\) back to base 10:\n\\[\n2 \\times 3^3 + 2 \\times 3^2 + 2 \\times 3^1 + 2 \\times 3^0 = 54 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 80\n\\]\nBut wait, this seems off. Our original sum in base 10 was \\( 61 \\), but \\( 2222_3 \\) converts to \\( 80 \\). This suggests an error in the addition step in base 3.\n\n**Identifying the Mistake:** Maybe there was a mishap in how carries were handled in base 3 addition. Let's take a closer look.\n\n**Re-examining Base 3 Addition:**\n\nIn base 3, when a column's sum reaches 3 or more, we need to carry over to the next column. Let's redo the addition with this in mind.\n\n```\n   1100\n+   221\n-------\n```\n\n**Adding Column by Column with Carrying:**\n\n- **Rightmost Column:** \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\) (no carry)\n- **Second Column:** \\( 0 + 2 = 2 \\) (no carry)\n- **Third Column:** \\( 0 + 2 = 2 \\) (no carry)\n- **Leftmost Column:** \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\) (no carry)\n\nWait, this is the same result. The base 3 addition seems straightforward, but the final conversion to base 10 doesn't align.\n\n**Possible Oversight:** Perhaps the issue lies in how we interpreted the base 3 addition. In base 3, \\( 2 + 1 \\) should result in \\( 10 \\) (which means \\( 0 \\) with a carry of \\( 1 \\)), but in our case, each column's sum was less than 3, so no carries were needed.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on this approach, the addition in base 3 yielded \\( 2222_3 \\), but it doesn't align with the base 10 sum of \\( 61 \\). This discrepancy suggests that the first approach\u2014adding in base 10 first and then converting to base 3\u2014might be more reliable.\n\n### **Final Approach: Sticking with the First Approach**\n\nGiven the confusion with the second approach, I'll proceed with the first method:\n\n**Step 1:** Confirm the base 10 addition.\n\n\\[\n25 + 36 = 61\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Convert \\( 61_{10} \\) to base 3.\n\n\\[\n61 \\div 3 = 20 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 1\n\\]\n\\[\n20 \\div 3 = 6 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 2\n\\]\n\\[\n6 \\div 3 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\div 3 = 0 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 2\n\\]\n\n**Base 3 Representation:** \\( 2021_3 \\)\n\n**Final Check:** Converting \\( 2021_3 \\) back to base 10:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 3^3 + 0 \\times 3^2 + 2 \\times 3^1 + 1 \\times 3^0 = 54 + 0 + 6 + 1 = 61\n\\]\n\nThis matches the original base 10 sum, confirming that the conversion is correct.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe value of \\( 25_{10} + 36_{10} \\) in base 3 is **\\( 2021_3 \\)**.\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process:**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Thought about different strategies\u2014adding in base 10 first vs. converting to base 3 first.\n- **First Approach:** Added in base 10 and converted the sum to base 3, which yielded a correct result.\n- **Second Approach:** Attempted to convert each number to base 3 before adding, but faced discrepancies in base 3 addition.\n- **Reflection and Correction:** Realized the second approach didn't align, so I confirmed the first method as correct.\n- **Final Check:** Verified the conversion back to base 10 to ensure accuracy.\n\nThroughout the process, I regularly checked for correctness, identified potential mistakes, and adjusted the approach accordingly, ensuring a reliable solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Start by adding the two numbers in base 10, we have $25_{10}+36_{10}=61_{10}$. Next, it is necessary to convert $61_{10}$ to base 3. The largest power of $3$ less than or equal to $61$ is $3^3=27$. The greatest multiple of this power that is less than $61$ is $2\\cdot 3^3=54$, so the digit in the $3^3$ place is $2$. Now, we subtract $54$ from $61$ and get $7$. Since $3^2>7$, the digit in the $3^2$ place is $0$. We know that $3^1$ goes into $7$ twice without going over, so the digit in the $3^1$ place is $2$. Finally, $7-6=1$, so the digit in the $3^0$ place is $1$. Therefore, the value of $25_{10}+36_{10}$ in base 3 is $\\boxed{2021_3}$."
