    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like how I would naturally work through it if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the question is asking about three real numbers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) that sum up to zero: \n\n\\[ \na + b + c = 0 \n\\]\n\nWe need to find the set of all possible values for \\( ab + ac + bc \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Reflection:** This looks familiar; I\u2019ve dealt with symmetric expressions before. I remember that sometimes such problems involve factoring or using known identities.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Use of Symmetric Polynomials:** Maybe relate \\( ab + ac + bc \\) to known symmetric polynomials.\n  2. **Substitution Method:** Since \\( a + b + c = 0 \\), perhaps express one variable in terms of the others.\n  3. **Graphical Approach:** Visualize the relationship to understand possible values.\n  4. **Using Quadratic Equations:** Set up a quadratic equation involving \\( ab + ac + bc \\).\n\n- **Uncertainty:** At this point, I'm not sure which method will be the most straightforward. I think starting with substitution might help simplify things, but let me explore that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Substitution Method**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nSince \\( a + b + c = 0 \\), I can express one variable in terms of the others. Let's solve for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\nc = - (a + b)\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Wait, that might be helpful:** Substituting this into \\( ab + ac + bc \\) could reduce the number of variables and make it easier to analyze.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubstitute \\( c = - (a + b) \\) into \\( ab + ac + bc \\):\n\n\\[\nab + a(-a - b) + b(-a - b) \n\\]\n\nSimplify step by step:\n\n1. **Distribute:**\n   \\[\n   ab - a^2 - ab - ab - b^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Combine like terms:**\n   \\[\n   -a^2 - b^2 - ab\n   \\]\n\nSo, \n\n\\[\nab + ac + bc = -(a^2 + b^2 + ab)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Hmm, this looks like a quadratic expression:** I remember that such expressions can have minimum or maximum values depending on the relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n- **Is this correct?** Let me double-check the substitution:\n\n  - Original: \\( ab + ac + bc \\)\n  - After substitution: \\( ab - a(a + b) - b(a + b) \\)\n  - Simplified: \\( ab - a^2 - ab - ab - b^2 = - a^2 - b^2 - ab \\)\n\n  **Check:** Yes, that seems correct.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:**\n\n- By expressing \\( c \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), I reduced the problem to analyzing \\( -(a^2 + b^2 + ab) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing the Expression \\( -(a^2 + b^2 + ab) \\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nNow, I need to understand what values \\( a^2 + b^2 + ab \\) can take, especially since we want \\( ab + ac + bc \\), which is the negative of this expression.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Wait, I remember something about quadratic forms:** The expression \\( a^2 + b^2 + ab \\) resembles part of a square, which might help in finding its minimum value.\n\n- **Alternative Idea:** Maybe completing the square or using the discriminant of a related quadratic equation could work.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's attempt completing the square for \\( a^2 + b^2 + ab \\):\n\n1. **Group and Rearrange:**\n   \\[\n   a^2 + ab + \\frac{b^2}{4} - \\frac{b^2}{4} + b^2 = \\left(a + \\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{3b^2}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Interpretation:**\n   - The term \\( \\left(a + \\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 \\) is always non-negative.\n   - The term \\( \\frac{3b^2}{4} \\) is also non-negative.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 + ab \\geq 0\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Ahh, I see:** Since \\( a^2 + b^2 + ab \\geq 0 \\), it follows that \\( -(a^2 + b^2 + ab) \\leq 0 \\).\n\n- **Is this what I expect?** Yes, the expression \\( ab + ac + bc \\) should be non-positive because it's the negation of a sum of squares.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 2:**\n\n- The minimum value of \\( a^2 + b^2 + ab \\) is 0, which means the maximum value of \\( ab + ac + bc \\) is 0.\n- Therefore, \\( ab + ac + bc \\) can be non-positive, i.e., \\( ab + ac + bc \\leq 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Different Scenarios**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nLet\u2019s think about specific cases to ensure our conclusion holds universally.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Maybe check with specific values:** If I set \\( a, b, c \\) to specific numbers that satisfy \\( a + b + c = 0 \\), does it align with our findings?\n\n- **Wait, this will confirm the validity:** It\u2019s always good to verify with examples.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n**Case 1:** \\( a = 1, b = -1, c = 0 \\)\n\n\\[\nab + ac + bc = 1(-1) + 1(0) + (-1)(0) = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Case 2:** \\( a = 2, b = -1, c = -1 \\)\n\n\\[\nab + ac + bc = 2(-1) + 2(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -2 - 2 + 1 = -3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, both cases yield non-positive values:** This supports the conclusion that \\( ab + ac + bc \\leq 0 \\).\n\n- **Check:** In both cases, the sum is negative or zero.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 3:**\n\n- **Ahh, this confirms our earlier finding:** The expression \\( ab + ac + bc \\) is always non-positive.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with Symmetric Polynomials**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nAnother way to verify is by using symmetric polynomials. Since \\( a + b + c = 0 \\), perhaps leveraging known polynomial identities can help.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Hmm, I remember that for three variables, symmetric polynomials can express relationships among them.**\n\n- **Maybe the identity involving squares could be useful here.**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nRecall the identity for three variables:\n\n\\[\n(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc)\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( a + b + c = 0 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n0 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc)\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( ab + ac + bc \\):\n\n\\[\nab + ac + bc = -\\frac{1}{2}(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This makes sense:** Since \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\geq 0 \\), it follows that \\( ab + ac + bc \\leq 0 \\).\n\n- **Check:** This aligns with our earlier conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 4:**\n\n- **Ahh, another confirmation:** Using symmetric polynomials reinforces that \\( ab + ac + bc \\) is always non-positive.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Synthesizing the Findings**\n\n- **Throughout the process, different strategies led to the same conclusion:** Whether through substitution, analyzing specific cases, or leveraging symmetric polynomials, all paths point towards \\( ab + ac + bc \\leq 0 \\).\n\n- **Ahh, this gives confidence in the solution:** Multiple methods validating the result suggest that the approach is correct.\n\n- **Final Check:** \n\n  - **Does \\( ab + ac + bc \\) ever exceed 0?** No, as shown by all methods.\n\n  - **Is there a case where it equals 0?** Yes, for example, when \\( a = b = 1 \\) and \\( c = -2 \\):\n\n    \\[\n    ab + ac + bc = 1(-1) + 1(-2) + (-1)(-2) = -1 - 2 + 2 = -1\n    \\]\n    \n    However, to achieve \\( ab + ac + bc = 0 \\), we need \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 0 \\), which only happens if \\( a = b = c = 0 \\). But since \\( a + b + c = 0 \\), the only solution is \\( a = b = c = 0 \\), which is a trivial case.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The set of all possible values for \\( ab + ac + bc \\) is \\( (-\\infty, 0] \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nLet \\( a, b, c \\) be real numbers such that \\( a + b + c = 0 \\). The set of all possible values of \\( ab + ac + bc \\) is:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, 0]\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Process**\n\n1. **Brainstorming Different Strategies:** Explored substitution, specific value cases, and symmetric polynomials.\n   \n2. **Substitution Method:** Reduced the problem to analyzing \\( -(a^2 + b^2 + ab) \\).\n\n3. **Expression Analysis:** Determined that \\( a^2 + b^2 + ab \\geq 0 \\), leading to \\( ab + ac + bc \\leq 0 \\).\n\n4. **Verification with Specific Cases:** Confirmed the conclusion holds through examples.\n\n5. **Symmetric Polynomials:** Reinforced the finding using known identities.\n\n6. **Final Check:** Ensured no cases exceed 0 and identified that \\( ab + ac + bc = 0 \\) only in the trivial case.\n\n*By reflecting at each step and cross-validating with multiple approaches, we confidently arrived at the correct solution.*\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walk-through helps in understanding how to approach such problems methodically, checking and verifying at each step, and ensuring the solution is both accurate and comprehensible.",
