    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by thinking through it just like I would if I were tackling it on paper\u2014brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed. I'll walk through each step, exploring various methods, reflecting often, and making sure everything aligns correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The equation is \\( 14mn = 55 - 7m - 2n \\).\n- I need to find the ordered pair \\( (m, n) \\) where both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers.\n- **Initial Reflection:** This looks like a Diophantine equation, which typically involves integer solutions. That makes me think about factoring, rearranging terms, or perhaps substituting values to see patterns.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Rearrange the Equation:** Try to move all terms to one side to see if it simplifies.\n2. **Factor the Equation:** Look for common factors or patterns that can be factored easily.\n3. **Substitution Method:** Substitute possible integer values for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) to see if they satisfy the equation.\n4. **Graphical Method:** Though less common for integer solutions, graphing could provide visual insights.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 1: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Let\u2019s start by getting everything on one side to see what the equation looks like. This might reveal if it's factorable or if another method is needed.\n\n- **Attempt:**\n  \\[\n  14mn = 55 - 7m - 2n\n  \\]\n  **Rearrange:**\n  \\[\n  14mn + 7m + 2n - 55 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Hmm, having all terms on one side is neat, but it doesn't immediately suggest a straightforward factoring approach. Perhaps I need to explore further or try another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Factoring the Equation**\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...:**\n- From the previous step, factoring might not be intuitive here. The equation doesn't resemble standard factoring patterns like quadratics. Maybe I need to look for common factors or transform it differently.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Simplify the Equation**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Perhaps simplifying the equation by grouping terms differently could help. Let\u2019s try to factor out common terms.\n\n- **Attempt:**\n  \\[\n  14mn + 7m + 2n - 55 = 0\n  \\]\n  - **Factor by grouping?**\n  \n    - Group \\( 14mn + 7m \\) and \\( 2n - 55 \\):\n      \\[\n      7m(2n + 1) + 2n - 55 = 0\n      \\]\n      \n    - **Reflection:** This doesn't lead to immediate factoring. Maybe I need to think of another way. **Hmm, perhaps substitution might be a better path.**\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Substitution Method**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Idea:** Since \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers, perhaps I can substitute small integer values to see if I can find a pattern or a possible solution.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Start with small integers for \\( m \\) and calculate corresponding \\( n \\).\n- **Check:** See if both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) remain positive integers.\n\n**Attempt:**\n- **Let\u2019s try \\( m = 1 \\):**\n  \\[\n  14(1)n = 55 - 7(1) - 2n\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  14n = 55 - 7 - 2n\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  14n + 2n = 48\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  16n = 48\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  n = 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** **Oh!** I found \\( n = 3 \\) when \\( m = 1 \\). This seems promising. But let me check if there are multiple solutions or if this is unique.\n\n**Continuing with \\( m = 2 \\):**\n- **Attempt:**\n  \\[\n  14(2)n = 55 - 7(2) - 2n\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  28n = 55 - 14 - 2n\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  28n + 2n = 41\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  30n = 41\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{41}{30}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** **Wait, that can't be right because...** \\( n \\) must be an integer, but here it's not. This suggests that perhaps only certain values of \\( m \\) yield integer \\( n \\).\n\n**Conclusion So Far:**\n- **Possible Solution:** \\( (m, n) = (1, 3) \\)\n- **Observation:** Not all values of \\( m \\) lead to an integer \\( n \\). This indicates that \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 3 \\) might be the only positive integer solution pair.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 4: Checking the Solution**\n\n**Let\u2019s verify if \\( (m, n) = (1, 3) \\) satisfies the original equation:**\n- **Substitute \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 3 \\) into the original equation:**\n  \\[\n  14(1)(3) = 55 - 7(1) - 2(3)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  42 = 55 - 7 - 6\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  42 = 42\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** **Yes!** Both sides are equal, confirming that \\( (1, 3) \\) is indeed a solution.\n\n**Wait, Are There Other Solutions?**\n- Based on the substitution method, higher values of \\( m \\) either do not yield integer \\( n \\) or lead to larger non-integer solutions.\n- **Check:** Quick calculations for \\( m = 3 \\) and \\( m = 4 \\) show that \\( n \\) does not remain an integer.\n- **Conclusion:** **It appears that \\( (1, 3) \\) is unique** given the constraints of the problem (positive integers).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Reflection**\n\n**Does Everything Add Up?**\n- The solution \\( (m, n) = (1, 3) \\) satisfies the original equation.\n- Substituting \\( m = 1 \\) led to a valid integer \\( n = 3 \\).\n- Other attempts with different \\( m \\) values either returned non-integer \\( n \\) or complicated expressions that didn\u2019t yield new integer solutions.\n\n**Hmm, Maybe I Missed Something?**\n- Initially, I considered factoring and possibly graphical methods, but they didn\u2019t lead to straightforward solutions. Substitution proved most effective here.\n- **Ahah Moment:** Recognizing that not all \\( m \\) values yield integer \\( n \\) helped narrow down the potential solutions quickly.\n\n**Is There an Alternative Method I Could Have Tried?**\n- **Alternative Idea:** Setting up a system to solve for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) could work, but given the simplicity found with substitution, it wasn\u2019t necessary.\n- **Reflection:** Sometimes, starting with the simplest method (substitution) is best, especially when dealing with Diophantine equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying calculations, and reflecting on the approach's effectiveness, the ordered pair that satisfies the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(1, 3)}\n\\]\n\nThis detailed walkthrough ensures that every step is transparent, showcasing the thought process, checking for correctness, and adapting methods as needed\u2014much like a human would tackle a problem on paper.",

  "ground_truth": "Looking at the form of the equation, we see that we have two linear terms and their product.  We thus apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick.  The given equation rearranges to $14mn + 7m +2n +1 = 56$, which can be factored to $(7m + 1)(2n +1) = 56 = 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 7$.  Since $n$ is a positive integer, we see that $2n +1 > 1$ is odd.  Examining the factors on the right side, we see we must have $2n + 1 = 7$, implying $7m+1 = 2^3$.  Solving, we find that $(m,n) = \\boxed{(1,3)}$."
