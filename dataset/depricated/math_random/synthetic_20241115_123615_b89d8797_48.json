    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and reflecting on whether each step makes sense. \n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question about finding the distance between two planes, I think, \"Okay, this reminds me of finding the distance between parallel planes in three-dimensional space.\" But then I realize that not all planes are parallel, so I need to be careful here.\n\nMy initial thoughts lead me to consider:\n\n1. **Parallel Planes:** If the planes are parallel, the distance is straightforward.\n2. **Intersecting Planes:** If they intersect, the question of distance doesn't apply in the same way.\n3. **Non-parallel, Non-intersecting Planes:** These are the planes that don't intersect and are not parallel. They are skew, and their distance can be calculated using specific methods.\n\nLooking at the equations:\n\n- \\( x + 2y - 2z + 1 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 2x + 4y - 4z + 5 = 0 \\)\n\nI notice that the second equation is a scalar multiple of the first. This makes me suspect that the planes might be parallel after all.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Check for Parallelism:**\n   - Calculate the normal vectors of both planes.\n   - See if one is a multiple of the other.\n\n2. **Distance Formula for Parallel Planes:**\n   - If they are parallel, use the distance formula between parallel planes.\n\n3. **Confirming Parallelism:**\n   - If they're not parallel, explore other methods to find the distance.\n\n### **Step 1: Checking for Parallelism**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s start by determining if the planes are parallel. If they are, I can use the distance formula for parallel planes. \n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- The general form of a plane is \\( Ax + By + Cz + D = 0 \\).\n- For the first plane: \\( x + 2y - 2z + 1 = 0 \\)  \n  - Normal vector \\( \\mathbf{n_1} = (1, 2, -2) \\)\n  \n- For the second plane: \\( 2x + 4y - 4z + 5 = 0 \\)  \n  - Normal vector \\( \\mathbf{n_2} = (2, 4, -4) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a second. The normal vector of the second plane \\( \\mathbf{n_2} \\) is \\(2 \\times \\mathbf{n_1}\\). This suggests that the planes are parallel, as their normal vectors are multiples of each other.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- If the normal vectors are scalar multiples, the planes are parallel.\n- Quick check: \\( \\mathbf{n_2} = 2 \\times \\mathbf{n_1} \\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe planes are parallel. So, I can proceed with the distance formula for parallel planes.\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Distance Formula for Parallel Planes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince the planes are parallel, the distance \\( d \\) between them can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{|D_2 - D_1|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( Ax + By + Cz + D_1 = 0 \\) and \\( Ax + By + Cz + D_2 = 0 \\) are the equations of the planes.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **First Plane:** \\( x + 2y - 2z + 1 = 0 \\)  \n  - So, \\( A = 1 \\), \\( B = 2 \\), \\( C = -2 \\), \\( D_1 = 1 \\)\n\n- **Second Plane:** \\( 2x + 4y - 4z + 5 = 0 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 2 \\), \\( B = 4 \\), \\( C = -4 \\), but since it's a multiple of the first, I need to adjust it to match.\n\n**Adjustment:**\n\nTo bring the second plane to the same scale as the first, divide the entire equation by 2:\n\n\\[\nx + 2y - 2z + \\frac{5}{2} = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( D_2 = \\frac{5}{2} \\).\n\n**Plugging into the Formula:**\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{\\left|\\frac{5}{2} - 1\\right|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + (-2)^2}} = \\frac{\\left|\\frac{3}{2}\\right|}{\\sqrt{1 + 4 + 4}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{\\sqrt{9}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{3} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense. The distance between the two parallel planes is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) units. \n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Wait a Moment:**\n\nLet me double-check if all steps align correctly. \n\n- The normal vectors' relationship confirms parallelism.\n- The adjustment of the second plane's equation ensures both planes are on the same scale.\n- The distance formula application seems correct.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nI think the approach is correct, but let\u2019s ensure by considering an alternative method.\n\n### **Alternative Method: Using Points on One Plane**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSelect a point on the first plane and find the perpendicular distance to the second plane. If the planes are parallel, this distance should match the previously calculated distance.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Point on First Plane:** Let\u2019s find an easy point: Set \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( z = 0 \\) in the first plane equation:\n  \n  \\[\n  x + 2(0) - 2(0) + 1 = 0 \\implies x + 1 = 0 \\implies x = -1\n  \\]\n  \n  So, the point \\( P(-1, 0, 0) \\) lies on the first plane.\n\n- **Distance from Point P to the Second Plane:**\n\n  Use the distance formula from a point to a plane:\n  \n  \\[\n  d = \\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + Cz_0 + D|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}}\n  \\]\n  \n  Where:\n  - \\( (x_0, y_0, z_0) = (-1, 0, 0) \\)\n  - Second plane: \\( 2x + 4y - 4z + 5 = 0 \\)\n\n  Plugging in:\n  \n  \\[\n  d = \\frac{|2(-1) + 4(0) - 4(0) + 5|}{\\sqrt{2^2 + 4^2 + (-4)^2}} = \\frac{| -2 + 5 |}{\\sqrt{4 + 16 + 16}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{36}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation. The distance is indeed \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) units.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Checking Consistency:**\n\nBoth methods\u2014applying the distance formula for parallel planes and calculating the distance from a point on one plane to the other\u2014yield the same result: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThe approaches align, and the calculations are consistent. I feel confident that the distance between the two planes is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) units.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying with an alternative method, and checking the consistency of results, the distance between the planes \\( x + 2y - 2z + 1 = 0 \\) and \\( 2x + 4y - 4z + 5 = 0 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected on each step, ensuring the approach was correct and making adjustments as needed. This iterative checking helped confirm the validity of the solution.",
