    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it just as I would if I were solving it on paper\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The bakery has \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) of a pie left over at the end of the day.\n- Louie, Duey, and Huey each take home the same amount of leftover pie.\n- I need to find out how much pie Louie took home.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Fractional Distribution:** This reminds me of problems where a fraction of something is shared equally among several people. I\u2019ve tackled similar problems before, like dividing pizza slices.\n- **Equal Sharing:** Since each person takes home the same amount, I\u2019ll likely need to divide the total leftover pie by 3.\n- **Check for Whole Numbers:** Because I\u2019m dealing with fractions, I should consider whether the division results in a neat fraction or if there\u2019s a remainder.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Does dividing \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) by 3 give a manageable fraction?\n- Should I simplify the fraction after dividing?\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) is less than 1 whole pie, so dividing by 3 should still result in a fraction less than \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\).\n- This makes sense because each person is getting an equal share of a smaller portion.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Simple Fraction Division:**\n   - Divide \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) by 3 directly.\n   \n2. **Convert to Mixed Number:**\n   - Convert \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) to a mixed number, if possible, then divide.\n\n3. **Use Decimal Approach:**\n   - Convert the fraction to a decimal, divide by 3, then convert back to a fraction.\n\n**Choosing the Best Strategy:**\n\n- **Simple Fraction Division** seems the most straightforward since we're dealing with fractions and need an exact answer.\n- **Decimal Approach** might introduce unnecessary complexity by converting back and forth.\n- **Mixed Number Conversion** isn\u2019t applicable here since \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) is already a simple fraction less than 1.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I think **Simple Fraction Division** is the best approach. It directly addresses the problem without extra steps.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does dividing a fraction by an integer work as I recall? Yes, it should be straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Simple Fraction Division**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- To find out how much pie each person took home, divide \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) by 3.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{7} \\div 3\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Division by an integer involves multiplying the denominator by that integer.\n- So, I can rewrite the division as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{7} \\div 3 = \\frac{6}{7 \\times 3} = \\frac{6}{21}\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n\n- Now, simplify \\(\\frac{6}{21}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7} \\quad \\text{(by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- That makes sense. Each person takes home \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\) of the pie.\n- I\u2019ll **double-check**: Does \\(\\frac{6}{21}\\) simplify evenly? Yes, dividing both by 3 works.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) divided by 3 yields \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\), which is less than \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\). This checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Total Check:** If each person takes \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\), then together they should take \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\).\n- **Calculation Check:** Multiply the share by 3 to see if it equals the original amount:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{7} \\times 3 = \\frac{6}{7}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The calculation confirms the total matches the leftover pie.\n- This step ensures that the division was done correctly.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does \\(\\frac{2}{7} \\times 3 = \\frac{6}{7}\\)? Yes, it does.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- After verifying the calculation, I\u2019m confident that \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\) is the correct amount Louie took home.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Louie took home } \\frac{2}{7} \\text{ of the pie.}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The answer seems logical and matches the requirements of the problem.\n- No contradictions or inconsistencies are present.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- The fraction \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\) is less than \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\), which aligns with each person taking an equal, smaller share of the leftover pie.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy **brainstorming different strategies**, **applying the simplest method**, and **verifying the calculations**, I ensured that Louie took home \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\) of the pie. Throughout the process, I reflected and checked each step to confirm the correctness of the approach and the final answer. This step-by-step thinking mimics a natural human problem-solving approach, allowing for adjustments and validations along the way.",

  "ground_truth": "Since there are $3$ people who took home pieces of $\\frac{6}{7}$ of a pie, we must divide $\\frac{6}{7}$ by $3$. \\[\n\\frac{6}{7} \\div 3 = \\frac{6}{7} \\div \\frac{3}{1} = \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 1}{7 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{6}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{2}{7}.\n\\] Therefore Louie, Duey, and Huey each took home $\\frac{2}{7}$ of a pie, and as such, Louie took home $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}\\text{ of a pie}$."
