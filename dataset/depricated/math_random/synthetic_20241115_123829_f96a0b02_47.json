In mathematical terms, raising a number to the power of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is the same as taking its square root. \n\nSo, I can rewrite the expression as:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{16} - \\sqrt{625}\n\\]\n\nBut then I think, \"Wait, is there another way to approach this? Maybe simplifying the bases before taking the square roots could help.\" This reminds me of simplifying expressions by factoring, which might make the square roots more obvious.\n\nAnother approach could be to use properties of exponents to simplify before taking the square roots, but that seems unnecessary here since \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) already indicates square roots.\n\nLet me jot down these initial thoughts:\n\n- **Option 1:** Directly calculate \\(\\sqrt{16}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{625}\\).\n- **Option 2:** Factor the numbers under the square roots to see if that simplifies things.\n- **Option 3:** Explore using properties of exponents, but it feels redundant since \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) already implies a square root.\n\nAfter reflecting, I think the **Direct Calculation** approach seems straightforward and easy to verify, so I'll start there. If it feels too simple or doesn't work, I can always revisit and try factoring or another method.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate \\(\\sqrt{16}\\)**\n\nAlright, let's begin with the first term:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{16} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** \n\n- I know that \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\), so taking the square root of 16 gives me 4.\n- Quick check: \\(4^2 = 16\\), which confirms that the calculation is correct.\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nThis makes sense. The square root of a perfect square like 16 is an integer, which is straightforward.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate \\(\\sqrt{625}\\)**\n\nNow, let's tackle the second term:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{625} = 25\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Similarly, I recall that \\(25 \\times 25 = 625\\).\n- Quick check: \\(25^2 = 625\\), confirming the calculation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAgain, this aligns. The square root of 625 is also an integer, which simplifies the process.\n\n### **Step 3: Subtract the Two Results**\n\nNow that we have both square roots:\n\n\\[\n4 - 25 = -21\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Simple subtraction: 4 minus 25.\n- Negative result: I expected that since 25 is larger than 4.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe subtraction checks out. \\(4 - 25\\) is indeed \\(-21\\). Let me quickly verify:\n\n\\[\n4 - 25 = -21\\quad\\text{(correct)}\n\\]\n\n### **Checking the Work: Does It Make Sense?**\n\nAfter completing the steps, I should pause and reflect to ensure everything aligns:\n\n- **Square Roots Calculated Correctly:** Yes, both \\(\\sqrt{16}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{625}\\) were computed accurately.\n- **Subtraction Correct:** \\(4 - 25 = -21\\), which is consistent.\n- **Comparison:** The negative result makes sense since we're subtracting a larger square root from a smaller one.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nEverything checks out. The approach was straightforward, and the calculations are correct. However, to ensure completeness, let's briefly consider an alternative method just to triple-check.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Factoring Before Taking Square Roots**\n\n**Idea:** \n\nMaybe factoring \\(16\\) and \\(625\\) could provide additional insight.\n\n\\[\n16 = 4^2\\quad\\text{and}\\quad625 = 25^2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{16} = 4 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\sqrt{625} = 25\n\\]\n\nBut wait, this doesn't change anything since recognizing them as perfect squares was already implicit in the direct calculation approach.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this add any value? Not really, because the direct method was already straightforward. However, it's always good to explore different strategies to confirm the validity of the answer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies, the direct calculation method proved to be the most efficient:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{16} - \\sqrt{625} = 4 - 25 = -21\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\(\\boxed{-21}\\)\n\nReflection final touches:\n\n- **Initial Confusion Cleared:** Initially, I considered different methods, but realizing that the problem directly involves square roots simplified the process.\n- **Noticing Patterns:** Recognizing \\(16\\) and \\(625\\) as perfect squares made calculations straightforward.\n- **Ensuring Correctness:** Throughout, quick checks confirmed the accuracy of each step, leading to a reliable final answer.\n\n**Final Insight:**\n\nAlways reflecting and considering alternative methods, even when the first approach works, helps build confidence in the solution and ensures no errors were missed along the way.",
