    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work periodically to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I notice a few key elements:\n\n1. **Total Chocolate Amount:** Jordan has \\(\\frac{48}{5}\\) pounds of chocolate.\n2. **Number of Piles:** He wants to divide it into 4 equal piles.\n3. **Gift to Shaina:** One of these piles is given to Shaina.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Fraction Division:** This reminds me of dividing fractions or dealing with mixed numbers. I think I've encountered similar problems before where equal distribution is required.\n- **Checking the Fraction:** Wait, \\(\\frac{48}{5}\\) is an improper fraction. Maybe converting it to a mixed number could make things clearer. Let me think about that.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n- **Divide the Fraction Directly:** Split \\(\\frac{48}{5}\\) by 4 to find the weight of each pile.\n- **Convert to a Mixed Number:** Change \\(\\frac{48}{5}\\) to a mixed number to see if that simplifies the division.\n- **Use Decimal Conversion:** Convert the fraction to a decimal for easier division.\n\n**Reflection on Strategies:**\n\n- **Direct Division:** This seems straightforward. I can divide the numerator by 4 to find the weight of each pile.\n- **Mixed Number Conversion:** Might help in visualizing the problem better, but not sure if it's necessary.\n- **Decimal Conversion:** Could make the calculation easier but might introduce rounding errors if not careful.\n\n**Decision:** I think starting with direct division is the most straightforward. If it gets messy, I can try converting to a mixed number or decimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Dividing the Chocolate into Equal Piles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the weight of each pile, I need to divide the total amount of chocolate by the number of piles:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weight of each pile} = \\frac{\\frac{48}{5}}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's perform the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{48}{5}}{4} = \\frac{48}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{48 \\times 1}{5 \\times 4} = \\frac{48}{20}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so each pile weighs \\(\\frac{48}{20}\\) pounds. That simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{48}{20} = \\frac{48 \\div 4}{20 \\div 4} = \\frac{12}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Let me think. Dividing \\(\\frac{48}{5}\\) by 4 should reduce the fraction. \\(\\frac{48}{20}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{12}{5}\\), which feels right.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nJust to be sure, I could convert \\(\\frac{48}{5}\\) to a mixed number:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{48}{5} = 9 \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\nThen, divide \\(9 \\frac{3}{5}\\) by 4:\n\n\\[\n9 \\frac{3}{5} \\div 4 = \\frac{48}{5} \\div 4 = \\frac{12}{5}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 1:**\n\nEach pile weighs \\(\\frac{12}{5}\\) pounds.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining Shaina's Share**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nShaina receives one of these piles, so she gets \\(\\frac{12}{5}\\) pounds of chocolate. But let's double-check by considering different strategies to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Alternative Strategies:**\n\n1. **Using the Simplified Fraction:** Directly use \\(\\frac{12}{5}\\) as her share.\n2. **Converting to Mixed Number:** Change \\(\\frac{12}{5}\\) to a mixed number to make it more understandable.\n3. **Decimal Conversion:** Convert \\(\\frac{12}{5}\\) to a decimal to verify the weight.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Mixed Number Conversion:** \\(\\frac{12}{5} = 2 \\frac{2}{5}\\). This seems more intuitive.\n- **Decimal Conversion:** \\(\\frac{12}{5} = 2.4\\). This provides a quick check.\n\n**Decision:** Since both conversions lead to consistent results, I feel confident that Shaina's share is correctly calculated.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, it's essential to ensure that all calculations are correct. Let's revisit each step briefly.\n\n**Check of Step 1:**\n\n- Did dividing \\(\\frac{48}{5}\\) by 4 yield \\(\\frac{12}{5}\\)? Yes, the calculation \\(\\frac{48 \\times 1}{5 \\times 4} = \\frac{48}{20} = \\frac{12}{5}\\) is correct.\n\n**Check of Step 2:**\n\n- Does \\(\\frac{12}{5}\\) equal 2.4 pounds? Yes, \\(\\frac{12}{5} = 2.4\\), which makes sense.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAll checks align with the expected outcomes. The methods used are consistent, and the answers match across different strategies.\n\n**Alternative Validation:**\n\nLet\u2019s ensure that dividing the total chocolate by 4 piles logically leads to Shaina receiving \\(\\frac{12}{5}\\) pounds. Since each pile is an equal share of \\(\\frac{48}{5}\\), it follows that Shaina's share is \\(\\frac{12}{5}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies, verifying calculations, and ensuring consistency across different methods, the final answer is:\n\n**Shaina will receive \\(\\frac{12}{5}\\) pounds of chocolate.**",

  "ground_truth": "We need to divide the amount of chocolate Jordan has by the the number of piles, so our expression is $\\frac{48}{5} \\div 4$.  Recall that dividing is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal.  Therefore, $\\frac{48}{5} \\div 4$ is the same thing as $\\frac{48}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}.$ We can rewrite $\\frac{48}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$ as $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 48 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$, or $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{48}{4}$. To simplify this, divide $48$ by $4$, which equals $12$. Our previous expression, $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{48}{4}$, then equals $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 12$, which comes to $\\frac{12}{5}$.  So Shaina will receive $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5}}$ pounds of chocolate."
