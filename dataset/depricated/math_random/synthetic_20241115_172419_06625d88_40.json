    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would as a human solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and make sure to check my work along the way. Here we go!\n\n### **1. Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, the problem asks me to rewrite the quadratic \\(x^2 - 20x + 36\\) in the form \\((x + b)^2 + c\\), where \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are constants. Then, I need to find \\(b + c\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- This looks like completing the square, which I remember is a method used to convert quadratics into perfect square forms. \n- Alternatively, I could expand \\((x + b)^2 + c\\) and compare coefficients with the original quadratic to find \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n- I\u2019m not entirely sure which method will be smoother, so maybe I'll start with completing the square and see how it goes. If it gets messy, I'll switch strategies.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n1. **Completing the Square:**\n   - This method directly transforms the quadratic into the desired form.\n   \n2. **Expanding \\((x + b)^2 + c\\):**\n   - This could help me find \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) by matching coefficients.\n   \n3. **Using the Quadratic Formula:**\n   - Not immediately useful since I\u2019m not solving for roots but transforming the quadratic.\n\n**Reflection:**\nCompleting the square seems straightforward for this type of problem, but expanding might offer a verification step. Let\u2019s start with completing the square.\n\n### **2. Attempting the First Strategy: Completing the Square**\n\n**Step 1: Completing the Square**\n\nTo complete the square for \\(x^2 - 20x + 36\\):\n\n- **Half of the Coefficient of \\(x\\):**\n  - The coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-20\\). Half of \\(-20\\) is \\(-10\\).\n  \n- **Square That Value:**\n  - \\((-10)^2 = 100\\).\n\n- **Rewrite the Quadratic:**\n  - Add and subtract 100 inside the expression to complete the square.\n  \n\\[\nx^2 - 20x + 36 = (x^2 - 20x + 100) - 100 + 36\n\\]\n  \n\\[\n= (x - 10)^2 - 64\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\nDoes this look right? I added and subtracted the same amount to maintain equality. The expression inside the square is now a perfect square.\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, let me quickly check the expansion of \\((x - 10)^2 - 64\\) to ensure it matches the original quadratic.\n\n**Check: Expand \\((x - 10)^2 - 64\\)**\n\n\\[\n(x - 10)^2 = x^2 - 20x + 100\n\\]\n  \n\\[\n(x - 10)^2 - 64 = x^2 - 20x + 100 - 64 = x^2 - 20x + 36\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPerfect! It matches the original quadratic. So, completing the square worked correctly.\n\n### **3. Identifying \\(b\\) and \\(c\\)**\n\n**Step 2: Comparing with \\((x + b)^2 + c\\)**\n\nNow, I have:\n\n\\[\n(x - 10)^2 - 64\n\\]\n\nThis matches the form \\((x + b)^2 + c\\), so:\n\n- \\(b = -10\\)\n- \\(c = -64\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\nHmm, can I double-check this by considering the signs? The original quadratic has \\(-20x\\), and halving \\(-20\\) gives \\(-10\\), which aligns with \\(b\\). Also, the constant term adjusts correctly to \\(-64\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe signs seem correct, and the numbers align. I think this is right, but let\u2019s verify by expanding again.\n\n### **4. Verifying by Expanding \\((x + b)^2 + c\\)**\n\n**Step 3: Expand \\((x + b)^2 + c\\) with \\(b = -10\\) and \\(c = -64\\)**\n\n\\[\n(x - 10)^2 - 64 = x^2 - 20x + 100 - 64 = x^2 - 20x + 36\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWait, I\u2019m expanding it again\u2014does it still match? Yes, it does. This confirms that our values for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\nExpanding again gave the same original quadratic. It\u2019s reassuring that both methods lead to the same result.\n\n### **5. Calculating \\(b + c\\)**\n\n**Step 4: Adding \\(b\\) and \\(c\\)**\n\n\\[\nb + c = -10 + (-64) = -74\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAdding the constants seems straightforward. Always good to double-check if adding negatives aligns with expectations.\n\n**Reflection:**\nNegative 74 makes sense given the values of \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). No issues here.\n\n### **6. Final Verification**\n\n**Step 5: Quick Check**\n\n- **Does \\((x - 10)^2 - 64\\) represent a perfect square minus a constant?**\n  - Yes, it does.\n  \n- **Is \\(b = -10\\) and \\(c = -64\\) aligning with the original quadratic\u2019s coefficients?**\n  - Coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-20\\), and half of that is \\(-10\\); constant adjusts to \\(-64\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The approach was correct, and the calculations align with the original quadratic.\n\n### **7. Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thought:**\nBy completing the square, I transformed the quadratic \\(x^2 - 20x + 36\\) into \\((x - 10)^2 - 64\\), identifying \\(b = -10\\) and \\(c = -64\\). Therefore, \\(b + c = -74\\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nCompleting the square was a straightforward method here, and verifying by expansion ensured accuracy. Exploring different strategies initially helped confirm that this was the most efficient approach.\n\n---\n\nAnd there you have it! The detailed, step-by-step thought process mimicking human problem-solving, complete with brainstorming, reflections, checks, and a final conclusion.",
