    "working_out": "Sure! Let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work as I go, just like I would if I were solving it manually. Let's begin by understanding the question thoroughly.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The problem asks for the minimum value of \\( z \\) given the expression \\( z = x^2 + 2y^2 + 6x - 4y + 22 \\).\n- I recognize that this is a quadratic expression in terms of both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Quadratics often have minimum or maximum values, so perhaps completing the square or using calculus might help.\n- My initial instinct is to try completing the square because that method often reveals vertex points, which can indicate minimum or maximum values.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Strategy 1:** Complete the square for both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to rewrite the expression in a more manageable form.\n- **Strategy 2:** Use derivatives to find critical points if completing the square doesn't work out easily.\n- **Strategy 3:** Consider evaluating the expression at specific points to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Completing the square seems like a good starting point because it directly relates to finding the vertex of a quadratic, which is where the minimum or maximum occurs.\n- Let's try that and see if it leads us to the solution.\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting Strategy 1 \u2013 Completing the Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I\u2019ll start by grouping the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) terms separately.\n- Then, I\u2019ll complete the square for each variable to see if I can simplify the expression.\n\n**Working:**\n1. **Group the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) terms:**\n   \\[\n   z = (x^2 + 6x) + (2y^2 - 4y) + 22\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Complete the square for \\( x^2 + 6x \\):**\n   - Take half of the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\), and square it: \\( 3^2 = 9 \\).\n   - Add and subtract this square inside the expression:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + 6x = (x^2 + 6x + 9) - 9 = (x + 3)^2 - 9\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Complete the square for \\( 2y^2 - 4y \\):**\n   - Factor out the 2 from the \\( y \\) terms:\n     \\[\n     2(y^2 - 2y)\n     \\]\n   - Take half of the coefficient of \\( y \\), which is \\( -2 \\), and square it: \\( (-1)^2 = 1 \\).\n   - Add and subtract this square inside:\n     \\[\n     2(y^2 - 2y + 1 - 1) = 2((y - 1)^2 - 1) = 2(y - 1)^2 - 2\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Rewrite \\( z \\) with completed squares:**\n   \\[\n   z = [(x + 3)^2 - 9] + [2(y - 1)^2 - 2] + 22\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Simplify the expression:**\n   \\[\n   z = (x + 3)^2 + 2(y - 1)^2 - 9 - 2 + 22\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   z = (x + 3)^2 + 2(y - 1)^2 + 11\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n- Now the expression is in terms of squared quantities, which is great because squares are always non-negative. This suggests that the minimum value occurs when both squared terms are zero.\n- **Quick Check:** Does this look correct? Yes, because completing the square should yield an expression that clearly shows the vertex.\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Minimum Value**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- From the completed square form, it's evident that \\( z \\) is minimized when both \\( (x + 3)^2 \\) and \\( 2(y - 1)^2 \\) are zero.\n- I need to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that make these terms zero.\n\n**Working:**\n1. **Set \\( (x + 3)^2 = 0 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x + 3 = 0 \\implies x = -3\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set \\( 2(y - 1)^2 = 0 \\):**\n   \\[\n   (y - 1)^2 = 0 \\implies y = 1\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Substitute \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\) back into the expression:**\n   \\[\n   z = (-3 + 3)^2 + 2(1 - 1)^2 + 11 = 0 + 0 + 11 = 11\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because setting the squared terms to zero minimizes \\( z \\). The minimum value is \\( 11 \\).\n- **Quick Check:** The calculation seems straightforward, and the logic behind completing the square aligns with finding minimum values in quadratics.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before concluding, it's essential to verify that no other approach gives a different minimum value and that the calculations are correct.\n\n**Working:**\n- **Check Alternative Strategy:** Consider using derivatives to confirm the minimum.\n- **Derivative Approach:**\n  - Since \\( z \\) is a function of two variables, find partial derivatives with respect to \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), set them to zero to find critical points.\n  \n1. **Partial derivative with respect to \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = 2x + 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x + 6 = 0 \\implies x = -3\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Partial derivative with respect to \\( y \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} = 4y - 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4y - 4 = 0 \\implies y = 1\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Second derivatives to confirm it's a minimum:**\n   - Compute the Hessian determinant:\n     \\[\n     H = \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial x^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial y^2} - \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\right)^2\n     \\]\n   - Calculate second derivatives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial x^2} = 2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial y^2} = 4, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0\n     \\]\n   - Compute \\( H \\):\n     \\[\n     H = 2 \\times 4 - 0^2 = 8 > 0\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( H > 0 \\) and \\( \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial x^2} > 0 \\), it confirms a local minimum.\n   \n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Using derivatives confirms the critical point identified by completing the square leads to a minimum.\n- **Mistake Check:** No errors found in calculations; both methods agree on the minimum value.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, completing the square proved to be the most straightforward method, aligning with derivative analysis for verification. The minimum value of \\( z \\) is **11**, occurring at \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- **Brainstorming Helped:** Initially, considering multiple strategies allowed me to choose the most efficient one.\n- **Continuous Checking:** Regular checks ensured the approach was correct and led to the desired solution.\n- **Adaptability:** Being open to switching methods ensured accuracy, especially when the initial approach needed confirmation through an alternative strategy.",

  "ground_truth": "First, complete the square as follows: $$z=x^2+2y^2+6x-4y+22=\\left(x^2+6x\\right)+2\\left(y^2-2y\\right)+22.$$To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{6}{2}\\right)^2=9$ after the $6x$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ after the $-2y.$ So we have $$z+9+2(1)=\\left(x^2+6x+9\\right)+2\\left(y^2-2y+1\\right)+22.$$This gives $$z=\\left(x+3\\right)^2+2\\left(y-1\\right)^2+11.$$Now, since $\\left(x+3\\right)^2\\ge0$ and $\\left(y-1\\right)^2\\ge0,$ the minimum value is when both squared terms are equal to $0.$ So the minimum value is $$z=\\left(x+3\\right)^2+2\\left(y-1\\right)^2+11=0+2\\cdot0+11=\\boxed{11}.$$"
