    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were solving it myself. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn\u2019t seem right. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst Thoughts:  \nOkay, the problem is asking for the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sin^4 x + \\cos^2 x \\) as \\( x \\) varies over all real numbers. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a combination of sine and cosine powers. I vaguely remember dealing with trigonometric identities and perhaps using the Pythagorean identity somewhere.\n\n- **Possible Strategies Coming to Mind:**\n  1. **Use Trigonometric Identities:** Maybe I can simplify \\( \\sin^4 x \\) using the identity \\( \\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1 \\).\n  2. **Consider Maximum and Minimum Values:** Since sine and cosine have known ranges, perhaps I can find the extrema of the function.\n  3. **Graphical Approach:** Plotting the function might help visualize its range.\n  4. **Substitution Method:** Substitute \\( \\cos^2 x = u \\) and see if that simplifies things.\n\nOkay, let's start with the first strategy: **Using Trigonometric Identities**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Trigonometric Identities**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI know that \\( \\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1 \\). Maybe I can express \\( \\sin^4 x \\) in terms of \\( \\cos^2 x \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Recall that:\n  \\[\n  \\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x\n  \\]\n  \n- Therefore,\n  \\[\n  \\sin^4 x = (\\sin^2 x)^2 = (1 - \\cos^2 x)^2\n  \\]\n  \n- Expanding \\( (1 - \\cos^2 x)^2 \\):\n  \\[\n  \\sin^4 x = 1 - 2\\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x\n  \\]\n  \n- Now, substitute this back into \\( f(x) \\):\n  \\[\n  f(x) = \\sin^4 x + \\cos^2 x = (1 - 2\\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x) + \\cos^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:**  \nWait a minute. This simplification seems messy. Adding \\( \\cos^2 x \\) and \\( \\cos^4 x \\) doesn\u2019t look straightforward for finding the range. Maybe there's a better way.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, perhaps this isn't the most intuitive path. Let me see if there's another strategy that might work better.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Maximum and Minimum Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSine and cosine functions have maximum values of 1 and minimum values of -1. Maybe I can calculate the maximum and minimum of \\( f(x) \\) based on these.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Since \\( \\cos^2 x \\) ranges from 0 to 1 (because \\( \\cos x \\) ranges from -1 to 1), let's see how \\( f(x) = 1 - \\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x \\) behaves within this range.\n\n- Let \\( u = \\cos^2 x \\), so \\( u \\) ranges from 0 to 1.\n\n- Then, \\( f(x) = 1 - u + u^2 \\).\n\n- **Find the range of \\( g(u) = 1 - u + u^2 \\) where \\( u \\in [0, 1] \\):**\n\n  - Calculate the derivative to find critical points:\n    \\[\n    g'(u) = -1 + 2u\n    \\]\n    \n  - Set the derivative to zero to find critical points:\n    \\[\n    -1 + 2u = 0 \\implies u = \\frac{1}{2}\n    \\]\n    \n  - **Evaluate \\( g(u) \\) at the endpoints and the critical point:**\n    \n    - At \\( u = 0 \\):\n      \\[\n      g(0) = 1 - 0 + 0^2 = 1\n      \\]\n    \n    - At \\( u = 1 \\):\n      \\[\n      g(1) = 1 - 1 + 1^2 = 1\n      \\]\n    \n    - At \\( u = \\frac{1}{2} \\):\n      \\[\n      g\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\n      \\]\n    \n  - **So, the range of \\( g(u) \\) is [\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), 1].**\n\n**Check:**  \nThis seems reasonable. The function \\( g(u) = 1 - u + u^2 \\) is a quadratic opening upwards, and we've found its minimum and maximum within the interval [0, 1].\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI think this approach is correct. By substituting \\( \\cos^2 x \\) with \\( u \\) and analyzing the quadratic function, I've found the range.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with a Graphical Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo ensure correctness, it might be helpful to visualize \\( f(x) \\) by plotting it or considering its behavior graphically.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Recall that \\( f(x) = \\sin^4 x + \\cos^2 x \\).\n  \n- Note that both \\( \\sin^4 x \\) and \\( \\cos^2 x \\) are non-negative and periodic functions.\n  \n- The function combines these two, with \\( \\cos^2 x \\) contributing additively.\n  \n- **Key Observations:**\n  - \\( \\sin^4 x \\) varies between 0 and 1, reaching 0 when \\( \\sin x = 0 \\) (i.e., \\( x = n\\pi \\)) and 1 when \\( \\sin x = \\pm 1 \\) (i.e., \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi \\)).\n  - \\( \\cos^2 x \\) also varies between 0 and 1, reaching 0 when \\( \\cos x = 0 \\) (i.e., \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi \\)) and 1 when \\( \\cos x = \\pm 1 \\) (i.e., \\( x = n\\pi \\)).\n  \n- **Behavior at Key Points:**\n  - At \\( x = n\\pi \\):\n    \\[\n    f(n\\pi) = \\sin^4(n\\pi) + \\cos^2(n\\pi) = 0 + 1 = 1\n    \\]\n    \n  - At \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi \\):\n    \\[\n    f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\\right) = \\sin^4\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\\right) + \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\\right) = 1 + 0 = 1\n    \\]\n    \n  - At \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + n\\pi \\):\n    \\[\n    f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + n\\pi\\right) = \\sin^4\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + n\\pi\\right) + \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + n\\pi\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^4 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}\n    \\]\n    \n- **Conclusion from Graphing:**  \n  The function oscillates between \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) and 1, confirming that the range is indeed [\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), 1].\n\n**Check:**  \nThis graphical approach backs up the earlier calculation, ensuring the range is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI feel confident now that the range is [\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), 1]. Both algebraic and graphical methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Presenting the Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, checking calculations, and verifying with a graphical approach, I've determined that the range of \\( f(x) = \\sin^4 x + \\cos^2 x \\) as \\( x \\) ranges over all real numbers is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{[\\frac{3}{4}, 1]}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBy starting with trigonometric identities and then considering the quadratic nature of the function, I was able to find the range methodically. Cross-checking with a graphical approach added certainty to the result. It's always good practice to explore multiple strategies and verify findings to ensure accuracy, especially in trigonometric problems.",
