I think that involves prime factorization and perhaps using the formula for the sum of divisors.\n- **Uncertainty**: I'm not entirely sure how to proceed after finding the sum. Maybe I need to factor \\( N \\) to find its largest prime component.\n- **Exploration**: Should I start with prime factorization of \\( 200 \\)? Or is there another method to find the sum of divisors directly?\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Prime Factorization Method**: Factor \\( 200 \\) into its prime components, then use a formula to find the sum of divisors.\n2. **Divisor Function Formula**: Use the known formula for the sum of divisors based on prime factorization.\n3. **Listing Divisors Manually**: Although feasible for smaller numbers, \\( 200 \\) might be cumbersome this way, but it's an option to verify other methods.\n\n**Reflection**: I think starting with prime factorization makes sense because it streamlines finding the sum of divisors using a formula. Listing all divisors manually could serve as a check but might be time-consuming.\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization of \\( 200 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s break down \\( 200 \\) into its prime factors. This will help in applying the sum of divisors formula later.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Start with the smallest prime, \\( 2 \\):\n  \\[\n  200 \\div 2 = 100\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  100 \\div 2 = 50\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  50 \\div 2 = 25\n  \\]\n- Now, \\( 25 \\) is no longer divisible by \\( 2 \\), so try the next prime, \\( 3 \\) (not divisible).\n- Move to \\( 5 \\):\n  \\[\n  25 \\div 5 = 5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  5 \\div 5 = 1\n  \\]\n  \n**Result:**\nSo, the prime factorization of \\( 200 \\) is:\n\\[\n200 = 2^3 \\times 5^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems correct because multiplying back \\( 2^3 (8) \\times 5^2 (25) = 200 \\).\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Sum of Divisors Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWith the prime factorization in hand, I can use the formula for the sum of divisors. The formula is:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = (p_1^{k_1 + 1} - 1)(p_2^{k_2 + 1} - 1) \\times \\frac{1}{(p_1 - 1)(p_2 - 1)}\n\\]\nwhere \\( n = p_1^{k_1} \\times p_2^{k_2} \\times \\ldots \\). But I remember there's a simpler version for multiple primes:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\ldots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + \\ldots + p_2^{k_2}) \\times \\ldots\n\\]\nSo, for \\( 200 = 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\), it becomes:\n\\[\n\\sigma(200) = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 5 + 25)\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n- First part:\n  \\[\n  1 + 2 = 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3 + 4 = 7\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  7 + 8 = 15\n  \\]\n- Second part:\n  \\[\n  1 + 5 = 6\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  6 + 25 = 31\n  \\]\n- Multiply both parts:\n  \\[\n  15 \\times 31 = 465\n  \\]\n\n**Result:**\n\\[\nN = \\sigma(200) = 465\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a moment\u2014let me double-check that multiplication:\n\\[\n15 \\times 31 = 15 \\times (30 + 1) = 15 \\times 30 + 15 \\times 1 = 450 + 15 = 465\n\\]\nYes, this checks out.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying by Listing Divisors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure the sum of divisors calculation is correct, I'll list all divisors of \\( 200 \\) and sum them up. This serves as a verification step.\n\n**Calculation:**\nList of divisors:\n- \\( 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 200 \\)\n\nSum:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 40 + 50 + 100 + 200 = 465\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe sum matches our earlier calculation. This verifies that \\( N = 465 \\) is correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying the Largest Prime Factor of \\( N \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I know \\( N = 465 \\), the next step is to find its largest prime factor. I can do this by prime factorization of \\( 465 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Start with the smallest prime, \\( 2 \\): \\( 465 \\div 2 = 232.5 \\) (not divisible).\n- Try \\( 3 \\):\n  \\[\n  465 \\div 3 = 155 \\quad (\\text{since } 4 + 6 + 5 = 15, \\text{ which is divisible by } 3)\n  \\]\n- Next, factor \\( 155 \\):\n  \\[\n  155 \\div 5 = 31\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  31 \\div 31 = 1\n  \\]\n  \n**Result:**\n\\[\n465 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 31\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the prime factors of \\( 465 \\) are \\( 3, 5, \\) and \\( 31 \\). Among these, the largest prime factor is \\( 31 \\).\n\n### **Step 5: Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s ensure that the prime factorization of \\( N \\) is correct and that \\( 31 \\) is indeed the largest prime factor.\n\n**Verification:**\n- Reconfirm prime factorization of \\( 465 \\):\n  \\[\n  465 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 31\n  \\]\n- Check multiplication:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 5 = 15\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  15 \\times 31 = 465\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The prime factorization is correct, and the largest prime factor of \\( 465 \\) is indeed \\( 31 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe largest prime factor of \\( N \\), where \\( N \\) is the sum of the divisors of \\( 200 \\), is **31**.\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem step by step, verifying each part of the process, and reflecting frequently, I've ensured that the solution is accurate and comprehensive.",
