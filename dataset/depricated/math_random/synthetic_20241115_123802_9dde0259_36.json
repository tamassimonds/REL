If the length of the field is twice the width, what is the area of the field, in square feet?*\n\nImmediately, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Perimeter of a Rectangle:** I remember the formula for the perimeter \\( P = 2(L + W) \\), where \\( L \\) is the length and \\( W \\) is the width. So, the total perimeter is related to both dimensions.\n   \n2. **Relationship Between Length and Width:** The problem states that the length is twice the width, which gives me a direct relationship to work with.\n\n3. **Finding Area:** Once I determine the length and width, computing the area is straightforward using \\( A = L \\times W \\).\n\nBut I'm slightly uncertain\u2014how should I set up my equations to find both dimensions efficiently? Perhaps I can use substitution since I have a relationship between \\( L \\) and \\( W \\).\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\nLet\u2019s brainstorm different ways to approach this:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Set up two equations based on perimeter and the relationship between length and width, then solve them simultaneously.\n\n2. **Expressing One Variable in Terms of Another:** Since length is twice the width, I could express \\( L \\) as \\( 2W \\) and substitute it into the perimeter equation.\n\n3. **Using Proportions:** Considering the relationship between length and width, perhaps proportions could simplify the calculations.\n\nInitially, the **System of Equations** method seems straightforward, but I'm worried it might get messy. On the other hand, **substituting \\( L = 2W \\)** into the perimeter equation might streamline things. Let's try that.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equations**\n\nI\u2019ll start by writing down the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2(L + W) = 60 \\]\n\nGiven that the length is twice the width:\n\n\\[ L = 2W \\]\n\nReflection: Does this make sense? Yes, because substituting \\( L = 2W \\) into the perimeter equation should allow me to solve for \\( W \\) directly.\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting the Relationship into the Perimeter Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\( L = 2W \\) into the perimeter equation:\n\n\\[ 2(2W + W) = 60 \\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[ 2(3W) = 60 \\]\n\\[ 6W = 60 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 6 to solve for \\( W \\):\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{60}{6} = 10 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nWait, that seems too neat\u2014let me double-check. Hmm, dividing 60 by 6 does indeed give 10, which is plausible. But let\u2019s make sure by reflecting: if the width is 10 feet, then the length should be \\( 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\) feet, making the perimeter add up correctly.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Length**\n\nNow that we have the width, let\u2019s find the length:\n\n\\[ L = 2W = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nQuick Check: The length being twice the width makes sense. So, I\u2019m confident in these values.\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Area of the Garden**\n\nWith both dimensions known, computing the area is straightforward:\n\n\\[ A = L \\times W = 20 \\times 10 = 200 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nReflection: This area seems reasonable given the dimensions. Let me quickly verify if the perimeter checks out with these dimensions:\n\n\\[ P = 2(L + W) = 2(20 + 10) = 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nPerfect! The perimeter matches the given value, confirming our calculations are correct.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nLet\u2019s recap the thought process:\n\n- **Identified Key Formulas:** Recognized the perimeter formula for a rectangle and the relationship between length and width.\n  \n- **Chosen Strategy:** Opted to substitute the relationship \\( L = 2W \\) into the perimeter equation to solve for \\( W \\).\n\n- **Performed Calculations:** Solved for the width, then calculated the length, and finally found the area.\n\n- **Checked Work:** Verified that the perimeter matched with the calculated dimensions, ensuring the correctness of the approach.\n\nThroughout the process, I kept reflecting and checking each step to ensure nothing went awry. Initially, it seemed straightforward, but I made sure to verify each part to avoid any miscalculations.\n\n**Final Answer:** The area of the garden is **200 square feet**.",

  "ground_truth": "If the length is $l$ and the width is $w$, then the perimeter is $2l+2w$. We can set up the equations $2l+2w=60 \\Rightarrow l+w=30$ and $l=2w$. Now we substitute $l$ in terms of $w$ into the first equation and get $l+w=2w+w=30$, so $w=10$ and $l=2(10)=20$. That means the area of the rectangular garden is $lw=20(10)=\\boxed{200}$ square feet."
