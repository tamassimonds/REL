    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it step by step, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking if my ideas make sense, and adjusting my methods as needed. \n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** There's a line segment starting at \\((1, 3)\\) and ending at \\((4, x)\\) with a length of 5 units. I need to find \\(x\\) where \\(x > 0\\).\n  \n- **Brainstorming Options:**\n  - **Distance Formula:** This reminds me of the distance formula in geometry. It calculates the distance between two points. That seems directly applicable here.\n  - **Pythagorean Theorem:** Since we're dealing with a line segment between two points on a Cartesian plane, perhaps the Pythagorean theorem could help.\n  - **Coordinate Differences:** I could explore the differences between the coordinates to see which relationships I can utilize.\n\nAt this point, the **Distance Formula** seems like the most straightforward approach because I'm dealing directly with the length between two given points. \n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Distance Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Recall the Formula:** The distance \\(d\\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n  \\[\n  d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Given Points:** \n  - Start: \\((1, 3)\\)\n  - End: \\((4, x)\\)\n\n- **Set Up Equation:** Since the length of the line segment is 5 units, I can set up the equation:\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (x - 3)^2} = 5\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Simplify Inside the Square Root:**\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{3^2 + (x - 3)^2} = 5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{9 + (x - 3)^2} = 5\n  \\]\n\n- **Square Both Sides to Eliminate the Square Root:**\n  \\[\n  9 + (x - 3)^2 = 25\n  \\]\n  \n- **Subtract 9 from Both Sides:**\n  \\[\n  (x - 3)^2 = 16\n  \\]\n\n- **Take the Square Root of Both Sides:**\n  \\[\n  x - 3 = \\pm 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n  \\[\n  x - 3 = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 7\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x - 3 = -4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -1\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Checking the Solutions:** I have two potential solutions for \\(x\\): 7 and -1. However, the problem specifies \\(x > 0\\), so \\(x = -1\\) doesn't satisfy this condition.\n\n- **Final Value:** Thus, \\(x = 7\\) is the only valid solution.\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Let's quickly verify if the distance indeed equals 5 units when \\(x = 7\\).\n\n- **Calculate Distance with \\(x = 7\\):**\n  \\[\n  d = \\sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (7 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n  \\]\n  \n- **Does It Match?** Yes, the distance is exactly 5 units, which aligns with the problem's requirement.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Solution Validation:** This confirms that \\(x = 7\\) is correct.\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring an Alternative Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Considering Pythagorean Theorem:** Since the distance formula is essentially an application of the Pythagorean theorem, I could approach it from that angle to see if it yields the same result.\n\n- **Setting Up the Equation Again:**\n  \\[\n  (x - 3)^2 + 3^2 = 5^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (x - 3)^2 + 9 = 25\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (x - 3)^2 = 16\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x - 3 = \\pm 4\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = 7 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -1\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Comparison:** The alternative method also leads to the same solutions: \\(x = 7\\) and \\(x = -1\\). \n\n- **Consistency Check:** Both methods are consistent, reinforcing that \\(x = 7\\) is indeed the correct answer.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Approach Effectiveness:** Starting with the distance formula was effective and straightforward. Exploring the Pythagorean theorem as an alternative confirmed the solution.\n\n- **Mistakes:** Initially, I didn't consider checking both potential solutions (\\(x = 7\\) and \\(x = -1\\)), but reflecting on the condition \\(x > 0\\) helped narrow it down correctly.\n\n- **Key Takeaway:** Always verify the conditions given in the problem to discard any extraneous solutions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The value of \\(x\\) is **7**.",

  "ground_truth": "We use the distance formula: $$\\sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (x - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + (x - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 - 6x + 18} = 5.$$ Squaring both sides and rearranging terms, we find that \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 6x + 18 &= 25 \\\\\nx^2 - 6x - 7 &= 0\\\\\n(x - 7)(x + 1) &= 0\n\\end{align*} Thus, $x = 7$ or $x = -1$. We are given that $x > 0$, so $x = \\boxed{7}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nNote that the points $(1, 3)$, $(4, 3)$, and $(4, x)$ form a right triangle. We are given that one of the legs has length 3 and the hypotenuse has length 5. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the last leg must have length 4. Therefore, $x = 3 - 4 = -1$ or $x = 3 + 4 = 7$. Since $x > 0$, we find that $x = \\boxed{7}$."
