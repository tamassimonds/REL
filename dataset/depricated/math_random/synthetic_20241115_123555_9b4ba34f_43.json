I\u2019ll start by understanding the question, exploring different strategies, checking if they work, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let\u2019s mimic the natural thought process, including brainstorming, reflecting, and verifying our solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem:\n\n- **Operation Defined:** For any real numbers \\( a \\neq b \\), the operation \\( \\star \\) is defined as \n  \\[\n  (a \\star b) = \\frac{a + b}{a - b}.\n  \\]\n  \n- **Objective:** Find the value of \\( ((1 \\star 2) \\star 3) \\).\n\nInitially, I\u2019m thinking:\n\n- **What is \\( \\star \\)?** This operation seems similar to calculating slopes or inverses. It involves addition in the numerator and subtraction in the denominator.\n  \n- **Sequential Operations:** The expression involves nested operations. First, compute \\( 1 \\star 2 \\), then take that result and \\( \\star \\) it with 3. This reminds me of handling parentheses in arithmetic\u2014always deal with the innermost operation first.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Direct Calculation:** Perform each operation step-by-step as defined.\n  2. **Simplification or Patterns:** See if there's a pattern or simplification that can generalize the operation.\n  3. **Check for Inverses:** Perhaps explore if this operation has an inverse that can simplify calculations.\n\nAt this point, I think the most straightforward approach is to **directly calculate** each step. But I\u2019m open to checking if a different strategy might simplify things.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating \\( 1 \\star 2 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Operation Definition:** According to the definition, \n  \\[\n  1 \\star 2 = \\frac{1 + 2}{1 - 2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  1 + 2 = 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  1 - 2 = -1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\Rightarrow 1 \\star 2 = \\frac{3}{-1} = -3\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Wait, the denominator is negative, so the result is negative. That makes sense since adding 1 and 2 gives 3, and subtracting 2 from 1 gives -1. Dividing 3 by -1 correctly yields -3.\n\n- **Verdict:** This seems correct. The calculation aligns with the operation's definition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating \\( (-3) \\star 3 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Operation Definition:** Now, we need to compute \n  \\[\n  (-3) \\star 3 = \\frac{-3 + 3}{-3 - 3}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  -3 + 3 = 0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -3 - 3 = -6\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\Rightarrow (-3) \\star 3 = \\frac{0}{-6} = 0\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** The numerator is 0, and the denominator is -6. Dividing zero by any non-zero number should give zero. That\u2019s consistent with mathematical principles.\n\n- **Verdict:** This looks correct. The operation behaves as expected, yielding 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Process**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Sequential Operations:** I followed the order of operations as defined by the expression\u2014first calculating \\( 1 \\star 2 \\), then using that result to compute \\( (-3) \\star 3 \\).\n\n- **Consistency Check:** Each step adheres to the operation\u2019s definition. The calculations flow logically from one step to the next.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does the Result Make Sense?** The final result is 0. Given that one part of the operation resulted in -3, and now it\u2019s being combined with 3 (where the numerator becomes 0), getting 0 seems reasonable.\n\n- **Error Check:** No red flags pop up. The calculations are straightforward, and the results align with the operation's rules.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Exploring Patterns**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Maybe there\u2019s a pattern or property in the \\( \\star \\) operation that can simplify calculations. For instance, could \\( a \\star a \\) always be 0?\n\n- **Testing \\( a \\star a \\):**\n  \\[\n  a \\star a = \\frac{a + a}{a - a} = \\frac{2a}{0}\n  \\]\n  - **Observation:** This is undefined because division by zero isn\u2019t allowed.\n\n- **Reflection:** So, \\( a \\star a \\) is undefined. That\u2019s interesting but doesn\u2019t directly help with our specific problem.\n\n- **Verdict:** Since exploring \\( a \\star a \\) doesn\u2019t provide immediate insights, I\u2019ll stick with the direct calculation approach, which has proven effective so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully following the definition of the operation and verifying each step, the value of \\( ((1 \\star 2) \\star 3) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** The direct calculation method worked well here. Each step was clear, and the results followed logically.\n\n- **Alternative Approaches:** Exploring alternative strategies like examining \\( a \\star a \\) didn\u2019t yield shortcuts but contributed to understanding the operation\u2019s properties.\n\n- **Mistake Check:** No mistakes were detected throughout the process. Each calculation aligned with the operation\u2019s definition.\n\n- **Human-Like Thinking:** Throughout, I brainstormed different strategies, reflected on whether each step made sense, and verified the correctness of the results before proceeding.\n\nIn summary, tackling the problem step-by-step, checking and reflecting on each part of the process, led to a clear and accurate solution.",
