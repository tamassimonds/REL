    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just as I would if I were solving it on paper, exploring different strategies, checking my work, and reflecting along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so I'm given a geometric sequence where the first term is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and the second term is \\(15\\). I need to find the smallest \\(n\\) such that the \\(n\\)th term is divisible by one million.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Geometric Sequence Basics:** I remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a constant called the common ratio to get the next term. So, if I know the first two terms, I can find the common ratio.\n\n- **Finding the Common Ratio:** I could use the given terms to find this common ratio.\n\n- **General Formula for Terms:** Once I have the common ratio, I can write the formula for the \\(n\\)th term.\n\n- **Divisibility by One Million:** To check if the \\(n\\)th term is divisible by one million, I might need to factor one million and see how the terms align with these factors.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Find the Common Ratio and Write the \\(n\\)th Term Formula:**\n   - This seems straightforward. Find the common ratio and use it to write the general term.\n\n2. **Check Divisibility by One Million:**\n   - Once I have the formula, see when it becomes divisible by one million.\n\n3. **Consider Factorization Approach:**\n   - Factor one million and see if the exponents in the term align with these factors.\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\nBut before jumping in, let me reflect. **Is there any easier way to approach this?** Maybe I can see patterns or leverage properties of exponents and divisibility right away.\n\nI think I'll start with finding the common ratio and writing the general term. If that seems too complex or doesn't work out, I can reconsider my approach.\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Common Ratio**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the common ratio (\\(r\\)) of the geometric sequence, I remember that the second term is obtained by multiplying the first term by \\(r\\).\n\n\\[\na_1 = \\frac{3}{4}, \\quad a_2 = 15\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\na_2 = a_1 \\times r \\implies r = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{15}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 15 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat seems to make sense. Multiplying \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) by \\(20\\) gives \\(15\\), which matches the second term.\n\n### **Step 2: Writing the Formula for the \\(n\\)th Term**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIn a geometric sequence, the \\(n\\)th term (\\(a_n\\)) can be written as:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 \\times r^{n-1}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n\\[\na_n = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 20^{n-1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so now I have the formula for the \\(n\\)th term. It\u2019s dependent on \\(20^{n-1}\\). I need to check when this term is divisible by one million.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing Divisibility by One Million**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nOne million is \\(10^6 = (2 \\times 5)^6 = 2^6 \\times 5^6\\). For \\(a_n\\) to be divisible by one million, it must have at least six 2s and six 5s in its prime factorization.\n\nLooking at \\(a_n = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 20^{n-1}\\):\n\n- \\(\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{2^2}\\), so it has two 2s in the denominator.\n- \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5\\), so \\(20^{n-1} = (2^2 \\times 5)^{n-1} = 2^{2(n-1)} \\times 5^{n-1}\\).\n\nNow, let's combine these:\n\n\\[\na_n = \\frac{3}{2^2} \\times 2^{2(n-1)} \\times 5^{n-1} = 3 \\times 2^{2(n-1) - 2} \\times 5^{n-1}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponent of 2:\n\n\\[\n2(n-1) - 2 = 2n - 2 - 2 = 2n - 4\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\na_n = 3 \\times 2^{2n - 4} \\times 5^{n-1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, let me double-check this exponent part. \n\n- Wait, does \\(2(n-1)\\) really minus \\(2\\) give \\(2n - 4\\)? \n\n  Yes, because:\n  \n  \\[\n  2(n-1) = 2n - 2\n  \\]\n  \n  And subtracting \\(2\\):\n  \n  \\[\n  2n - 2 - 2 = 2n - 4\n  \\]\n\nAlright, that seems correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Determining the Smallest \\(n\\) for Divisibility**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to determine the smallest \\(n\\) such that:\n\n\\[\n2^{2n - 4} \\times 5^{n-1} \\text{ has at least } 2^6 \\text{ and } 5^6\n\\]\n\nThis means:\n\n1. **For the factor of 2:**\n\n   \\[\n   2n - 4 \\geq 6\n   \\]\n   \n   Solving for \\(n\\):\n   \n   \\[\n   2n \\geq 6 + 4 = 10 \\implies n \\geq 5\n   \\]\n   \n2. **For the factor of 5:**\n\n   \\[\n   n - 1 \\geq 6 \\implies n \\geq 7\n   \\]\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**\n\nI have two conditions: \\(n \\geq 5\\) for the factor of 2 and \\(n \\geq 7\\) for the factor of 5. The smallest \\(n\\) that satisfies both is \\(n = 7\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes it make sense? Let's check:\n\n- **At \\(n = 7\\):**\n  - For 2s: \\(2n - 4 = 2(7) - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10\\) (which is \u2265 6)\n  - For 5s: \\(n - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6\\) (which is = 6)\n\nPerfect! Both conditions are met.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe smallest \\(n\\) for which the \\(n\\)th term of the sequence is divisible by one million is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** All steps align with the requirements. At \\(n = 7\\), the exponents in the prime factorization of \\(a_n\\) meet the divisibility criteria for one million.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Initially considered checking specific terms for divisibility but realize that analyzing the exponents was more efficient.\n\n- **Learning:** Breaking down the problem into factors and ensuring each condition is met is crucial in such divisibility problems.\n\n- **Mistake Prevention:** By checking both factors (2s and 5s) separately, I avoided missing any condition that could lead to an incorrect \\(n\\).\n\nOverall, this step-by-step approach helped ensure the correctness of the solution by continuously reflecting and checking each part of the process.",

  "ground_truth": "The common ratio is $$\\frac{15}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 20$$Therefore, the $n$th term is $(20^{n-1}) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)$.\n\n\nIf one million (aka $10^6$) divides the $n$th term, then it must be divisible by $5^6$. This can only happen if $n-1$ is at least $6$, or $n \\ge 7$.\n\n\nThe $7$th term is $$\\left(20^6\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\left(4\\right)^6\\left(5\\right)^6\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = (2)^{10}(5)^6(3),$$which is divisible by $(2)^6(5)^6=10^6$, so the answer is indeed $\\boxed{7}$."
