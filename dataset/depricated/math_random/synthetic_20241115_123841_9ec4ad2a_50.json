I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see the problem, **\u201cIf the seven-digit number \\(854n526\\) is divisible by \\(11\\), what is \\(n\\)?\u201d**, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Divisibility Rules:** I remember that there's a specific rule for checking divisibility by \\(11\\). This might be useful here.\n   \n2. **Solving for \\(n\\):** The number has a variable \\(n\\), so we'll need to find a digit that makes the whole number divisible by \\(11\\).\n\n3. **Single-Digit \\(n\\):** Since \\(n\\) is a digit, it can only be between \\(0\\) and \\(9\\).\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure if just applying the divisibility rule will be enough. Let me explore different strategies to see which one works best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Apply the Divisibility Rule for \\(11\\):**\n   - I remember that for a number to be divisible by \\(11\\), the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions must be divisible by \\(11\\).\n\n2. **Try Different Values of \\(n\\):**\n   - Since \\(n\\) is a single digit, I could plug in values from \\(0\\) to \\(9\\) and see which one satisfies the divisibility condition.\n\n3. **Look for Patterns:**\n   - Maybe there's a pattern in the existing digits that can help narrow down the possible values for \\(n\\).\n\n4. **Check the Position of \\(n\\):**\n   - Since \\(n\\) is in the third position, its impact on the odd/even sums is specific. Perhaps leveraging this can simplify calculations.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the **Divisibility Rule for \\(11\\)**, as it seems the most straightforward theoretically.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Divisibility Rule for \\(11\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI recall that to check if a number is divisible by \\(11\\), we need to find the difference between the sum of the digits in odd positions and the sum of the digits in even positions. This difference should be divisible by \\(11\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Odd Positions:** \\(8\\) (1st), \\(4\\) (3rd), \\(5\\) (5th), and \\(6\\) (7th)\n  \n  \\[\n  8 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 23\n  \\]\n  \n- **Even Positions:** \\(5\\) (2nd), \\(n\\) (4th), \\(2\\) (6th)\n  \n  \\[\n  5 + n + 2 = 7 + n\n  \\]\n  \n- **Difference:**\n  \n  \\[\n  23 - (7 + n) = 16 - n\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nOkay, so the difference between the sums is \\(16 - n\\). For the number to be divisible by \\(11\\), \\(16 - n\\) must be divisible by \\(11\\).\n\n**Checking Quick Cases:**\nLet me think about it quickly. If \\(n = 5\\):\n\n\\[\n16 - 5 = 11\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(11\\) is divisible by \\(11\\). This might be our answer, but let's verify with other strategies to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying by Trying Different Values of \\(n\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo confirm our finding, let's test other values of \\(n\\) to see if they also work. This will help me ensure that \\(n = 5\\) is indeed correct.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **If \\(n = 0\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  16 - 0 = 16 \\quad (\\text{Not divisible by } 11)\n  \\]\n  \n- **If \\(n = 1\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  16 - 1 = 15 \\quad (\\text{Not divisible by } 11)\n  \\]\n  \n- **If \\(n = 2\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  16 - 2 = 14 \\quad (\\text{Not divisible by } 11)\n  \\]\n  \n- **If \\(n = 3\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  16 - 3 = 13 \\quad (\\text{Not divisible by } 11)\n  \\]\n  \n- **If \\(n = 4\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  16 - 4 = 12 \\quad (\\text{Not divisible by } 11)\n  \\]\n  \n- **If \\(n = 5\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  16 - 5 = 11 \\quad (\\text{Divisible by } 11)\n  \\]\n  \n- **If \\(n = 6\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  16 - 6 = 10 \\quad (\\text{Not divisible by } 11)\n  \\]\n  \n- **If \\(n = 7\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  16 - 7 = 9 \\quad (\\text{Not divisible by } 11)\n  \\]\n  \n- **If \\(n = 8\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  16 - 8 = 8 \\quad (\\text{Not divisible by } 11)\n  \\]\n  \n- **If \\(n = 9\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  16 - 9 = 7 \\quad (\\text{Not divisible by } 11)\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nOnly \\(n = 5\\) makes the difference \\(11\\), which is divisible by \\(11\\). This reinforces our initial finding.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Cross-Checking with the Divisibility Rule**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nEven though trying different values confirms \\(n = 5\\), let's revisit the **Divisibility Rule for \\(11\\)** approach to ensure there are no oversights.\n\n**Recalculations:**\n\n- **Odd Positions Sum:**  \n  \\(8 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 23\\)\n  \n- **Even Positions Sum with \\(n\\):**  \n  \\(5 + n + 2 = 7 + n\\)\n  \n- **Difference:**  \n  \\(23 - (7 + n) = 16 - n\\)\n  \n**Condition for Divisibility by \\(11\\):**\n\n\\[\n16 - n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nn \\equiv 16 \\pmod{11}\n\\]\n\nWhich further simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nn \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis mathematical confirmation aligns with our earlier findings. \\(n = 5\\) is indeed the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nAt the beginning, I considered multiple strategies\u2014applying the divisibility rule, testing different \\(n\\) values, and looking for patterns. Initially, applying the divisibility rule gave me \\(16 - n\\) as the key expression. By testing various \\(n\\) values, I confirmed that only \\(n = 5\\) satisfies the condition.\n\nThroughout the process, checking each step ensured accuracy. Revisiting and cross-checking with the rule solidified that \\(n = 5\\) is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\nn = 5\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Recap:**\n- Started by applying the **Divisibility Rule for \\(11\\)**.\n- Found that \\(16 - n\\) needed to be divisible by \\(11\\).\n- Tested all possible \\(n\\) values from \\(0\\) to \\(9\\).\n- Confirmed \\(n = 5\\) is the only solution.\n- Cross-checked with the rule to ensure correctness.\n\nThis approach, with constant reflection and verification, led to a confident and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$."
