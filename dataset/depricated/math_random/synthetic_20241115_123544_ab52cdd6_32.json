My initial reaction is that dealing with such large exponents directly isn't practical. This reminds me of problems where we need to find the last digit specifically, which often involves patterns or properties of numbers rather than brute force calculations.\n\nI'm thinking: \"Maybe I can use modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 10, since we're only interested in the last digit.\" But then I recall that handling exponents this large directly might still lead to complex calculations.\n\nAnother idea that pops into my head is to look for patterns in the powers of 22. Perhaps the last digits repeat in a cycle, which could simplify things. However, I'm not sure if this approach would work given the multiple layers of exponents.\n\nTo brainstorm further, I consider:\n\n1. **Modular Arithmetic (Base 10):** This seems like a standard approach for finding last digits.\n2. **Properties of Exponents:** Maybe breaking down the exponent using laws of exponents could help.\n3. **Pattern Recognition:** Looking at the last digits of lower powers to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nAt this point, I'm leaning towards using modular arithmetic because it directly addresses the question of finding the last digit. But I'm also open to exploring other methods if this doesn't pan out.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Attempting Modular Arithmetic**\n\nLet's try applying modular arithmetic to see if it leads us in the right direction.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since we're looking for the last digit, we'll work modulo 10.\n- This means we need to evaluate \\(22^{22(11^{11})} \\mod 10\\).\n- But before jumping in, I realize that 22 modulo 10 is 2. So, the problem reduces to finding \\(2^{22(11^{11})} \\mod 10\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because the last digit of 22 is the same as the last digit of 2. So, working with 2 simplifies the problem.\n\n**Calculation:**\nNow, let's explore the pattern in the last digits of powers of 2:\n\n- \\(2^1 = 2\\) \u2192 Last digit: 2\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\) \u2192 Last digit: 4\n- \\(2^3 = 8\\) \u2192 Last digit: 8\n- \\(2^4 = 16\\) \u2192 Last digit: 6\n- \\(2^5 = 32\\) \u2192 Last digit: 2\n- \\(2^6 = 64\\) \u2192 Last digit: 4\n- ...\n\n**Observation:**\nI notice that the last digits repeat every four powers: 2, 4, 8, 6.\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this pattern hold? Let's verify a few more:\n\n- \\(2^7 = 128\\) \u2192 Last digit: 8\n- \\(2^8 = 256\\) \u2192 Last digit: 6\n- \\(2^9 = 512\\) \u2192 Last digit: 2\n- \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) \u2192 Last digit: 4\n\nYes, the pattern repeats: 2, 4, 8, 6.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOkay, so the last digits cycle every four exponents. This is a useful insight because it means that to determine the last digit of \\(2^{22(11^{11})}\\), I just need to find where \\(22(11^{11})\\) falls in this cycle.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Determining the Exponent Modulo 4**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince the last digits of powers of 2 repeat every four exponents, I need to find \\(22(11^{11}) \\mod 4\\). This will tell me which position in the cycle the exponent lands.\n\nBut first, I notice that \\(22 \\mod 4 = 2\\). So, the problem reduces to finding \\(2(11^{11}) \\mod 4\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, can I simplify \\(11^{11} \\mod 4\\) easily? Yes, because 11 is congruent to 3 modulo 4. So, \\(11^{11} \\mod 4\\) is the same as \\(3^{11} \\mod 4\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\nNow, let's compute \\(3^{11} \\mod 4\\):\n\n- \\(3^1 = 3 \\mod 4\\)\n- \\(3^2 = 9 \\mod 4 = 1\\)\n\n**Observation:**\nI see that \\(3^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\). This is significant because it means that higher powers of 3 repeat with a cycle length of 2.\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this pattern hold? Let's verify:\n\n- \\(3^3 = 27 \\mod 4 = 3\\)\n- \\(3^4 = 81 \\mod 4 = 1\\)\n- \\(3^5 = 243 \\mod 4 = 3\\)\n\nYes, the pattern is: 3, 1, 3, 1, ...\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSo, \\(3^{11} \\mod 4\\) is the same as \\(3^1 \\mod 4 = 3\\). Therefore, \\(11^{11} \\mod 4 = 3\\).\n\nNow, returning to the original exponent:\n\n\\[22(11^{11}) \\mod 4 = 2(3) \\mod 4 = 6 \\mod 4 = 2\\]\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Mapping the Exponent to the Last Digit Cycle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I know the exponent \\(22(11^{11}) \\mod 4 = 2\\), I can map this to the last digit cycle of powers of 2: 2, 4, 8, 6.\n\nSince the cycle starts from \\(2^1\\), an exponent of 1 corresponds to the first position in the cycle, an exponent of 2 corresponds to the second position, and so on.\n\n**Reflection:**\nLet me double-check the cycle:\n\n- Exponent 1 \u2192 Last digit: 2\n- Exponent 2 \u2192 Last digit: 4\n- Exponent 3 \u2192 Last digit: 8\n- Exponent 4 \u2192 Last digit: 6\n- (Repeats)\n\nYes, so an exponent of 2 corresponds to the second position in the cycle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the last digit of \\(2^{22(11^{11})}\\) is the same as the last digit of \\(2^2\\), which is **4**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing the answer, I want to ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one and that there are no mistakes in the calculations or reasoning.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Modular Reduction:** Reducing 22 to 2 modulo 10 makes sense because we're only interested in the last digit.\n- **Exponent Modulo 4:** Simplifying \\(11^{11} \\mod 4\\) to \\(3^{11} \\mod 4\\) is correct since 11 is congruent to 3 modulo 4.\n- **Cycle Mapping:** Correctly mapping the exponent modulo 4 to the last digit cycle of 2 powers ensures accurate identification of the last digit.\n\n**Check:**\nDoes the final answer **4** align with the expected outcome? Given the cyclical nature identified and the calculations leading to it, I feel confident that 4 is indeed the correct last digit.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll steps check out. The last digit of \\(22^{22(11^{11})}\\) is **4**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nReflecting on the entire process:\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Exploring different strategies like modular arithmetic and pattern recognition helped in choosing the right path.\n- **Step-by-Step Approach:** Breaking down the problem into manageable parts ensured clarity and correctness.\n- **Continuous Checking:** Regularly verifying each step prevented errors and built confidence in the final answer.\n- **Flexibility:** Being open to changing methods when something didn't seem right contributed to a successful solution.\n\nIn conclusion, by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic and recognizing patterns in the powers of 2, we successfully determined that the last digit of \\(22^{22(11^{11})}\\) is **4**.",

Also, observe that the ones digits of $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \\ldots$ are 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, .... Since $22(11^{11})$ is even but not divisible by 4, it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.
