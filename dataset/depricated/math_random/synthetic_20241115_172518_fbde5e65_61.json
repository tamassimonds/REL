    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, brainstorming and reflecting along the way, just like I would if tackling it on paper. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, **\"What is the 5th term of an arithmetic sequence of 20 terms with first and last terms of 2 and 59, respectively?\"**, a few things come to mind:\n\n- **Arithmetic Sequence:** I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, there's a common difference between consecutive terms. \n- **Finding a Specific Term:** It reminds me of problems where you need to find a specific term given the first and last terms.\n- **Formulas Involved:** Maybe using the formula for the nth term or finding the common difference could be helpful.\n\nBut honestly, I\u2019m not entirely sure how to approach it right away. I recall there are formulas related to arithmetic sequences, but it's been a while since I used them. Let me brainstorm a bit more.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Formula for the nth Term:**  \n   I remember there's a formula for finding the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:  \n   \\[ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \\times d \\]  \n   Where:\n   - \\( a_n \\) is the nth term\n   - \\( a_1 \\) is the first term\n   - \\( d \\) is the common difference\n   - \\( n \\) is the term number\n\n   **Reflection:** This seems straightforward, but I need to find \\( d \\) first. Is there another way to verify?\n\n2. **Find the Common Difference Using the First and Last Terms:**  \n   I could also set up an equation using the first and last terms to find \\( d \\).  \n   Since the sequence has 20 terms, the last term is the first term plus the common difference multiplied by 19.\n\n   **Reflection:** That makes sense. If I can find \\( d \\), I can use it to find any term. But let me think if there\u2019s a quicker way.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average and Check Distribution:**  \n   Another idea is to find the average of the sequence and see how terms are distributed around it.  \n   The average can help in understanding the sequence\u2019s structure.\n\n   **Reflection:** This might give me an intuitive check, but it feels more complex for finding a specific term. Maybe it's better to stick with the formulas.\n\n---\n\n### **Deciding on an Approach**\n\nAfter considering these strategies, I think the most direct way is to:\n\n- First, calculate the common difference \\( d \\) using the first and last terms.\n- Then, use the nth term formula to find the 5th term.\n\n**Wait a minute**: I need to ensure that the sequence has 20 terms with the common difference applying to each step. Let me double-check if this approach aligns with the sequence properties.\n\n**Hmm**, it seems correct because the nth term formula accounts for the position and the common difference. Okay, let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Common Difference \\( d \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI know that the last term \\( a_{20} \\) is related to the first term and the common difference by:\n\n\\[ a_{20} = a_1 + (20 - 1) \\times d \\]  \n\\[ 59 = 2 + 19d \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Subtract 2 from both sides:\n\n  \\[ 59 - 2 = 19d \\]  \n  \\[ 57 = 19d \\]\n\n- Now, divide both sides by 19 to find \\( d \\):\n\n  \\[ d = \\frac{57}{19} \\]  \n  \\[ d = 3 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes \\( d = 3 \\) make sense? Let\u2019s do a quick check:\n\n- If the common difference is 3, adding 3 repeatedly starting from 2 should reach 59 in 20 steps.\n  \n  \\[ 2 + 3 \\times 19 = 2 + 57 = 59 \\]\n  \n- **Looks good!** The calculations align perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Use the nth Term Formula to Find the 5th Term**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have the common difference \\( d = 3 \\), I can use the nth term formula to find the 5th term:\n\n\\[ a_5 = a_1 + (5 - 1) \\times d \\]  \n\\[ a_5 = 2 + 4 \\times 3 \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Multiply the common difference by 4:\n\n  \\[ 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\]\n\n- Add this to the first term:\n\n  \\[ a_5 = 2 + 12 = 14 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, 14 seems too small compared to the last term 59. **Hmm**, let me double-check the steps.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- The common difference is 3.\n- The position is 5, so we need to add the common difference four times to the first term.\n\n  \\[ 2 + 3 \\times 4 = 2 + 12 = 14 \\]\n  \n- **That\u2019s correct!** The sequence increases by 3 each time, so the 5th term is indeed 14.\n\n- **Oh!** I remember now that the sequence starts at 2 and increases by 3, so 14 fits perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verification by Listing the First Few Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nJust to be sure, let's list the first few terms using the common difference and see if the 5th term is 14.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **First term (\\( a_1 \\)):** 2\n- **Second term (\\( a_2 \\)):** \\( 2 + 3 = 5 \\)\n- **Third term (\\( a_3 \\)):** \\( 5 + 3 = 8 \\)\n- **Fourth term (\\( a_4 \\)):** \\( 8 + 3 = 11 \\)\n- **Fifth term (\\( a_5 \\)):** \\( 11 + 3 = 14 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**This matches our calculation!** The 5th term is indeed 14. This verification step reassures me that the approach and calculations are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Does the common difference make sense?** Yes, \\( d = 3 \\) fits perfectly between consecutive terms.\n- **Does the nth term formula apply correctly?** Yes, using \\( a_1 = 2 \\), \\( d = 3 \\), and \\( n = 5 \\) yields \\( a_5 = 14 \\).\n- **Is the sequence consistent?** Yes, listing the terms confirms the calculations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe step-by-step approach, along with verification by listing terms, confirms that the 5th term of the arithmetic sequence is **14**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, calculating the common difference, applying the nth term formula, and verifying through listing, I confidently determined that the 5th term is **14**. Regular reflection and checks ensured the accuracy of each step, making the process robust and reliable.",
