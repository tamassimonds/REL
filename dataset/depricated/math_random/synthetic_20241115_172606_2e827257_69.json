    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'm going to brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Writing it out will help capture the natural thought process, including any doubts or realizations along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, the key details jump out:\n\n- **Infinite Geometric Series:** This immediately makes me think of the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series.\n- **Common Ratio \\( r = -\\frac{1}{5} \\):** The negative ratio suggests the terms will alternate signs, which might affect convergence.\n- **Sum \\( S = 16 \\):** The sum is given, and I need to find the **first term** \\( a \\).\n\nMy initial reaction is to recall the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nGiven that, I think I can plug in the known values to solve for \\( a \\). But before jumping in, let me double-check if this approach makes sense.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Sum Formula Directly:**\n   - Plug in the given sum and common ratio to solve for the first term.\n   \n2. **Verify Convergence:**\n   - Ensure that the series converges by checking the condition \\( |r| < 1 \\).\n\n3. **Alternative Methods:**\n   - Consider expressing the series in terms of its partial sums, though for an infinite series, this might be unnecessary.\n   \n4. **Reflection:**\n   - Given that the sum formula is straightforward, perhaps starting with that is the best path. If it doesn't work out, I can explore other strategies.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Sum Formula**\n\nLet's go ahead and use the sum formula for an infinite geometric series:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n- \\( S = 16 \\)\n- \\( r = -\\frac{1}{5} \\)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n16 = \\frac{a}{1 - (-\\frac{1}{5})}\n\\]\n\n### **Thought Process: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nI need to simplify the denominator first:\n\n\\[\n1 - (-\\frac{1}{5}) = 1 + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{6}{5}\n\\]\n\nSo the equation now is:\n\n\\[\n16 = \\frac{a}{\\frac{6}{5}}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n16 = a \\times \\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for \\( a \\)**\n\nTo isolate \\( a \\), I multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\):\n\n\\[\na = 16 \\times \\frac{6}{5}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\na = 16 \\times \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{96}{5} = 19.2\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection: Checking the Result**\n\nLet me pause and check if this makes sense.\n\n- **Reasonableness Check:** The value \\( 19.2 \\) seems reasonable as a first term, considering the series has a negative common ratio, which would affect subsequent terms.\n- **Re-examination:** Does multiplying \\( 16 \\) by \\( \\frac{6}{5} \\) correctly account for the ratio and sum?\n\nGiven that \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\) is the reciprocal of the denominator we simplified, multiplying by \\( \\frac{6}{5} \\) correctly solves for \\( a \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\nBefore moving on, let's verify that the sum formula was applied correctly.\n\n- **Sum Formula Validity:** For an infinite geometric series, the sum \\( S \\) is only defined if \\( |r| < 1 \\). Here, \\( r = -\\frac{1}{5} \\), so \\( |- \\frac{1}{5}| = \\frac{1}{5} < 1 \\). This confirms that the series converges.\n- **Correctness of Calculations:** \n\n  \\[\n  1 - (-\\frac{1}{5}) = \\frac{6}{5}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  a = 16 \\times \\frac{6}{5} = 19.2\n  \\]\n  \nEverything checks out so far.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Double-Checking with Partial Sums**\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach by thinking about the partial sums of the series.\n\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric series is:\n\n\\[\nS_n = a \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nAs \\( n \\) approaches infinity, and since \\( |r| < 1 \\), \\( r^n \\) approaches \\( 0 \\). Thus:\n\n\\[\nS = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} S_n = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nThis aligns with the sum formula we initially used, confirming that our approach was correct.\n\n### **Final Reflection: Confidence in the Solution**\n\nAfter following through the sum formula, checking the convergence condition, and verifying the calculations, I'm confident that the first term of the series is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{19.2}\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming various strategies and starting with the most direct approach, I was able to solve for the first term \\( a \\) in the infinite geometric series. Throughout the process, I continuously checked and verified each step to ensure the correctness of the solution. This methodical approach helped capture the natural thought process, including initial uncertainties, reflections, and affirmations, leading to a confident and accurate answer.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's dive back into this problem and explore different strategies to identify where I went wrong and how to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Recapping the Problem**\n\nWe have an infinite geometric series with:\n\n- **Common Ratio \\( r = -\\frac{1}{5} \\)**\n- **Sum \\( S = 16 \\)**\n\nWe need to find the **first term \\( a \\)** of the series.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Approach Revisited**\n\nIn my previous attempt, I applied the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\[\n16 = \\frac{a}{1 - (-\\frac{1}{5})} = \\frac{a}{\\frac{6}{5}} = a \\times \\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\nFrom this, I solved for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[\na = 16 \\times \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{96}{5} = 19.2\n\\]\n\nBut now, reflecting on the sample solution provided, I see that the correct answer should be \\( a = \\frac{96}{5} \\), which is \\( 19.2 \\).
