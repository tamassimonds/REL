    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work, and making adjustments as needed\u2014just like I would if I were tackling this problem on my own.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\nOkay, we're dealing with two right triangles. The first one has a side length of 21 inches and a hypotenuse of 29 inches. The second triangle is similar to the first and has a hypotenuse of 87 inches. We need to find the length of the shortest side in the second triangle.\n\nMy first reaction is to use properties of similar triangles. I remember that corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional. But let's explore a few strategies to see which one works best.\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Proportionality of Similar Triangles:**\n   - Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal.\n   - I can set up a proportion between the sides of the two triangles.\n\n2. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   - I could verify the side lengths of the first triangle using the Pythagorean theorem to ensure they make sense.\n   - Then, use similarity to find the corresponding side in the second triangle.\n\n3. **Scaling Factor Calculation:**\n   - Calculate the scaling factor by comparing the hypotenuses of the two triangles.\n   - Use this factor to scale the other sides accordingly.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe proportionality of similar triangles seems straightforward for finding the shortest side. But wait, before jumping in, I should confirm that the given side lengths in the first triangle fit the Pythagorean theorem\u2014just to make sure everything aligns.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the First Triangle with Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure the given side lengths form a right triangle, I'll apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse.\n\n**Calculation:**\nGiven:\n- Hypotenuse (\\( c \\)) = 29 inches\n- One side (\\( a \\)) = 21 inches\n- Let's find the other side (\\( b \\)):\n\n\\[ 21^2 + b^2 = 29^2 \\]  \n\\[ 441 + b^2 = 841 \\]  \n\\[ b^2 = 841 - 441 \\]  \n\\[ b^2 = 400 \\]  \n\\[ b = \\sqrt{400} = 20 \\text{ inches} \\]  \n\n**Reflection:**\nThis makes sense! The side lengths 21 inches and 20 inches satisfy the Pythagorean theorem with a hypotenuse of 29 inches. So, the first triangle is indeed a right triangle.\n\n### **Step 4: Applying the Proportionality of Similar Triangles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I know the first triangle is valid, I can proceed with the similarity property. The scaling factor between the two triangles can be determined by their hypotenuses.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **First Triangle Hypotenuse (\\( c_1 \\))**: 29 inches\n- **Second Triangle Hypotenuse (\\( c_2 \\))**: 87 inches\n\n**Scaling Factor (\\( k \\)):**\n\\[ k = \\frac{c_2}{c_1} = \\frac{87}{29} \\]  \n\\[ k = 3 \\]  \n\n**Reflection:**\nThe scaling factor is 3, meaning each side of the second triangle is 3 times the corresponding side of the first triangle.\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Shortest Side of the Second Triangle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIn the first triangle, the shorter side is 20 inches. To find the corresponding shortest side in the second triangle, I'll multiply the shortest side of the first triangle by the scaling factor.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Shortest side in the second triangle} = 20 \\times 3 = 60 \\text{ inches} \\]  \n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems logical. By scaling up the shortest side of the first triangle by a factor of 3, we get 60 inches for the shortest side of the second triangle.\n\n### **Step 6: Quick Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet me quickly verify if this makes sense. The hypotenuses are scaled from 29 inches to 87 inches, which is indeed a factor of 3. Since the triangles are similar, all corresponding sides should scale similarly. Thus, the shortest side scaling from 20 inches to 60 inches aligns perfectly.\n\n**Check:**\n\\[ \\frac{60}{20} = 3 \\]  \n\\[ \\frac{87}{29} = 3 \\]  \n\nBoth ratios match the scaling factor, confirming the calculation is correct.\n\n### **Step 7: Final Thoughts**\n\n**Reflection:**\nThroughout the process, verifying the first triangle with the Pythagorean theorem ensured that the given side lengths were correct. Then, applying the similarity property and calculating the scaling factor allowed me to find the corresponding side lengths in the second triangle accurately. Checking the ratios confirmed the correctness of the final answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe length of the shortest side of the second triangle is **60 inches**.\n\n---\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, verifying initial conditions, and systematically applying proportionality rules while continuously checking the work, I ensured a thorough and accurate solution to the problem.",

Since 87 is 3 times 29, the length of the shortest side of the second triangle must be $3 \\times 20 = \\boxed{60\\text{ inches}}$."
