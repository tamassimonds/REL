    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming how to approach it, exploring different strategies, and adjusting my methods as needed. I'll make sure to reflect frequently, check my work, and be open to changing directions if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\nOkay, the problem states that \\(\\cos x = 0\\) and \\(\\cos(x + z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\). We're asked to find the smallest possible positive value of \\(z\\) in radians. \n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, \\(\\cos x = 0\\) reminds me of the standard angles where the cosine function equals zero. And then, \\(\\cos(x + z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\) is a familiar cosine value too. This feels like a trigonometric identities or angles addition problem.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Use Trigonometric Identities:** Perhaps applying the cosine addition formula could help.\n2. **Think About Unit Circle Values:** Recall where the cosine function takes specific values like 0 and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n3. **Set Up Equations Using Known Angles:** Use known angles to set up equations and solve for \\(z\\).\n\n**Uncertainty:**\nI'm not entirely sure which strategy will be the most straightforward. Maybe starting with known angles will give a clearer path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying \\(\\cos x = 0\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI know that \\(\\cos x = 0\\) at \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi\\), where \\(k\\) is any integer. This is because the cosine function equals zero at odd multiples of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nx = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi \\quad (k \\in \\mathbb{Z})\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis gives me all possible values of \\(x\\) where the cosine is zero. I'll need this to explore the second equation, \\(\\cos(x + z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because the cosine function is zero at these angles. I think I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing \\(\\cos(x + z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need \\(\\cos(x + z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\). From the unit circle, I remember that \\(\\cos\\) equals \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) at angles \\(2n\\pi/3\\) and \\(4n\\pi/3\\), where \\(n\\) is any integer.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nx + z = 2n\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x + z = 4n\\frac{\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, combining this with the previous step could get messy, especially with the \\(n\\) terms overlapping. Maybe there's a more straightforward way using the cosine addition formula.\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this approach work? It seems like it might complicate things. Perhaps applying an identity could streamline the process.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering the Cosine Addition Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's try using the cosine addition formula: \n\\[\n\\cos(a + b) = \\cos a \\cos b - \\sin a \\sin b\n\\]\nIn our case, \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = z\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\nGiven \\(\\cos x = 0\\),\n\\[\n\\cos(x + z) = \\cos x \\cos z - \\sin x \\sin z = 0 \\cdot \\cos z - \\sin x \\sin z = -\\sin x \\sin z\n\\]\nBut we know \\(\\cos(x + z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\), so:\n\\[\n-\\sin x \\sin z = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\sin x\\) can be determined from \\(\\cos x = 0\\), we have \\(\\sin x = \\pm 1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems promising because it reduces the equation to just \\(\\sin z\\) using known values of \\(\\sin x\\). Let's proceed.\n\n**Check:**\nIs this correct? Yes, since \\(\\cos x = 0\\) implies \\(\\sin x = \\pm 1\\), the equation simplifies nicely.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving for \\(\\sin z\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, substituting \\(\\sin x = \\pm 1\\) into the equation:\n\\[\n-\\sin x \\sin z = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nThis becomes:\n\\[\n-\\pm 1 \\cdot \\sin z = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nSo, \\(\\sin z = \\mp \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\sin z = -\\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\sin z = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, these are common sine values. I know \\(\\sin z = \\frac{1}{2}\\) at \\(z = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi\\) and \\(\\sin z = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) at \\(z = \\frac{7\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi\\), where \\(k\\) is any integer.\n\n**Check:**\nAre these correct? Yes, because these are the angles where the sine function equals \\(\\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Smallest Positive \\(z\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWe need the smallest positive value of \\(z\\). From the solutions:\n1. \\(\\sin z = \\frac{1}{2}\\) gives \\(z = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) (since \\(2k\\pi\\) gives multiple cycles, \\(k=0\\) is the smallest positive).\n2. \\(\\sin z = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) gives \\(z = \\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\) (similarly, \\(k=0\\) here).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nz = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad z = \\frac{7\\pi}{6}\n\\]\nAmong these, the smallest positive \\(z\\) is:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems correct because \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\approx 0.52\\) radians, and \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{6} \\approx 3.67\\) radians. The smaller positive angle is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\n\n**Check:**\nIs \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) a valid solution? Let's verify:\n- If \\(z = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), then \\(\\sin z = \\frac{1}{2}\\), which satisfies \\(-\\sin x \\sin z = \\frac{1}{2}\\) because \\(\\sin x = \\pm 1\\).\n- Thus, \\(z = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) is indeed correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe smallest possible positive value of \\(z\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{6}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nLooking back, this approach made sense because starting with known values of \\(\\cos x\\) allowed us to simplify the equation using trigonometric identities. Initially, considering the unit circle helped identify possible angles, but applying the cosine addition formula streamlined the process. \n\n**Check:**\n- Does \\(\\cos x = 0\\) lead to \\(\\sin x = \\pm 1\\)? Yes.\n- Does \\(-\\sin x \\sin z = \\frac{1}{2}\\) simplify correctly? Yes.\n- Is \\(\\sin z = \\frac{1}{2}\\) at \\(z = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\)? Yes.\n- Is \\(z = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) the smallest positive value? Yes.\n\nEverything checks out, and the reasoning holds throughout. This step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, exploring different strategies, and reflecting at each stage, led to the correct and verified solution.",
