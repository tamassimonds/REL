I remember that sine and cosine graphs can be transformed with amplitude changes, frequency adjustments, vertical shifts, and horizontal (phase) shifts. \n\n- **Phase shift** usually relates to how the graph is shifted left or right.\n- **General form:** I know the sine function can be expressed as \\( y = a \\sin(bx + c) + d \\), where \\( b \\) affects the period, \\( c \\) relates to the phase shift, and \\( d \\) is a vertical shift.\n\nBut looking at the given function \\( y = \\sin(3x - \\pi) \\), it seems to fit that general form. Let me brainstorm how to extract the phase shift from this.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Comparison Approach:** Compare the given function to the general form to identify the components.\n- **Formula Approach:** Use the standard formula for phase shift.\n- **Graphical Understanding:** Visualize how changing \\( c \\) in \\( bx + c \\) affects the graph.\n\nI think starting with the **Comparison Approach** makes sense because it's straightforward. If that doesn't seem clear, I can explore the other methods.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Applying the Comparison Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's write the given function in the general form to identify the phase shift.\n\n- Given: \\( y = \\sin(3x - \\pi) \\)\n- General form: \\( y = a \\sin(bx + c) + d \\)\n\n**Identifying Components:**\n\n- **Coefficient of \\( x \\):** Here, \\( b = 3 \\).\n- **Constant Term:** \\( bx + c \\) is \\( 3x - \\pi \\), so \\( c = -\\pi \\).\n- **Amplitude (\\( a \\)):** Implicitly \\( 1 \\) since there's no coefficient before sine.\n- **Vertical Shift (\\( d \\)):** Implicitly \\( 0 \\) since there's no added constant outside sine.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nWait, does this make sense? If \\( c = -\\pi \\), it seems like the phase shift is to the left by \\( \\pi \\). But so far, this doesn't feel entirely clear. Maybe I need to double-check if this aligns with the standard phase shift formula.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Verifying with the Phase Shift Formula**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nThe standard formula for phase shift is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Phase Shift} = -\\frac{c}{b}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is from \\( bx + c \\) and \\( b \\) is the coefficient of \\( x \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Given:** \\( b = 3 \\), \\( c = -\\pi \\)\n- **Plugging in values:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Phase Shift} = -\\frac{-\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nHmm, I initially thought the phase shift was \\( -\\pi \\) based on the \\( c \\) value, but using the phase shift formula gives \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\). Let me reflect on this.\n\n- **Wait a minute:** The negative sign in the formula cancels out the negative \\( c \\), resulting in a positive \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, a positive phase shift means the graph is shifted to the right, which aligns with the formula.\n\nThis feels more accurate. The formula approach clarified that the phase shift is indeed \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\) to the right.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Alternative Method - Visualization Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo solidify my understanding, let me think about how the phase shift affects the sine graph visually.\n\n- **Sine Function Basics:** The sine function has a period of \\( 2\\pi \\). Modifying \\( b \\) changes the period to \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{b} \\).\n- **Phase Shift Effect:** Adding \\( c \\) inside \\( bx + c \\) shifts the graph horizontally.\n- **Given Function:** \\( y = \\sin(3x - \\pi) \\)\n\n**Reflecting:**\n\n- **With \\( b = 3 \\):** The period is \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\).\n- **Phase Shift \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\):** This tells us the graph shifts to the right by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\n**Checking:**\n\nDoes this match our earlier calculation? Yes, it confirms that the phase shift is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Final Verification**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet's see if everything aligns:\n\n1. **Comparison Approach:** Initially suggested \\( -\\pi \\) left shift, but realizing the need for the formula clarified it.\n2. **Phase Shift Formula:** Calculated \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\) right shift, which matches the expected outcome.\n3. **Visualization Approach:** Confirms the graph shifts right by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\n**My Thoughts:**\n\nThis feels consistent now. The phase shift is indeed \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\) to the **right**. The initial confusion with \\( -\\pi \\) was resolved by applying the correct formula, ensuring that the direction and magnitude of the shift are accurate.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and reflecting on each step:\n\n- **Correct Phase Shift:** The graph of \\( y = \\sin(3x - \\pi) \\) is shifted **to the right by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\)**.\n- **Strategies Used:**\n  - **Comparison Approach:** Identified components of the function.\n  - **Phase Shift Formula:** Provided the correct calculation.\n  - **Visualization Approach:** Reinforced the understanding through graphical interpretation.\n- **Reflection:** Initially misidentified the phase shift, but double-checking with the formula and visualizing helped correct the path.\n\nThis step-by-step approach ensured a thorough and accurate determination of the phase shift, aligning both algebraic and graphical perspectives.",
