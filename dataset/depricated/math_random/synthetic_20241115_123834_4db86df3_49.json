    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, just like how I would naturally approach it if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts & Brainstorming**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I'm thinking: \"This looks like a specialized operation between two numbers, similar to how we define addition or multiplication.\" The operator \\(a \\text{ Y } b\\) is defined as \\(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation:** Plug in the numbers \\(3\\) and \\(2\\) directly into the definition and compute.\n   \n2. **Simplification:** Try to simplify the expression to see if it resembles something familiar, like a perfect square.\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Use algebraic identities to rewrite the expression in a more manageable form.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAt first glance, the expression \\(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\) reminds me of the expansion of a binomial square. This gives me a hint that maybe there's a simpler way to look at it, but I'm not completely sure yet.\n\nI think the **Direct Calculation** method might be straightforward, but it could be beneficial to explore the **Simplification** strategy to see if it leads to an easier path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Direct Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start by simply plugging in \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 2\\) into the given definition of \\(a \\text{ Y } b\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ Y } 2 = 3^2 - 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 + 2^2\n\\]\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n\\[\n3^2 = 9\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 12\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting back:\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ Y } 2 = 9 - 12 + 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9 - 12 = -3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-3 + 4 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nSo, \\(3 \\text{ Y } 2 = 1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I'm wondering if there's a pattern or a quicker method I might be missing, especially since the expression looks like a perfect square. Let's see if simplifying the expression can provide another perspective.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Simplification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe expression \\(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\) looks familiar. In fact, it resembles the expansion of \\((a - b)^2\\), which is \\(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\). This realization makes me think that maybe the operation \\(a \\text{ Y } b\\) is just \\((a - b)^2\\).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nIf \\(a \\text{ Y } b\\) is indeed \\((a - b)^2\\), then simplifying the expression could confirm this and perhaps make the calculation easier.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\na \\text{ Y } b = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\nRecognizing that:\n\n\\[\na^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ Y } 2 = (3 - 2)^2 = 1^2 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, this matches our previous calculation using the direct method. So, whether we compute it directly or recognize it as a perfect square, the answer is consistently \\(1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis simplification confirms that \\(3 \\text{ Y } 2 = 1\\). It also hints that understanding the underlying identity can make solving similar problems quicker in the future.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Simplification Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt's important to ensure that the simplification is correct. If \\(a \\text{ Y } b\\) is indeed defined as \\((a - b)^2\\), then our earlier steps should hold true.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLooking back at the definition:\n\n\\[ \na \\text{ Y } b = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \n\\]\n\nAnd recalling that:\n\n\\[\n(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\nIt aligns perfectly. This confirms that the simplification was correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBy recognizing the expression as a perfect square, we not only verified our initial calculation but also gained deeper insight into the operation's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlthough both methods reached the same solution, I want to explore if there are other strategies or perhaps a quicker mental math approach to ensure no steps were missed and to solidify understanding.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\nAnother way to think about it could be to rearrange the expression and see if it simplifies further, or maybe to examine if there's a pattern when different values are used.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's look at another example to see if the pattern holds:\n\nSuppose \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ Y } 1 = 4^2 - 2 \\times 4 \\times 1 + 1^2 = 16 - 8 + 1 = 9\n\\]\n\nAnd according to our simplification:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ Y } 1 = (4 - 1)^2 = 3^2 = 9\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, \\(9\\). This consistency reinforces the correctness of our approach.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nExploring another example confirms that the simplification holds true for different values, ensuring that our initial solution wasn't just a coincidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n**Summary:**\n\nInitially, I approached the problem by directly calculating the expression \\(3 \\text{ Y } 2\\) using its definition, which gave me an answer of \\(1\\). However, recognizing that the expression is a perfect square \\((a - b)^2\\) allowed me to simplify the problem, confirming that \\(3 \\text{ Y } 2\\) also equals \\(1\\) through a different lens.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ Y } 2 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection and Verification:**\n\nBy checking and confirming the solution through multiple strategies, I've ensured that the answer is accurate. This step-by-step exploration not only provided the correct solution but also deepened my understanding of the operation's definition, making it easier to tackle similar problems in the future.\n\n**Takeaway:**\n\nAlways consider different approaches to a problem. Sometimes, simplifying the expression can reveal patterns that make calculations quicker and more intuitive. Checking and verifying each step helps catch any potential mistakes early, ensuring a reliable solution.",
