    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and approach it just as I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work along the way to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question is asking for the **range** of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Hmm, this looks similar to functions I've dealt with before, especially reciprocal functions. I remember that they often have interesting ranges because they involve squaring and reciprocating. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start right away.\n  \n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  - **Graphical Approach:** Maybe plotting the function would help visualize its behavior.\n  - **Algebraic Analysis:** I could try to analyze the function algebraically to see what values \\( f(x) \\) can take.\n  - **Calculus Involvement:** Considering limits or derivatives might provide insight into its extrema.\n  - **Symmetry Consideration:** Noticing that \\( x^2 \\) makes the function even could simplify things.\n\n- **Exploring Options:** At first glance, a graphical approach seems appealing to get a visual understanding. But I also think an algebraic method would provide a concrete answer. Calculus might help verify our findings. Let's try starting with the graphical approach to get a feel for it, then move on to algebra.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Graphical Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s visualize the function to understand its behavior. I\u2019ll consider how \\( f(x) \\) changes as \\( x \\) varies.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, maybe I should outline what I expect from the graph. Since \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\), I remember that as \\( x \\) gets larger, \\( f(x) \\) gets smaller. And as \\( x \\) approaches zero, \\( f(x) \\) should increase significantly.\n\n**Action:**  \nImagine plotting the graph:  \n- For \\( x = 1 \\), \\( f(1) = \\frac{1}{1^2} = 1 \\).\n- For \\( x = 2 \\), \\( f(2) = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \\).\n- As \\( x \\) approaches 0 from either side, \\( f(x) \\) increases towards infinity.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, the graph should be a curve that never touches the x-axis (since \\( f(x) > 0 \\) for all \\( x \\neq 0 \\)).\n\n**Conclusion of Step:**  \nThe graph suggests that \\( f(x) \\) takes on positive values, increasing without bound as \\( x \\) approaches 0, and decreasing towards 0 as \\( |x| \\) increases. \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Algebraic Approach to Confirm**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's try to confirm this observation algebraically. I should analyze the function to determine all possible output values.\n\n**Action:**  \nConsider the equation \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\).\n\n- Since \\( x^2 \\) is always positive for \\( x \\neq 0 \\), \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) must also be positive.\n- Therefore, \\( f(x) > 0 \\) for all \\( x \\neq 0 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, so the function never touches zero or becomes negative. That aligns with what I saw in the graph.\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, but what about very large or very small \\( x \\)? Does \\( f(x) \\) approach any particular value?\n\n- As \\( |x| \\) increases, \\( x^2 \\) increases, making \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) decrease towards zero.\n- But it never actually reaches zero; it only approaches it.\n\n**Conclusion of Step:**  \nAlgebraically, we confirm that the range of \\( f(x) \\) is all positive numbers but never includes zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculus Approach for Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo further verify, let's consider the limits and possibly the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) to see its behavior more rigorously.\n\n**Action:**  \n- **Limit as \\( x \\) approaches 0:**  \n  \\[\n  \\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\infty\n  \\]\n  \n- **Limit as \\( |x| \\) approaches infinity:**  \n  \\[\n  \\lim_{|x| \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\lim_{|x| \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2} = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Derivative to Check Monotonicity:**  \n  \\[\n  f'(x) = -\\frac{2}{x^3}\n  \\]\n  \n  This tells us that \\( f'(x) < 0 \\) for all \\( x \\neq 0 \\), meaning \\( f(x) \\) is always decreasing.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOh, so \\( f(x) \\) is a decreasing function, which makes sense because as \\( x \\) increases or decreases from zero, \\( f(x) \\) decreases. And the limits confirm that the range extends from zero to infinity, but zero is never actually attained.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this align with our previous findings? Yes, the calculus approach reinforces that the range is all positive values, never including zero.\n\n**Conclusion of Step:**  \nBy applying calculus, we verify that the range of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s reflect on all the approaches to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Action:**  \n- **Graphical Insight:** Showed that \\( f(x) \\) decreases from infinity to zero as \\( |x| \\) increases.\n- **Algebraic Analysis:** Confirmed that \\( f(x) > 0 \\) for all \\( x \\neq 0 \\).\n- **Calculus Verification:** Provided limits and derivative insights, solidifying that \\( f(x) \\) approaches zero but never reaches it.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything aligns perfectly. Initially, I thought about starting with a graph, which helped me visualize the function. Then, confirming it algebraically ensured accuracy. Lastly, calculus provided a rigorous check, especially regarding the behavior at extremes.\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, is there any possibility that \\( f(x) \\) could take negative values or zero? No, because \\( x^2 > 0 \\) for all \\( x \\neq 0 \\), so \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) can never be zero or negative.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is all positive real numbers:  \n\\[\n\\text{Range} = (0, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorm Recap:** Starting with a graphical approach gave me an intuitive understanding, which I confirmed through algebra and then rigorously verified using calculus.\n- **Mistakes and Corrections:** Initially, I wasn't sure where to begin, but exploring different strategies helped me find a coherent path. There were no major dead ends, but reflecting often guided me to the correct conclusion.\n- **Aha Moments:** Realizing that \\( f(x) \\) is always decreasing and that it never reaches zero were key insights that solidified the range.\n\nOverall, taking it step-by-step, checking each method, and ensuring everything aligns led me to confidently determine the range of the function.",

  "ground_truth": "Note that $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} >0$ for all nonzero $x$. That is, the range of $f$ must only include positive numbers. Conversely, if $a$ is a positive number, then \\[f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{(1/\\sqrt{a})^2} = a,\\]so $a$ is indeed in the range of $f$. Thus, the range of $f$ is the set of all positive real numbers; in interval notation, that's $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$."
