    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore each one, and reflect often to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the expression \\( \\frac{x^2 - x - 6}{x - 3} \\) with \\( x = 2 \\), I think:\n\n- **Substitution:** Maybe I can just plug \\( x = 2 \\) directly into the expression.\n- **Simplification:** Perhaps simplifying the expression first might make substitution easier.\n- **Factorization:** Could factoring the numerator help at all?\n\nBut then, I'm reminded that plugging in \\( x = 2 \\) directly could be straightforward, yet I'm not entirely confident if that would be the best approach. Maybe simplifying first will give me a clearer view.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Substitution:** Plug \\( x = 2 \\) into the expression as it is.\n2. **Simplify Before Substituting:** Simplify the expression to see if there's a cancellation that makes substituting easier.\n3. **Factor the Numerator:** See if factoring helps in simplifying the expression.\n4. **Evaluate Numerator and Denominator Separately:** Compute both parts separately before dividing.\n\nI think starting with **Direct Substitution** seems the most straightforward, but to be thorough, I'll also consider simplifying the expression first to see if anything cancels out.\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Direct Substitution**\n\nI'll try plugging \\( x = 2 \\) directly into the expression.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(2)^2 - (2) - 6}{2 - 3}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4 - 2 - 6}{2 - 3} = \\frac{-4}{-1} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check if the direct substitution method is correct, or if I overlooked something.\n\n### **Check: Is Direct Substitution Correct?**\n\n- **Numerator:** \\( 4 - 2 - 6 = -4 \\)\n- **Denominator:** \\( 2 - 3 = -1 \\)\n- **Division:** \\( \\frac{-4}{-1} = 4 \\)\n\nQuick check: The calculations make sense. However, just to be sure, I'll explore another strategy to see if the result remains consistent.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Simplification**\n\nMaybe simplifying the expression before substituting will confirm the result.\n\n**Simplifying the Expression:**\n\nLet's try to factor the numerator to see if anything cancels with the denominator.\n\n\\[\nx^2 - x - 6\n\\]\n\nI remember that \\( -6 \\) can be factored as \\( 2 \\times -3 \\). Let's see if that works:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - x - 6 = (x - 3)(x + 2)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, factoring the numerator gives me \\( (x - 3)(x + 2) \\). This suggests that the expression can be simplified significantly.\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Original Expression**\n\nIf I substitute the factored form back into the original expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x - 3)(x + 2)}{x - 3}\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\( x \\neq 3 \\) (to avoid division by zero), I can cancel \\( x - 3 \\) from the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[\nx + 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis simplification indicates that the original expression simplifies to \\( x + 2 \\) as long as \\( x \\neq 3 \\). Now, substituting \\( x = 2 \\) into this simplified expression should confirm the result.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Simplified Expression**\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 2 \\) into the simplified expression:\n\n\\[\n2 + 2 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nBoth methods\u2014direct substitution and simplifying first\u2014yield the same result: \\( 4 \\). This consistency gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nInitially, I considered direct substitution, which led me to the correct answer. However, by exploring the simplification strategy, I confirmed that the expression simplifies to \\( x + 2 \\), making the substitution straightforward and validating the result.\n\nReflecting throughout the process helped ensure that each step was correct and aligned with different approaches. It's always good to check and cross-verify, especially when multiple strategies lead to the same conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe value of the expression \\( \\frac{x^2 - x - 6}{x - 3} \\) for \\( x = 2 \\) is **4**.",
