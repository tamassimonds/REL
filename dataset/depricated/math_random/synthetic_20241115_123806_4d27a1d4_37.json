    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step-by-step, just like I would approach it if I were solving it on paper. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming and exploring different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let\u2019s see where this takes us!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem:\n\n**User Query:** What is the sum of the value(s) of \\( n \\) for which \\( |2n - 7| = 3 \\)?\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This involves an absolute value equation. I remember that absolute values represent distances, so \\( |2n - 7| = 3 \\) means that \\( 2n - 7 \\) is 3 units away from 0. \n- **Similar Problems:** This reminds me of solving equations like \\( |x| = a \\), where I\u2019d set up two separate equations to account for positive and negative scenarios.\n- **Brainstorming:** Maybe I can set up two equations: \\( 2n - 7 = 3 \\) and \\( 2n - 7 = -3 \\). That seems like a standard approach.\n\nBut wait, let me think... Is there another way to approach absolute values, or is setting up two equations the best method here?\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Strategy 1:** **Set Up Two Separate Equations**\n   - **Thought Process:** Since the absolute value can be positive or negative, I can create two equations:\n     - \\( 2n - 7 = 3 \\)\n     - \\( 2n - 7 = -3 \\)\n\n2. **Strategy 2:** **Graphical Approach**\n   - **Thought Process:** Graph the lines \\( y = 2n - 7 \\) and \\( y = 3 \\) and \\( y = -3 \\). The points of intersection would give me the solutions.\n   - **Reflection:** This might be more visual and take longer. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s necessary for a simple equation like this.\n\n3. **Strategy 3:** **Use Properties of Absolute Values**\n   - **Thought Process:** Recall that \\( |x| = a \\) implies \\( x = a \\) or \\( x = -a \\). Apply this directly to the equation.\n   - **Reflection:** This seems straightforward and aligns with Strategy 1.\n\n**Decision:** Given the simplicity of the problem, Strategy 1\u2014setting up two separate equations\u2014feels like the most efficient approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equations**\n\nFollowing Strategy 1:\n\n- **Equation 1:** \\( 2n - 7 = 3 \\)\n- **Equation 2:** \\( 2n - 7 = -3 \\)\n\n**Thought Process:** By solving these two equations, I'll find the values of \\( n \\) that satisfy the absolute value condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving Equation 1**\n\n**Equation:** \\( 2n - 7 = 3 \\)\n\n- **Thought Process:** Add 7 to both sides to isolate \\( 2n \\).\n  \\[\n  2n - 7 + 7 = 3 + 7 \\\\\n  2n = 10\n  \\]\n- **Next Step:** Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( n \\).\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n  \\]\n- **Reflection:** So, \\( n = 5 \\) is one solution. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\n  **Quick Check:** \n  \\[\n  |2(5) - 7| = |10 - 7| = |3| = 3\n  \\]\n   - **Verdict:** Yes, it satisfies the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving Equation 2**\n\n**Equation:** \\( 2n - 7 = -3 \\)\n\n- **Thought Process:** Add 7 to both sides to isolate \\( 2n \\).\n  \\[\n  2n - 7 + 7 = -3 + 7 \\\\\n  2n = 4\n  \\]\n- **Next Step:** Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( n \\).\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n  \\]\n- **Reflection:** So, \\( n = 2 \\) is the other solution. Let me verify it.\n\n  **Quick Check:** \n  \\[\n  |2(2) - 7| = |4 - 7| = |-3| = 3\n  \\]\n   - **Verdict:** Yes, it also satisfies the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Summing the Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:** The question asks for the sum of the values of \\( n \\) that satisfy the equation. We\u2019ve found \\( n = 5 \\) and \\( n = 2 \\), so I\u2019ll add them together.\n\n\\[\n5 + 2 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Summing the two solutions makes sense. Let me do a quick check to ensure everything aligns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Quick Check of the Approach**\n\n**Check:** \n\n- **Did I set up the equations correctly?** Yes, \\( 2n - 7 = 3 \\) and \\( 2n - 7 = -3 \\) are accurate based on the absolute value definition.\n- **Are the solutions verified?** Yes, both \\( n = 5 \\) and \\( n = 2 \\) satisfy the original equation.\n- **Is the sum correct?** Adding 5 and 2 gives 7, which seems reasonable.\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. The approach was straightforward, and the solutions are verified.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Graphical Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:** To ensure the correctness, let\u2019s briefly consider a graphical approach.\n\n1. **Graph the Function:** Plot \\( y = |2n - 7| \\).\n2. **Find Intersections:** Determine where this graph intersects \\( y = 3 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Intersection Points:** According to the graphical method, the points where \\( |2n - 7| = 3 \\) are \\( n = 5 \\) and \\( n = 2 \\).\n- **Consistency with Previous Method:** This confirms the solutions obtained earlier.\n\n**Decision:** The graphical approach aligns with our algebraic method, reinforcing the correctness of our solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Mistakes or Dead Ends:** Initially considered a graphical approach, which, while correct, wasn\u2019t necessary given the simplicity of the problem. It added extra steps.\n- **Realizations:** The algebraic method was straightforward and efficient for this type of equation.\n- **Approaches Used:** Started with setting up two equations, verified solutions individually, and double-checked the sum. The alternative graphical approach confirmed the algebraic solution.\n- **Conclusion:** The sum of the values of \\( n \\) that satisfy \\( |2n - 7| = 3 \\) is **7**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{7}\\)\n\n---\n\nLet me know if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019d like to explore or if another problem needs tackling!",
