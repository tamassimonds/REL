I'll write it out as I would if I were solving it myself, complete with initial confusion, dead-ends, \"aha\" moments, and everything in between.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see it's about polynomial factors. Specifically, if \\(2x + 7\\) is a factor of \\(6x^3 + 19x^2 + cx + 35\\), I need to find the value of \\(c\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  - **Polynomial Long Division:** This seems like a straightforward way to see if \\(2x + 7\\) divides the polynomial evenly.\n  - **Synthetic Division:** Maybe using synthetic division could simplify the process, especially since the divisor is linear.\n  - **Factor Theorem:** I recall that if \\(2x + 7\\) is a factor, then substituting its root into the polynomial should yield zero.\n  \n  Thinking about these options, the **Factor Theorem** stands out because it directly relates the factor to the root of the polynomial. However, using **Polynomial or Synthetic Division** might provide a more structured approach.\n\n- **Checking Feasibility:**\n  - **Applying Factor Theorem:** If I use the Factor Theorem, I can quickly find \\(c\\) by setting up an equation based on the root of \\(2x + 7\\).\n  - **Long Division vs. Synthetic Division:** Polynomial long division might be cumbersome, but synthetic division could be quicker if I set it up correctly.\n\n**Decision:** Let's start with the **Factor Theorem**, as it seems the most direct method. If that feels off or too complex, I'll pivot to synthetic division.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Factor Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The **Factor Theorem** states that if \\(2x + 7\\) is a factor, then the polynomial \\(6x^3 + 19x^2 + cx + 35\\) must equal zero when \\(x\\) is replaced by the root of \\(2x + 7\\).\n- To find the root of \\(2x + 7 = 0\\), let's solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n2x + 7 = 0 \\\\\n2x = -7 \\\\\nx = -\\frac{7}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting on This Step:**\n- So, I need to substitute \\(x = -\\frac{7}{2}\\) into the polynomial \\(6x^3 + 19x^2 + cx + 35\\) and set the equation equal to zero to solve for \\(c\\).\n\n**Possible Concern:**\n- Is substituting such a fraction directly into the cubic polynomial manageable? It might get a bit messy, but let's proceed and see.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting \\(x = -\\frac{7}{2}\\) into the Polynomial**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Time to substitute \\(x = -\\frac{7}{2}\\) into each term of the polynomial and simplify.\n- This will give us an equation in terms of \\(c\\) which we can solve.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n6\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^3 + 19\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 + c\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right) + 35 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Breaking It Down:**\n1. **Calculate \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^3 = -\\frac{343}{8}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{4}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Multiply by Coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times -\\frac{343}{8} = -\\frac{2058}{8} = -\\frac{1029}{4} \\quad \\text{(simplified)}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   19 \\times \\frac{49}{4} = \\frac{931}{4}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Substitute Back into the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{1029}{4} + \\frac{931}{4} - \\frac{7}{2}c + 35 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Simplify Constant Terms:**\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{1029}{4} + \\frac{931}{4} + 35 = -\\frac{1029 - 931}{4} + 35 = -\\frac{98}{4} + 35 = -24.5 + 35 = 10.5\n   \\]\n   \n   So,\n   \\[\n   10.5 - \\frac{7}{2}c = 0\n   \\]\n   \n**Check:**\n- Everything seems to be calculated correctly so far. The constants have been simplified, and now we have a linear equation in terms of \\(c\\).\n\n**Feeling About This Approach:**\n- This method is straightforward and directly follows the Factor Theorem. The calculations, albeit a bit messy, lead to a solvable equation for \\(c\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\(c\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, I need to isolate \\(c\\) in the equation \\(10.5 - \\frac{7}{2}c = 0\\).\n- Let's move the constant term to the other side and solve for \\(c\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n10.5 = \\frac{7}{2}c \\\\\nc = \\frac{10.5 \\times 2}{7} \\\\\nc = \\frac{21}{7} \\\\\nc = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Multiplying \\(10.5\\) by \\(2\\) gives \\(21\\). Dividing \\(21\\) by \\(7\\) simplifies to \\(3\\).\n- This seems correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The value of \\(c\\) is determined to be \\(3\\). The approach worked as expected, confirming that \\(2x + 7\\) is indeed a factor of the polynomial with \\(c = 3\\).\n\n**Double-Check:**\n- Before finalizing, let's quickly verify if substituting \\(c = 3\\) back into the original polynomial makes \\(2x + 7\\) a factor.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To ensure correctness, substitute \\(c = 3\\) back into the polynomial and check if \\(2x + 7\\) truly divides it without a remainder.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n6x^3 + 19x^2 + 3x + 35\n\\]\n- Divide this by \\(2x + 7\\):\n  \nUsing **Synthetic Division** for efficiency:\n1. **Set Up Synthetic Division:**\n   - Divisor: \\(2x + 7\\) \u21d2 Root: \\(x = -\\frac{7}{2}\\)\n   - Coefficients: \\(6, 19, 3, 35\\)\n\n2. **Perform Synthetic Division:**\n   - Bring down the leading coefficient \\(6\\).\n   - Multiply \\(6\\) by \\(-\\frac{7}{2}\\) \u21d2 \\(-21\\).\n   - Add to the next coefficient: \\(19 + (-21) = -2\\).\n   - Multiply \\(-2\\) by \\(-\\frac{7}{2}\\) \u21d2 \\(7\\).\n   - Add to the next coefficient: \\(3 + 7 = 10\\).\n   - Multiply \\(10\\) by \\(-\\frac{7}{2}\\) \u21d2 \\(-35\\).\n   - Add to the constant: \\(35 + (-35) = 0\\).\n\n3. **Result of Synthetic Division:**\n   \\[\n   6x^2 - 2x + 10 \\quad \\text{(Quotient)}\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder:** \\(0\\)\n\n**Check:**\n- The remainder is \\(0\\), confirming that \\(2x + 7\\) is indeed a factor when \\(c = 3\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This verification step reassures that the initial approach was correct. Substituting \\(c = 3\\) satisfies the condition set by the Factor Theorem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:** Starting with the Factor Theorem was effective as it directly linked the factor to the root of the polynomial.\n- **Exploration:** Considering synthetic division added an extra layer of verification, making sure the factorization works without any remainder.\n- **Checking Work:** Throughout, I checked calculations and reflected on the process, ensuring each step logically connected to the next.\n- **Outcome:** The value of \\(c\\) is confidently determined to be \\(3\\), with multiple checks confirming its correctness.\n\nIn summary, by paralleling a human's problem-solving approach\u2014brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, checking calculations, and verifying outcomes\u2014I arrived at the solution methodically and ensured its validity at each step.",
