    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem just like how I would approach it in real life\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies along the way. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d think through it step by step:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, the problem asks for the product of the **least common multiple (LCM)** and the **greatest common factor (GCF)** of **20** and **90**. \n\n- **Immediate Reaction:** \n  - This reminds me of concepts we often see in number theory and algebra.\n  - I recall that LCM and GCF are related by a specific formula involving multiplication, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the best way to start.\n  - Maybe I should explore different strategies to see which one makes the most sense\u2014or see if one leads me astray.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Relationship Formula:**\n   - I remember that **LCM \u00d7 GCF = Product of the Two Numbers**.\n   - So, I could directly multiply 20 and 90 to find the product and then divide by one of LCM or GCF if needed.\n\n2. **Calculate LCM and GCF Separately:**\n   - Find LCM of 20 and 90.\n   - Find GCF of 20 and 90.\n   - Multiply them together to verify the relationship.\n\n3. **Prime Factorization Approach:**\n   - Factor both numbers into their prime components.\n   - Use these factorizations to find LCM and GCF.\n\n4. **Utilize Listing Multiples and Factors:**\n   - List multiples of 20 and 90 to find the LCM.\n   - List factors of 20 and 90 to find the GCF.\n\n**Reflection:** \n- The relationship formula seems the quickest, but I want to ensure that I understand why it works. It might be helpful to verify by calculating LCM and GCF separately.\n- Prime factorization is a solid method that usually gives clear insight but can be cumbersome with larger numbers.\n- Listing multiples and factors is straightforward but can be time-consuming, especially if the numbers are large.\n\n**Decision:** \n- I think starting with **prime factorization** to find LCM and GCF would not only give the correct answer but also deepen my understanding. Then, I can verify using the relationship formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's break down both numbers into their prime factors. This should help in finding both LCM and GCF.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 20:**\n  - \\(20 = 2 \\times 10\\)\n  - \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\)\n  - **So,** \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5^1\\)\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 90:**\n  - \\(90 = 9 \\times 10\\)\n  - \\(9 = 3^2\\)\n  - \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\)\n  - **So,** \\(90 = 2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\)\n\n**Self-Check:**\n- Does this factorization look correct?\n  - Yes, both 20 and 90 are decomposed into prime numbers.\n  \n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe GCF is found by taking the lowest power of common prime factors.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Common Prime Factors:**\n  - Both 20 and 90 have the primes 2 and 5.\n\n- **Their Lowest Powers:**\n  - \\(2^1\\)\n  - \\(5^1\\)\n\n- **So,** \n  - \\( \\text{GCF} = 2^1 \\times 5^1 = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, does 10 seem like a common factor of both 20 and 90?\n  - Yes, 10 divides both 20 and 90 without leaving a remainder.\n\n**Check:**\n- I can quickly verify:\n  - \\(20 \u00f7 10 = 2\\)\n  - \\(90 \u00f7 10 = 9\\)\n  \n**Conclusion:**\n- The GCF is indeed **10**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe LCM is found by taking the highest power of all prime factors present in either number.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Prime Factors Involved:**\n  - 2, 3, and 5\n\n- **Their Highest Powers:**\n  - \\(2^2\\) from 20\n  - \\(3^2\\) from 90\n  - \\(5^1\\) from both\n\n- **So,**\n  - \\( \\text{LCM} = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\)\n\n- **Calculating:**\n  - \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n  - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n  - \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n  - Multiply them together: \n    - \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\)\n    - \\(36 \\times 5 = 180\\)\n  - **So,** \\( \\text{LCM} = 180 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Let me quickly check if 180 is a multiple of both 20 and 90.\n  - \\(180 \u00f7 20 = 9\\) (integer)\n  - \\(180 \u00f7 90 = 2\\) (integer)\n\n**Check:**\n- Yes, 180 is a multiple of both, so the LCM seems correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The LCM is **180**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Relationship**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAccording to the formula \\( \\text{LCM} \u00d7 \\text{GCF} = \\text{Product of the Two Numbers} \\), let's see if our LCM and GCF satisfy this.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **LCM \u00d7 GCF:**\n  - \\(180 \u00d7 10 = 1800\\)\n\n- **Product of 20 and 90:**\n  - \\(20 \u00d7 90 = 1800\\)\n\n**Check:**\n- Both sides are equal:\n  - \\(1800 = 1800\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This confirms that our LCM and GCF were correctly calculated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The relationship holds true, validating our earlier calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Check**\n\n- **Has the approach worked?**\n  - Yes, breaking down into prime factors helped in accurately finding both GCF and LCM.\n  \n- **Is there a simpler method?**\n  - Perhaps using the relationship formula initially could have saved time, but learning the prime factorization method reinforces understanding.\n\n- **Would listing multiples and factors be practical?**\n  - For smaller numbers, it\u2019s feasible, but for larger numbers, it can be cumbersome.\n\n- **Any mistakes or revisions needed?**\n  - No mistakes found; the calculations align with the expected outcomes.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe product of the least common multiple and the greatest common factor of **20** and **90** is **1800**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstormed different strategies**: Chose prime factorization for clarity and verification.\n- **Calculated GCF and LCM separately**: Ensured accuracy by checking each step.\n- **Verified the relationship formula**: Confirmed that \\( \\text{LCM} \u00d7 \\text{GCF} = \\text{Product of the Two Numbers} \\).\n- **Reflected and checked throughout**: Made sure each part made sense and corrected where necessary.\n\nBy approaching it step by step and continuously checking my work, I ensured that the final answer was accurate and well-founded.",

  "ground_truth": "Note that 10 divides both 20 and 90. However, no bigger number can divide 20 except for 20, yet 20 does not divide 90. Therefore, 10 is the greatest common factor of 20 and 90. Similarly, note that 180 is a multiple of both 20 and 90, but the only smaller multiple of 90 is 90, so therefore 180 is the least common multiple of 20 and 90. Therefore, the product of the least common multiple and the greatest common factor of $20$ and $90$ is $10\\cdot 180=\\boxed{1800}$.  Note that this product equals the product of 20 and 90.  Is this a coincidence?"
