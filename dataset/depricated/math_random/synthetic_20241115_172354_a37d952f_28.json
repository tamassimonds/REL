    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would naturally as a human problem-solver. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Okay, the problem is about a quadratic equation: \\(3x^2 + 4x - 9\\).\n- It mentions that this quadratic has two real roots. That's good because it implies the discriminant is positive, which is a detail I might need later.\n- The goal is to find the **sum of the squares of these roots** and express the answer as a common fraction in lowest terms.\n  \n**Brainstorming:**\n- To find the sum of the squares of the roots, I remember a relation involving the roots of quadratics.\n- I could use the **Quadratic Formula** to find the roots directly, but that seems a bit involved. Maybe there's a more straightforward way.\n- Another approach might be using **Vieta's formulas**, which relate coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of the roots.\n- I could also consider properties of quadratics and their roots to avoid calculating the roots explicitly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Using Vieta's formulas seems promising because it directly relates the coefficients to the sums and products of the roots.\n- Alternatively, recalling that the sum of squares of roots can be derived from the sum and product of roots also sounds familiar.\n\n**Need to Decide:**\n- Should I proceed with Vieta's formulas, or try to calculate the roots using the Quadratic Formula first?\n- Given that the sum of squares relates directly to Vieta's formulas, perhaps starting there would be more efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Using Vieta's Formulas**\n\n- Vieta's formulas tell us that for a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\):\n  - The sum of the roots \\(r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{b}{a}\\)\n  - The product of the roots \\(r_1 \\cdot r_2 = \\frac{c}{a}\\)\n\n**Strategy 2: Calculating Roots Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n- The Quadratic Formula gives the roots as:\n  \\[\n  r_{1,2} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both strategies are valid, but using Vieta's formulas seems more direct for finding the sum of the squares without needing to find the individual roots.\n- However, let's keep both strategies in mind in case one leads to complications.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Applying Strategy 1: Vieta's Formulas**\n\n**Step A: Recall the Formula for Sum of Squares of Roots**\n\n- There's a useful relation:\n  \\[\n  r_1^2 + r_2^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 2r_1r_2\n  \\]\n  \n**Thought Process:**\n- This formula connects the sum and product of the roots to their squares.\n- So, if I can find \\( (r_1 + r_2)^2 \\) and \\( 2r_1r_2 \\), I can easily compute \\( r_1^2 + r_2^2 \\).\n\n**Step B: Compute \\( (r_1 + r_2)^2 \\) and \\( r_1 \\cdot r_2 \\)**\n\n- From Vieta's:\n  - Sum of roots: \\( r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{4}{3} \\)\n  - Product of roots: \\( r_1 \\cdot r_2 = -3 \\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n(r_1 + r_2)^2 = \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16}{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n2r_1r_2 = 2 \\times (-3) = -6\n\\]\n\n**Step C: Substitute into the Sum of Squares Formula**\n\n\\[\nr_1^2 + r_2^2 = \\frac{16}{9} - (-6) = \\frac{16}{9} + 6\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{16}{9} + \\frac{54}{9} = \\frac{70}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me quickly check if each step makes sense.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- \\( (r_1 + r_2)^2 = \\frac{16}{9} \\): Correct, since \\( (-\\frac{4}{3})^2 = \\frac{16}{9} \\).\n- \\( 2r_1r_2 = -6 \\): Correct, multiplying \\( -3 \\) by \\( 2 \\).\n\n- Adding \\( \\frac{16}{9} \\) and \\( \\frac{54}{9} \\) gives \\( \\frac{70}{9} \\): Seems correct.\n\n**Conclusion So Far:**\n- The sum of the squares of the roots calculates to \\( \\frac{70}{9} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Verifying with Strategy 2: Quadratic Formula Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To ensure accuracy, let's compute the roots using the Quadratic Formula and then directly calculate \\( r_1^2 + r_2^2 \\).\n\n**Step A: Find the Discriminant**\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4 \\times 3 \\times (-9) = 16 + 108 = 124\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The discriminant is positive (\\( \\Delta = 124 \\)), confirming that there are two real roots.\n\n**Step B: Compute the Roots Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n\\[\nr_{1,2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{124}}{6} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{31}}{6} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{31}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- So, the roots are \\( r_1 = \\frac{-2 + \\sqrt{31}}{3} \\) and \\( r_2 = \\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{31}}{3} \\).\n- Now, let's compute \\( r_1^2 + r_2^2 \\) directly to verify our earlier result.\n\n**Step C: Calculate \\( r_1^2 + r_2^2 \\)**\n\n\\[\nr_1^2 = \\left(\\frac{-2 + \\sqrt{31}}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(-2 + \\sqrt{31})^2}{9} = \\frac{4 - 4\\sqrt{31} + 31}{9} = \\frac{35 - 4\\sqrt{31}}{9}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_2^2 = \\left(\\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{31}}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(-2 - \\sqrt{31})^2}{9} = \\frac{4 + 4\\sqrt{31} + 31}{9} = \\frac{35 + 4\\sqrt{31}}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Adding Them Together:**\n\\[\nr_1^2 + r_2^2 = \\frac{35 - 4\\sqrt{31}}{9} + \\frac{35 + 4\\sqrt{31}}{9} = \\frac{70}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both strategies yield the same result: \\( \\frac{70}{9} \\).\n- This consistency reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since both approaches lead to the same answer, I can be confident that \\( \\frac{70}{9} \\) is indeed the correct sum of the squares of the roots.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Vieta's approach was efficient and aligned with the properties of quadratics.\n- The Quadratic Formula method, while more involved, confirmed the result.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The sum of the squares of the roots of the quadratic \\(3x^2 + 4x - 9\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{70}{9}}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Reflecting on the Process**\n\n**Realization:**\n- Initially, I thought about using the Quadratic Formula, but recalling Vieta's formulas provided a quicker and more direct path to the solution.\n\n**Mistakes:**\n- At first, I didn't consider Vieta's relation for the sum of squares, which led me to think of calculating the roots directly.\n\n**Aha Moment:**\n- Recognizing that \\( r_1^2 + r_2^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 2r_1r_2 \\) made the problem much simpler and avoided unnecessary computations.\n\n**Learning:**\n- Leveraging known formulas and relationships can streamline problem-solving, especially in familiar domains like quadratics.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n- It's always beneficial to rethink the approach and consider multiple strategies, as it can lead to more efficient solutions and verify the correctness through consistency.\n\nAnd there you have it\u2014a step-by-step, human-like exploration and solution of the problem, complete with brainstorming, strategy exploration, reflection, and verification.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of the equation $3x^2+4x-9$. We want to find $x_1^2+x_2^2$. Note that $x_1^2+x_2^2=(x_1+x_2)^2-2x_1x_2$. We know that $x_1+x_2$, the sum of the roots, is equal to $\\frac{-b}{a}$, which for this equation is $\\frac{-4}{3}$. Likewise, we know that $x_1x_2$, the product of the roots, is equal to $\\frac{c}{a}$, which for this equation is $\\frac{-9}{3}$. Thus, $x_1^2+x_2^2=\\left(\\frac{-4}{3}\\right)^2-2\\left(\\frac{-9}{3}\\right)=\\frac{16}{9}+\\frac{18}{3}=\\boxed{\\frac{70}{9}}$."
