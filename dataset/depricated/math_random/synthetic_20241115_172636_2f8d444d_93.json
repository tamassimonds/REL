    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe problem states that the United States Postal Service charges an extra \\$0.11 in postage if the ratio of the length to the height of an envelope is **less than 1.3** or **greater than 2.5**. We need to determine how many of the given four envelopes require this additional charge.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Ratio Calculation:** I immediately think about calculating the length-to-height ratio for each envelope.\n- **Comparison:** After finding the ratio, I\u2019ll compare it to the thresholds (1.3 and 2.5) to see which envelopes fall outside this range.\n- **Check for Edge Cases:** Maybe check if exactly 1.3 or 2.5 qualifies for extra charge\u2014though the problem seems clear that only less than 1.3 or greater than 2.5 qualifies.\n\n**Wait, I need to make sure:** Does the charge apply for **less than or equal to 1.3** and **greater than or equal to 2.5**? The wording states \"less than 1.3 or greater than 2.5,\" so it looks like only **strictly** less than 1.3 and **strictly** greater than 2.5 qualify. I\u2019ll proceed with this understanding.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Length-to-Height Ratio for Each Envelope**\n\nLet\u2019s compute the ratio for each envelope one by one.\n\n**Envelope A:**\n- **Length:** 6 inches\n- **Height:** 4 inches\n- **Ratio Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Ratio}_A = \\frac{\\text{Length}}{\\text{Height}} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\n  \\]\n\n**Checking:**  \n1.5 is greater than 1.3 and less than 2.5, so it **does not** qualify for the extra charge.\n\n**Envelope B:**\n- **Length:** 9 inches\n- **Height:** 3 inches\n- **Ratio Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Ratio}_B = \\frac{9}{3} = 3\n  \\]\n\n**Checking:**  \n3 is greater than 2.5, so it **does** require the extra charge.\n\n**Envelope C:**\n- **Length:** 6 inches\n- **Height:** 6 inches\n- **Ratio Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Ratio}_C = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n  \\]\n\n**Checking:**  \n1 is less than 1.3, so it **does** require the extra charge.\n\n**Envelope D:**\n- **Length:** 11 inches\n- **Height:** 4 inches\n- **Ratio Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Ratio}_D = \\frac{11}{4} = 2.75\n  \\]\n\n**Checking:**  \n2.75 is greater than 2.5, so it **does** require the extra charge.\n\n### **Reflection:**  \nSo far, Envelopes B, C, and D require the extra charge. Envelope A does not.\n\n**But wait, let\u2019s double-check:**  \n- Envelope B: Ratio 3 \u2192 **Correct.**\n- Envelope C: Ratio 1 \u2192 **Correct.**\n- Envelope D: Ratio 2.75 \u2192 **Correct.**\n\nAll checks align with the criteria.\n\n### **Step 2: Verify the Charge Application Criteria**\n\nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s make sure I interpreted the charge application criteria correctly.\n\n**Does the charge apply only for strictly less than 1.3 or greater than 2.5?**  \nThe problem states \u201c**less than 1.3 or greater than 2.5**,\u201d which implies that exactly 1.3 and 2.5 do **not** qualify. This aligns with how I interpreted it initially.\n\n**Is there any ambiguity?**  \nNo, the wording seems clear. Therefore, our calculations stand.\n\n### **Step 3: Finalizing the Count of Envelopes Requiring Extra Charge**\n\nBased on the calculations:\n- **Envelope A:** No extra charge\n- **Envelope B:** Extra charge\n- **Envelope C:** Extra charge\n- **Envelope D:** Extra charge\n\n**Total Envelopes Requiring Extra Charge:**  \n3 out of 4 envelopes need the extra \\$0.11.\n\n### **But let\u2019s be meticulous:**  \n- **Three envelopes have ratios outside the specified range.**\n- **One envelope (A) is within the range and does not require an extra charge.**\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### **Final Reflection:**  \n- **Approach:** Calculating the length-to-height ratio was straightforward and effective.\n- **Checking:** Ensuring the charge criteria were correctly interpreted helped confirm the correctness.\n- **Result:** Three envelopes require the extra charge.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**\\(\\boxed{3}\\)**\u2014Three envelopes must pay the extra \\$0.11 in postage.\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**  \n- **Brainstorming Helped:** Initially, I considered different strategies like checking both length and height separately, but focusing on the ratio was the most direct approach.\n- **Reflection Was Crucial:** Double-checking the charge application criteria ensured I didn\u2019t misinterpret the problem.\n- **Mistakes and Adjustments:** Initially, I briefly considered whether exact 1.3 or 2.5 would qualify but quickly clarified that only strict inequalities apply.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with continuous checking and reflection, led to a confident and accurate solution.",
