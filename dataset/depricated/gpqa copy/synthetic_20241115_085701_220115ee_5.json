    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem together, step by step, just like we would if we were brainstorming in real life.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have a multi-step chemical reaction here:\n\n1. **(3r,5r,7r)-adamantane-1-carboxylic acid + A \u2192 (3r,5r,7r)-adamantane-1-carbonyl azide**\n2. **(3r,5r,7r)-adamantane-1-carbonyl azide + B \u2192 (3s,5s,7s)-adamantan-1-amine**\n\nAnd we need to identify the missing reagents **A** and **B** from the given options.\n\n**Options:**\n- (A) A = diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) and B = H\u2083O\u207a, Heat\n- (B) A = NaN\u2083 and B = HCl aq, Heat\n- (C) A = diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) and B = NaN\u2083\n- (D) A = PCl\u2085 and B = H\u2083O\u207a, Heat\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This looks like a conversion from a carboxylic acid to an amine via a carbonyl azide intermediate. \n- Reminds me of the **Curtius Rearrangement** or perhaps the **Hofmann Rearrangement**, both of which involve converting acyl derivatives to amines.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. It's better to explore different strategies to ensure we're on the right path.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Understanding the First Step:**\n   - We start with a carboxylic acid and need to convert it to a carbonyl azide.\n   - What reagents are typically used for this conversion?\n\n2. **Exploring the Second Step:**\n   - From a carbonyl azide to an amine with a change in stereochemistry (from (3r,5r,7r) to (3s,5s,7s)).\n   - How does this inversion occur? Is heat involved? \n\n3. **Matching Reagents to Known Reactions:**\n   - Associating each option with known chemical reactions to see if they fit the steps.\n\n4. **Checking for Stereochemistry Changes:**\n   - Ensuring that the reagents not only facilitate the conversion but also account for the change in stereochemistry.\n\nAlright, let's dive deeper into each step, reflecting often to ensure we're on the correct path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Converting Carboxylic Acid to Carbonyl Azide**\n\n**Goal:**  \n(3r,5r,7r)-adamantane-1-carboxylic acid \u2192 (3r,5r,7r)-adamantane-1-carbonyl azide\n\n**Possible Reagents:**\n- **Diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA)**\n- **NaN\u2083 (Sodium azide)**\n- **PCl\u2085 (Phosphorus pentachloride)**\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n- **DPPA** is commonly used in the Curtius Rearrangement to convert acyl chlorides or anhydrides to acyl azides.\n- **NaN\u2083** is often used in azide substitutions but typically requires an acyl halide or anhydride to react with.\n- **PCl\u2085** is a chlorinating agent, converting carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides.\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\n- Our starting material is a **carboxylic acid**. To use NaN\u2083, we'd likely need to first convert the acid to an acyl chloride.\n\n**Brainwave:**\n- Maybe we need a two-step process where the carboxylic acid is first converted to an acyl chloride, which then reacts with NaN\u2083 to form the carbonyl azide.\n\n**Testing This Idea:**\n- If we use **PCl\u2085** to convert the carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride:\n  - *(3r,5r,7r)-adamantane-1-carboxylic acid + PCl\u2085 \u2192 (3r,5r,7r)-adamantane-1-carbonyl chloride + HCl + POCl\u2083)*\n- Then, the acyl chloride could react with **NaN\u2083** to form the carbonyl azide:\n  - *(3r,5r,7r)-adamantane-1-carbonyl chloride + NaN\u2083 \u2192 (3r,5r,7r)-adamantane-1-carbonyl azide + NaCl)*\n\n**Reflection:**\n- But wait, the problem only provides for **A** in the first step. So maybe we're overcomplicating things.\n- **DPPA** can directly convert carboxylic acids to acyl azides without needing to form an acyl chloride intermediate.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:**\n- **A = Diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA)**\n- This aligns with the **Curtius Rearrangement**, where DPPA converts carboxylic acids directly to acyl azides.\n\n**Checking the Options:**\n- Only Options **(A)** and **(C)** have **A = DPPA**.\n- Options **(B)** and **(D)** are ruled out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Converting Carbonyl Azide to Amine with Stereochemical Inversion**\n\n**Goal:**  \n(3r,5r,7r)-adamantane-1-carbonyl azide \u2192 (3s,5s,7s)-adamantan-1-amine\n\n**Remaining Options:**\n- (A) B = **H\u2083O\u207a, Heat**\n- (C) B = **NaN\u2083**\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n- The Curtius Rearrangement involves the thermal decomposition of acyl azides to form isocyanates, which can then be hydrolyzed to amines.\n- **Heat** is definitely involved in the rearrangement.\n- **H\u2083O\u207a (acidic conditions)** would facilitate the hydrolysis of the isocyanate to the amine.\n\n**But What About NaN\u2083?**\n- **NaN\u2083** is not typically used in the second step of the Curtius Rearrangement.\n- It doesn\u2019t fit well here because we\u2019re looking to convert the azide to an amine, and NaN\u2083 doesn\u2019t assist in this transformation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Option **(C)** doesn\u2019t make sense because using NaN\u2083 after forming the carbonyl azide doesn\u2019t align with the Curtius Rearrangement pathway.\n\n**Final Conclusion for Step 2:**\n- **B = H\u2083O\u207a, Heat**\n- The combination of heat and acidic conditions (H\u2083O\u207a) will promote the rearrangement and hydrolysis to form the amine with stereochemical inversion.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- **Option (A)**:\n  - A = Diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA)\n  - B = H\u2083O\u207a, Heat\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Does Option (A) Align with the Curtius Rearrangement?**\n  - **Yes.** DPPA converts the carboxylic acid to the acyl azide.\n  - The acyl azide, under heat, rearranges to form an isocyanate.\n  - H\u2083O\u207a facilitates the hydrolysis of the isocyanate to the amine.\n  \n- **Does the Stereochemistry Change Make Sense?**\n  - **Yes.** The Curtius Rearrangement can lead to inversion of configuration due to the migratory aptitude and the nature of the rearrangement process.\n\n- **Are Other Options Feasible?**\n  - **(B) NaN\u2083 and HCl aq, Heat:** NaN\u2083 is not suitable for directly converting carboxylic acids to carbonyl azides without an acyl chloride intermediate.\n  - **(C) NaN\u2083 as B:** Doesn\u2019t fit the second step.\n  - **(D) PCl\u2085 and H\u2083O\u207a, Heat:** PCl\u2085 would convert the carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride, but without NaN\u2083 or another azide source, the acyl azide wouldn\u2019t form.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- Option **(A)** is the only choice that logically completes the reaction sequence via the Curtius Rearrangement, accounting for both the formation of the carbonyl azide and its subsequent conversion to the amine with stereochemical inversion.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n**(A) A = diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) and B = H\u2083O\u207a, Heat**\n\n---\n\nAnd that\u2019s how we systematically arrive at the correct answer by exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and ensuring consistency with known chemical processes.",
