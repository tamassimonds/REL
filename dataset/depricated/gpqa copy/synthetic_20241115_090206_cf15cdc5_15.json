    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process step by step, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's see where it takes us!\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have three planets orbiting the same star with periods of 22, 40, and 64 days. They're all in the same orbital plane, and we need to find out when they all transit the star simultaneously\u2014basically, when their transits line up.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This reminds me of problems involving finding common periods or harmonics. Maybe it's about finding a common multiple?\n- Could the Least Common Multiple (LCM) be relevant here? It's the smallest time when all cycles align.\n- Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider relative positions or phases of the planets.\n\nI think starting with the LCM approach makes sense, but I'll keep an eye out if this doesn't lead me in the right direction.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy: Least Common Multiple (LCM)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf each planet transits the star every 22, 40, and 64 days, respectively, the triple transit would occur when all three cycles align. The smallest such time would be the LCM of their periods.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate LCM of 22, 40, and 64**\n\n- **Factorization Method:**\n  - Break down each number into its prime factors:\n    - 22 = 2 \u00d7 11\n    - 40 = 2\u00b3 \u00d7 5\n    - 64 = 2\u2076\n  - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime:\n    - 2\u2076 (from 64)\n    - 11 (from 22)\n    - 5 (from 40)\n  - Multiply them together:  \n    \\[\n    \\text{LCM} = 2\u2076 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 5 = 64 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 5 = 704 \u00d7 5 = 3520\n    \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, according to this, the LCM is **3520 days**. Let's see if this matches one of the given options.\n\n**Checking Against Options:**\n\n(A) 3520 days  \n(B) 2560 days  \n(C) 56320 days  \n(D) 28160 days  \n\nOption (A) matches our calculation. But before finalizing, let's double-check to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n### **Double-Checking the Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI want to verify my LCM calculation to ensure accuracy. Let me re-factorize the numbers and confirm the multiplication.\n\n**Re-Factorization:**\n\n- 22 = 2 \u00d7 11 \u2714\ufe0f\n- 40 = 2\u00b3 \u00d7 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n- 64 = 2\u2076 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Re-Calculating LCM:**\n\n- Highest powers:\n  - 2\u2076 = 64\n  - 11 = 11\n  - 5 = 5\n- Multiply:  \n  \\[\n  64 \u00d7 11 = 704  \n  704 \u00d7 5 = 3520  \n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does 3520 divide evenly by 22, 40, and 64?\n  - 3520 \u00f7 22 = 160 \u2714\ufe0f\n  - 3520 \u00f7 40 = 88 \u2714\ufe0f\n  - 3520 \u00f7 64 = 55 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll divisions result in whole numbers, confirming that **3520 days** is indeed the LCM.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Sequential Alignment**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWhile the LCM approach seems correct, let's briefly consider another method to ensure robustness. Maybe sequentially aligning the planets' transits could offer a different perspective.\n\n**Sequential Alignment Approach:**\n\n- Start with the first two planets (22 and 40 days).\n- Find their LCM:  \n  \\[\n  22 = 2 \u00d7 11  \n  40 = 2\u00b3 \u00d7 5  \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{LCM} = 2\u00b3 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 5 = 880  \n  \\]\n- Now, align the third planet (64 days) with the LCM of the first two:\n  \\[\n  880 = 2\u00b3 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 5  \n  64 = 2\u2076  \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{LCM of 880 and 64} = 2\u2076 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 5 = 3520  \n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis alternative method also leads us to **3520 days**. It reinforces the initial conclusion, adding confidence to the answer.\n\n### **Final Checks and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, I want to ensure that both methods agree and that no steps were overlooked.\n\n- Both the direct LCM calculation and the sequential alignment approach yield **3520 days**.\n- The calculations have been double-checked for accuracy.\n- The result matches one of the provided options.\n\n**User Option Selection:**\n\nBased on the calculations and verification, the periodicity of a triple transit is **3520 days**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3520 \\text{ days (Option A)}}\n\\]\n\n### **Wrap-Up**\n\nBy approaching the problem systematically\u2014starting with the LCM method, double-checking calculations, exploring an alternative strategy, and ensuring consistency across methods\u2014we confidently arrive at the answer. This thorough process helps in minimizing errors and solidifying the correctness of the solution.",
