  "problem": "Does a 5-sided square exist?",
  "solution": "### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. **Does a 5-sided square exist?** At first glance, this seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I fully understand the question. A square, as I recall, is a shape with equal sides and equal angles. But adding a fifth side... hmm, that sounds off. \n\nLet me jot down my initial thoughts:\n\n- **Wait a minute**, isn't a square supposed to have only four sides? \n- **Maybe** this is a trick question, or perhaps there's a special case I'm not aware of.\n- **Could it be** that a 5-sided figure resembles a square in some way?\n- **Alternatively**, is it possible that the term \u201csquare\u201d is being used differently here?\n\nI'm slightly unsure, so I'll need to explore different strategies to confirm my intuition.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **1. Recalling Basic Geometry**\n\nMy first instinct is to think back to basic geometry definitions. **A square has four equal sides and four right angles.** If I add another side, does it still qualify as a square?\n\n- **Thoughts:** Adding a fifth side would disrupt the equal angles and sides. \n- **Reflection:** **Wait**, that doesn't make sense. A square by definition can't have more than four sides.\n\n#### **2. Visualizing the Shape**\n\nMaybe drawing it out will help. Let me sketch a square and try to add a fifth side.\n\n- **Thoughts:** As I try to add a fifth side, the shape no longer maintains equal angles or sides.\n- **Reflection:** **Hmm**, this definitely doesn't look like a square anymore. It resembles more of a pentagon.\n\n#### **3. Considering Special Cases**\n\nPerhaps there's a special type of square that allows for five sides?\n\n- **Thoughts:** I've never heard of such a thing, but maybe in higher dimensions or abstract geometry?\n- **Reflection:** **Actually**, that seems unlikely. In two-dimensional geometry, a square is strictly four-sided.\n\n#### **4. Consulting Geometric Definitions**\n\nLet me refer to formal definitions to be sure.\n\n- **Thoughts:** According to geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral with four equal sides and angles.\n- **Reflection:** **Okay**, this confirms that a square cannot have more than four sides.\n\n### **Checking the Initial Approach**\n\nGiven these strategies, my initial thought that a square inherently has four sides seems correct. But I want to make sure by considering other possibilities.\n\n- **Quick Check:** If a square had five sides, would it still have equal angles and sides? \n  - **Answer:** No, adding another side would violate the properties of a square.\n\n- **Deeper Reflection:** Is there any geometric principle that allows for a five-sided square?\n  - **Answer:** No standard geometric principles support a five-sided square.\n\n### **Exploring an Alternative Approach**\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider higher-dimensional shapes or abstract geometry.\n\n- **Thoughts:** In three dimensions, a cube has six faces, each a square. But that's still four-sided squares making up the faces.\n- **Reflection:** **Wait**, even in higher dimensions, a square remains four-sided. A five-sided figure is something else entirely, like a pentagon.\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies\u2014recalling basic geometry, visualizing the shape, considering special cases, and consulting formal definitions\u2014it's clear that a square cannot have five sides. Any attempt to add a fifth side transforms the shape into something other than a square, violating its fundamental properties.\n\n<ANSWER>solution</ANSWER>\n\n**Summary:** A 5-sided square does not exist. By definition, a square is a four-sided polygon (quadrilateral) with equal sides and angles. Adding a fifth side changes its fundamental properties, making it no longer a square.",
