  "problem": "If a doctor gives you three pills and tells you to take one every half hour, how long will they last?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem exactly as I would naturally\u2014thinking it through step by step, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and adjusting my approach as needed. Here's how I'd tackle it.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the question is:  \n**\u201cIf a doctor gives you three pills and tells you to take one every half hour, how long will they last?\u201d**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \nHmm, at first glance, it seems straightforward. I need to take three pills, each half an hour apart. But wait, does that mean they'll last for 1.5 hours? Let me think it through...\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Simple Addition:**  \n   - Add up the intervals between taking each pill.\n\n2. **Timeline Visualization:**  \n   - Draw a timeline to visualize when each pill is taken.\n\n3. **Sequential Counting:**  \n   - Count the time starting from when the first pill is taken.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \nI think exploring multiple strategies will help ensure I arrive at the correct answer. If one doesn't work, I can pivot to another.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Simple Addition**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \nOkay, if I take a pill every 30 minutes and there are three pills, does that mean 3 \u00d7 30 minutes = 90 minutes (1.5 hours)?\n\n- **Wait a Minute:**  \nBut hold on\u2014does the timing start with the first pill, or is it only the intervals between pills that add up? This is a bit confusing.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \nActually, I might be overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach to see if this makes sense.\n\n### **Switching to Strategy 2: Timeline Visualization**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \nLet's draw a mental timeline to map out when each pill is taken.\n\n- **Starting Point:**  \n  - **Time 0:** Take the first pill.\n  - **After 30 minutes:** Take the second pill.\n  - **After another 30 minutes (60 minutes total):** Take the third pill.\n\n- **Check:**  \nSo, the last pill is taken at 60 minutes. Does that mean the pills last for 1 hour?\n\n- **Reflection:**  \nThis seems more logical. The total time from the first pill to the last is 60 minutes.\n\n### **Double-Checking with Strategy 3: Sequential Counting**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s count the intervals to see if it matches.\n\n- **Interval 1:**  \n  - From the first to the second pill: 30 minutes.\n\n- **Interval 2:**  \n  - From the second to the third pill: another 30 minutes.\n\n- **Total Time:**  \n  - 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes.\n\n- **Check:**  \nYup, it adds up to 60 minutes.\n\n### **Final Reflection: Is This Correct?**\n\n- **Wait, Is That Right?**  \nInitially, I thought it would be 1.5 hours, but now I see it's only 1 hour. The confusion came from misinterpreting the number of intervals versus the number of pills.\n\n- **Brainstorm Moment:**  \nOh! I get it now\u2014there are only two intervals between the three pills, not three intervals.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Answer:**  \n<ANSWER>The pills will last for 1 hour (60 minutes).</ANSWER>\n\n- **Final Check:**  \nBy starting at time zero and taking a pill every 30 minutes, the last pill is taken at the 60-minute mark. This confirms that the total duration is 1 hour.\n\n### **Wrapping Up**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \nInitially, I miscalculated by thinking each pill added an extra half hour, but visualizing the timeline clarified that there are only two intervals.\n\n- **Lesson Learned:**  \nAlways consider the starting point and count the intervals between actions, not just the actions themselves.\n\n---\n\nThat's how I'd approach it step by step, checking each method, reflecting, and adjusting my strategy until I arrived at the correct answer.",
