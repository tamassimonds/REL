  "solution": "Absolutely, let's streamline the thought process while maintaining the original insights. Here's how it unfolds:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **What exactly is being asked?**  \n  We need to determine how many times the digit *5* appears between 1 and 100.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\n- This seems straightforward, but **I need to consider both the tens and units places.**  \n  **Oh!** So, it's about counting every occurrence, not just numbers with a single *5*.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n---\n\n**First Thought:**\n\n- **Maybe I can just list all the numbers from 1 to 100 and count the 5s.**  \n  But wait, that might be too time-consuming. Is there a more efficient way?\n\n**Alternative Strategies:**\n\n1. **Listing Out Numbers:**  \n   Write down each number and mark where *5* appears.\n   \n2. **Counting Digit Places Separately:**  \n   Count how many times *5* appears in the units place and then in the tens place.\n\n3. **Using Mathematical Patterns:**  \n   Recognize patterns or intervals where *5* appears regularly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Hmm...** Listing out might take too long, especially if the range increases.  \n  **Counting digit places separately seems more efficient.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring the Second Strategy (Counting Digit Places Separately)**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's **count how often *5* appears in the units place first.**  \n  Then, count how often *5* appears in the tens place.  \n  Finally, **add both counts together.**\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**\n\n- **I think so.** By separating the two places, I can ensure I don't miss any occurrences.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Counting the Units Place**\n\n---\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- The units digit repeats every 10 numbers (e.g., 0-9, 10-19, etc.).\n  \n**Calculation:**\n\n- From 1 to 100, there are 10 complete sets (0-9, 10-19, ..., 90-99).  \n- In each set of 10 numbers, *5* appears **once in the units place** (e.g., 5, 15, 25, etc.).\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Units Place 5s} = 10 \\text{ sets} \\times 1 = 10\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Wait a minute...** What about the number 100?  \n  **Oh right!** The units digit there is 0, so it doesn't add another *5*.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Counting the Tens Place**\n\n---\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Now, **count how often *5* appears in the tens place.**  \n  This occurs in the numbers 50-59.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- There are **10 numbers from 50 to 59** where *5* is in the tens place.\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Tens Place 5s} = 10\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does that cover all occurrences?**  \n  Yes, because the tens digit repeats every 100 numbers, and we're only going up to 100.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Adding Both Counts Together**\n\n---\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n\n- Units Place: **10**  \n- Tens Place: **10**  \n- \\[\n  \\text{Total 5s} = 10 + 10 = 20\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, is that correct?**  \n  **Hmm...** Let's think about it again. Each occurrence is accounted for separately, so **it seems right.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying the Approach**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **But what if I'm double-counting?**  \n  **No, because** the units and tens places are independent in this counting method.\n\n**Alternative Check:**\n\n- **Maybe I should list a few numbers to verify.**\n\n  - **List from 1 to 20:**  \n    - 5, 15 (units place)  \n    - No tens place *5* until 50-59.\n  \n  - **List from 50 to 59:**  \n    - 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 (tens place)  \n    - Plus, **55 has two 5s.**\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n- **Oh!** So, in 55, both the units and tens have *5*, but our method already accounts for that separately.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Conclusion**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n- \\[\n  \\boxed{20}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, did I cover all possibilities?**  \n  **Yes, by counting both the units and tens places separately, all occurrences of the digit 5 are accounted for.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does the total seem reasonable?**  \n  **Absolutely.** Ten occurrences in the units place and ten in the tens place add up correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Final Thoughts**\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Did exploring different strategies help?**  \n  **Yes, starting with listing but then realizing counting digit places separately was more efficient ensured accuracy.**\n\n- **Does the approach generalize well?**  \n  **Definitely.** This method can be applied to any range by adjusting the number of sets and counting digit places accordingly.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- By carefully considering both digit places and verifying through listing, the total number of times the digit *5* appears between 1 and 100 is **20**.\n\n---\n\nAnd there you have it! By thoroughly exploring different strategies and verifying each step, we've confidently arrived at the correct answer: **20**.",
