  "problem": "If a doctor gives you three pills and tells you to take one every half hour, how long will they last?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's organize the thought process into a clear and complete solution while maintaining the original answer.\n\n---\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dig into this. The question is:\n\n*If a doctor gives you three pills and tells you to take one every half hour, how long will they last?*\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Hmm, this seems straightforward, but I recall similar problems where the timing can be tricky. At first glance, it looks like three pills taken every half hour should last an hour and a half, but I\u2019m not entirely sure. Let me brainstorm a bit.\n\n---\n\n**Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Simple Addition:** Just add half an hour for each pill.\n   \n2. **Timeline Approach:** Visualize a timeline to see when each pill is taken.\n   \n3. **Counting Intervals vs. Pills:** Maybe it's about counting the intervals between taking the pills, not just the pills themselves.\n\n- **Thought Process:** I think using a timeline might help me visualize better. Let's start there.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Exploring the Timeline Approach**\n\n- **Idea:** Create a simple timeline to map out when each pill is taken.\n\n- **Reflection:** If I start taking the first pill at time zero, I need to see how the next pills follow.\n\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yeah, mapping it out should clarify the timing.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Drawing the Timeline**\n\n- **Start Time:** Let's say I take the **first pill at 0 minutes** (right when I receive them).\n\n- **Wait Half an Hour:** So, the **second pill at 30 minutes**.\n\n- **Wait Another Half Hour:** Finally, the **third pill at 60 minutes**.\n\n- **Total Duration:** From 0 to 60 minutes.\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait a minute, that's only **one hour**. But I initially thought it might be longer. Hmm, interesting.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does this align with the total time? Yup, one hour from start to finish.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Verifying with Counting Intervals**\n\n- **New Approach:** Let's see if counting the intervals between pills gives the same result.\n\n- **First Interval:** From the first pill to the second \u2014 **30 minutes**.\n\n- **Second Interval:** From the second pill to the third \u2014 another **30 minutes**.\n\n- **Total Intervals:** Two intervals of 30 minutes each = **60 minutes** total.\n\n- **Reflection:** Okay, this confirms the timeline approach. The pills last for one hour.\n\n- **Check:** Is there any inconsistency? Nope, both strategies agree.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Considering Alternative Interpretations**\n\n- **Thinking:** Is there another way to interpret the question that might change the answer?\n\n- **Alternative View:** Maybe the doctor meant to start counting the half-hour after taking the first pill?\n\n- **Thought Process:** But that doesn\u2019t really change the total time because the first pill is taken immediately.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No matter how I look at it, the total time remains one hour.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Final Reflection and Acceptance**\n\n- **Final Check:** All strategies point to the same conclusion. The pills last for one hour.\n\n- **Reflection:** Initially, I thought it might be longer, but breaking it down step by step clarified the timing.\n\n- **Thought Process:** It\u2019s interesting how an initial assumption can be misleading. Taking the time to map it out really helps.\n\n---\n\n**<ANSWER>**\n\n**Solution:** The three pills will last for **one hour**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Learning Moment:** Even simple problems can have nuances that aren\u2019t obvious at first. Taking the time to explore different strategies and reflect on each step ensures accuracy.\n\n- **Brainstorming Benefit:** Starting with a timeline helped visualize the problem, and verifying with intervals confirmed the solution.\n\n- **Verification Importance:** Checking multiple methods prevented any misinterpretation of the question.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Embracing an exploratory approach, reflecting often, and being open to changing strategies led to a clear and correct solution.\n\n---\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the approach, we've arrived confidently at the correct solution: the three pills will last for **one hour**.",
