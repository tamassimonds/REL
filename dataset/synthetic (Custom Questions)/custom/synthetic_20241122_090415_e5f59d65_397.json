  "problem": "Does a triangle with sides 2, 2, and 5 exist?",
  "solution": "Certainly! Let's bring everything together into a coherent and complete solution, maintaining the original final answer. I'll ensure the thought process flows naturally, reflecting a genuine problem-solving journey.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, I'm presented with a triangle having sides 2, 2, and 5. **Initial Reaction:** That last side seems quite long compared to the others. It reminds me of those problems where a triangle can't exist if one side is too lengthy... but let me not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Triangle Inequality Theorem:** I recall that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the third side.\n   \n2. **Visualize the Triangle:** Perhaps drawing it out could help\u2014can two sides of length 2 connect with a side of length 5?\n\n3. **Consider It as an Isosceles Triangle:** Since two sides are equal, maybe that plays a role.\n\n**Reflection:** The Triangle Inequality Theorem seems like the most straightforward starting point. But if that doesn't yield clarity, I'll try visualizing the scenario.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Triangle Inequality Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:** Let's check if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.\n\n- **Inequality 1:** 2 + 2 ?\\(?\\geq\\)?\\(\\geq\\) 5\n- **Inequality 2:** 2 + 5 ?\\(?\\geq\\)?\\(\\geq\\) 2\n- **Inequality 3:** 2 + 5 ?\\(?\\geq\\)?\\(\\geq\\) 2\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Inequality 1:** 2 + 2 = 4 **<** 5 \u2717\n- **Inequality 2:** 2 + 5 = 7 **>** 2 \u2713\n- **Inequality 3:** 2 + 5 = 7 **>** 2 \u2713\n\n**Reflection:** Oh! The first inequality doesn't hold\u20144 is less than 5. This means the sides can't form a triangle according to the Triangle Inequality Theorem.\n\n**Quick Check:** If even one inequality fails, the triangle cannot exist. But let me think\u2014what does this mean geometrically?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Visualizing the Triangle**\n\n**Thought Process:** Maybe seeing it will help. If I draw two sides of length 2, can they even reach each other with a side of length 5?\n\n**Attempt:**\n\n- Imagine two sides of length 2 connected at one end.\n- Try to connect the other ends with a side of length 5.\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a minute\u2014if each side is only 2 units long, and I'm trying to connect them with a side that's 5 units long, there's no way they can meet. It's like attempting to touch the tips of two short sticks with a much longer one\u2014impossible!\n\n**Conclusion:** Visualizing confirms that the triangle can't exist. The sides are too short to connect with the longer side.\n\n**Check:** This aligns perfectly with the Triangle Inequality Theorem's result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering an Isosceles Triangle**\n\n**Thought Process:** Since two sides are equal, could it be an isosceles triangle? But wait, does that help here?\n\n**Attempt:**\n\n- **Base:** 5\n- **Legs:** 2 and 2\n\n**Reflection:** Even as an isosceles triangle, the same issue arises. The two shorter sides can't connect to cover the length of 5. So, this approach doesn't change the outcome.\n\n**Check:** Yup, still doesn't work. The Triangle Inequality fails regardless.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:** Am I missing something? Let's double-check by considering another method, like calculating angles using the **Cosine Law**. But does that make sense here?\n\n**Attempt:**\n\n- **Cosine Law:** c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n  \n  Plugging in:\n  \n  5\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 - 2(2)(2) * cos(C)\n  \n  25 = 4 + 4 - 8 * cos(C)\n  \n  25 = 8 - 8 * cos(C)\n  \n  17 = -8 * cos(C)\n  \n  cos(C) = -\\(\\frac{17}{8}\\) \n    \\(\\displaystyle -\\frac{17}{8}\\)\n   Negative\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, cos(C) is greater than 1 in magnitude, which doesn't make sense for a real angle. This confirms that such a triangle can't exist.\n\n**Check:** Using the Cosine Law leads to an invalid cosine value, reinforcing that the triangle is impossible.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:** All approaches\u2014Triangle Inequality, visualization, isosceles consideration, and Cosine Law\u2014consistently indicate that the triangle can't exist.\n\n**Quick Summary:**\n\n- **Triangle Inequality Theorem:** Fails (4 < 5)\n- **Visualization:** Sides can't connect\n- **Isosceles Consideration:** No change\n- **Cosine Law:** Invalid angle\n\n**Final Check:** Everything aligns. There's no conflicting information here.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution**\n\n<ANSWER>\n   \nA triangle with sides 2, 2, and 5 **does not** exist because the sum of the two shorter sides (2 + 2 = 4) is less than the longest side (5), violating the Triangle Inequality Theorem.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and confirming consistency across multiple methods, we conclusively determine that such a triangle cannot exist.",
