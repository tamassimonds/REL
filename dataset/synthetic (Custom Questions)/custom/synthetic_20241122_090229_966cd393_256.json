  "problem": "Is -10 less than -20?",
  "solution": "---\n\n# **Is \\(-10\\) Less Than \\(-20\\)?**\n\nWhenever I encounter a problem like this, I **start by getting a feel for what's being asked**. So let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n## **First Impressions and Brainstorming**\n\n**First Thought:** At first glance, I think negative numbers can be tricky. I remember learning that the more negative a number is, the smaller it is. But let me brainstorm a few strategies to make sure:\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Visualize on a number line.\n- **Strategy 2:** Compare absolute values.\n- **Strategy 3:** Use real-life examples.\n- **Strategy 4:** Perform simple arithmetic checks.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure which one will give me the clearest answer, so I'll explore each.\n\n---\n\n## **Exploring Strategies**\n\n### **Strategy 1: Visualize on a Number Line**\n\nOkay, let's picture a number line in my head. Negative numbers are to the left of zero.\n\n```\n... -30, -20, -10, 0, 10, 20, ...\n```\n\n- **Reflection:** Hmm, I see that \\(-20\\) is to the left of \\(-10\\). So, doesn't that mean \\(-20\\) is smaller?\n\nBut wait, does this mean \\(-10\\) is greater than \\(-20\\)? Let me think again.\n\n- **Conclusion from Strategy 1:** **Yes, \\(-10\\) is greater than \\(-20\\).** So, \\(-10\\) is **not** less than \\(-20\\).\n\n### **Strategy 2: Compare Absolute Values**\n\nNow, let's consider the absolute values.\n\n- **Absolute of \\(-10\\):** \\(10\\)\n- **Absolute of \\(-20\\):** \\(20\\)\n\n**Thought Process:** The absolute value of \\(-20\\) is larger, but absolute values represent distance from zero, not the actual value's position on the number line.\n\n- **Reflection:** This doesn't directly answer the question about which is less, but it reminds me that \\(-20\\) is further left on the number line.\n\n- **Conclusion from Strategy 2:** **Reinforces that \\(-10\\) is greater than \\(-20\\).**\n\n### **Strategy 3: Use Real-Life Examples**\n\nLet me think of real-life scenarios. Suppose I owe $10 versus owing $20.\n\n- **Owe $10:** Less debt\n- **Owe $20:** More debt\n\n**Thought Process:** Owing more is worse, so \\(-20\\) represents a larger debt than \\(-10\\).\n\n- **Reflection:** This analogy helps confirm that \\(-10\\) is less negative, hence greater.\n\n- **Conclusion from Strategy 3:** **Again, \\(-10\\) is greater than \\(-20\\).**\n\n### **Strategy 4: Perform Simple Arithmetic Checks**\n\nLet's do a basic subtraction to see the difference.\n\n- **Calculate:**  \n  \\[\n  -10 - (-20) = -10 + 20 = 10\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:** The result is positive, which means \\(-10\\) is greater than \\(-20\\).\n\n- **Reflection:** A positive result here confirms that subtracting \\(-20\\) from \\(-10\\) yields a positive number, indicating that \\(-10\\) is larger.\n\n- **Conclusion from Strategy 4:** **Confirms that \\(-10\\) is greater than \\(-20\\).**\n\n---\n\n## **Checking the Approaches**\n\nAfter exploring all these strategies, they consistently point to the same answer. But let me do a quick check to ensure everything aligns.\n\n- **Number Line Visualization:** \u2705\n- **Absolute Values Comparison:** \u2705\n- **Real-Life Example:** \u2705\n- **Arithmetic Check:** \u2705\n\n**Final Reflection:** All methods agree that \\(-10\\) is greater than \\(-20\\). It seems clear now.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n**Solution:** **No, \\(-10\\) is not less than \\(-20\\).** In fact, \\(-10\\) is greater than \\(-20\\).  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nLooking back, starting with the number line was helpful, but real-life examples and arithmetic checks really solidified my understanding. It's always good to approach a problem from multiple angles to ensure the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies and reflecting at each step, I confidently arrived at the conclusion that \\(-10\\) is **not** less than \\(-20\\)\u2014in fact, it's greater.",
