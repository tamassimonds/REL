  "problem": "Is -1 a prime number?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this question step by step, just like I would if I were working through it on paper. I'll dive into my thought process, explore different strategies, and check my work along the way to ensure the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Impressions:**  \nOkay, the question is asking whether \\(-1\\) is a prime number. At first glance, I know prime numbers are usually positive integers, but I'm not entirely sure about negative numbers. I remember dealing with primes mostly in the context of positive numbers. Hmm... this looks similar to something I've done before, but involving negative numbers is a bit fuzzy.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**  \n- Do prime numbers include negative integers?\n- What exactly defines a prime number?\n- Should I look into the mathematical definition to be certain?\n\nI think I need to revisit the basic definition of prime numbers to proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **<I>Step 1: Exploring Different Strategies</I>**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Recall the Definition of a Prime Number**\n\n**<I>Thought Process:</I>**  \nLet me start by recalling what a prime number is. I remember that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Wait... greater than 1? That immediately raises a flag because \\(-1\\) is less than 1.\n\n**<I>Reflection:</I>**  \n- If prime numbers are defined as greater than 1, then negative numbers, including \\(-1\\), might not even qualify.\n- But maybe there's more to it. Could there be a different definition that includes negatives?\n\n**<I>Check:</I>**  \nThis seems too straightforward. Maybe I should double-check the definition to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\n**<I>Outcome:</I>**  \nYup, according to the standard definition, prime numbers are indeed greater than 1. So, by this definition alone, \\(-1\\) cannot be a prime number.\n\n**<I>Conclusion:</I>**  \nSince prime numbers are defined as greater than 1, \\(-1\\) does not meet this criterion and is **not** a prime number.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Attempting to Apply the Prime Test to \\(-1\\)**\n\n**<I>Thought Process:</I>**  \nMaybe I can apply the prime test to \\(-1\\) to see if it behaves like a prime number.\n\n**<I>Calculations:</I>**  \n- A prime number should only have two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n- So, let's see what the divisors of \\(-1\\) are.\n\n**<I>Reflection:</I>**  \n- The divisors of \\(-1\\) are \\(-1\\) and 1.\n- Hold on... prime numbers are supposed to have exactly two **positive** divisors. Here, I have one negative and one positive divisor.\n\n**<I>Check:</I>**  \nDoes this align with the definition? The standard prime number definition emphasizes **positive** divisors.\n\n**<I>Outcome:</I>**  \nSince \\(-1\\) doesn't have two distinct positive divisors, it fails the prime test.\n\n**<I>Conclusion:</I>**  \n\\(-1\\) does not have two distinct positive divisors, so it is **not** a prime number.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Considering Negative Primes**\n\n**<I>Thought Process:</I>**  \nMaybe there\u2019s a concept of negative prime numbers that I\u2019m not familiar with.\n\n**<I>Research Check:</I>**  \n- Is there an extended definition of primes that includes negative numbers?\n- Could \\(-1\\) be considered prime under a different mathematical framework?\n\n**<I>Outcome:</I>**  \nI recall that in certain mathematical structures, like ring theory, negative numbers can have properties similar to primes, but \\(-1\\) is typically considered a unit, not a prime.\n\n**<I>Reflection:</I>**  \n- Units are numbers that have a multiplicative inverse, and \\(-1\\) has an inverse (\\(-1 \\times -1 = 1\\)). \n- In most number systems, units are excluded from being primes.\n\n**<I>Conclusion:</I>**  \nIn advanced mathematics, \\(-1\\) is considered a **unit**, not a prime. Therefore, \\(-1\\) is **not** a prime number.\n\n---\n\n### **<I>Step 2: Checking Consistency</I>**\n\n**<I>Final Check:</I>**  \nAll strategies agree that \\(-1\\) does not meet the criteria for being a prime number. The standard definition excludes it because it's less than 1, and even when attempting to apply the prime test, it fails due to the nature of its divisors.\n\n**<I>Random Insight:</I>**  \nActually, thinking about it, all negative numbers would fail the prime test because prime numbers are inherently positive. This reinforces that \\(-1\\) cannot be prime.\n\n**<I>Final Conclusion:</I>**  \nAfter exploring multiple strategies and confirming through definitions, \\(-1\\) is **not** a prime number.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy reflecting on the definition of prime numbers and attempting to apply prime tests to \\(-1\\), it becomes clear that \\(-1\\) does not satisfy the conditions required to be a prime. Additionally, considering advanced mathematical concepts, \\(-1\\) is identified as a unit rather than a prime. Therefore, the final conclusion is that **\\(-1\\) is not a prime number**.\n\n---\n\nThere we go! Taking the time to explore different strategies, checking each step, and ensuring consistency helped arrive at a clear and confident answer.",
