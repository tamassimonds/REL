  "problem": "If a plane crashes on the border of two countries, where do they bury the survivors?",
  "solution": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into refining this solution to make it more coherent and complete. I'll maintain the original thought process while ensuring clarity and brevity. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nWhen I first read the question, \"If a plane crashes on the border of two countries, where do they bury the survivors?\" it strikes me as familiar\u2014perhaps a classic riddle. It seems straightforward, but there's something that feels off.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**  \n- **Legal Jurisdiction:** Which country has the right to handle the aftermath?\n- **Location of Crash:** Does the exact spot on the border matter?\n- **Survivors' Nationality:** Could it depend on where the survivors are from?\n\n**But Wait...**  \nHold on\u2014**burying survivors**? That doesn\u2019t make sense because survivors are alive. This prompts me to reconsider my initial thoughts.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore jumping to conclusions, I need to ensure I fully understand what's being asked. At first glance, it seems like a logistical question about where to bury survivors, but the mention of \"survivors\" is puzzling.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute\u2014**survivors** are alive! You don't bury people who survived a crash. This makes me think the question might be a trick or a test of attention to detail.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**  \n- **Literal Interpretation:** Treat it as a straightforward logistics question.\n- **Critical Thinking:** Identify if there's a hidden element or trick.\n- **Common Sense Check:** Assess if the question makes logical sense.\n\nSince the literal interpretation raises a red flag, let\u2019s explore further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Literal Interpretation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, let\u2019s assume it\u2019s a genuine question about handling survivors after a crash. Where would they be buried?\n\n**Considerations:**  \n- **Legal Jurisdiction:** Which country has the right to handle the aftermath?\n- **Survivors' Nationality:** Does the nationality of survivors play a role?\n- **International Law:** Are there international agreements for such situations?\n\n**Initial Calculation:**  \nBut hold on\u2014none of these factors matter because **survivors aren't buried**. This approach doesn't make sense.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nThis contradiction suggests that the question is flawed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Critical Thinking Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince the literal interpretation doesn't work, maybe the question is meant to test attentiveness or critical thinking.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIs this a trick question? It seems like it because asking where to bury survivors doesn't logically follow. Perhaps the real test is to see if I notice that inconsistency.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nLet me think about it as a riddle. The key here might be to point out that the premise of the question is incorrect.\n\n**Checking Work:**  \nDoes this approach make sense? Yes, because recognizing the flaw in the question is essential to providing the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Common Sense Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's apply common sense. Survivors are people who lived through the crash, so the question of where to bury them is irrelevant.\n\n**Quick Calculation:**  \nNo need for complex reasoning here\u2014it's straightforward that survivors wouldn't be buried.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this align with reality? Absolutely. It confirms that the question doesn't make logical sense as written.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Reflection and Validation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLooking back at my initial thoughts, I see that my first instinct was correct\u2014this is likely a trick question. My brainstorming led me to consider different angles, but ultimately, recognizing the flaw in the question was key.\n\n**Check and Validation:**  \nIs my approach correct? Yes. By exploring various strategies and reflecting on each step, I've confirmed that the question's premise is flawed.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nIs there any other way to interpret the question that makes sense? No, all interpretations lead back to the inconsistency of burying survivors.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nSurvivors are not buried because they are alive. Therefore, the question is flawed as it doesn't apply to survivors.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Considered factors like legal jurisdiction and nationality but quickly realized they didn't apply since survivors aren't buried.\n- **Literal Interpretation:** Attempted to see it as a straightforward question but found it illogical.\n- **Critical Thinking:** Identified the question as a trick or riddle designed to test attentiveness.\n- **Common Sense Check:** Applied basic logic to confirm that the premise is flawed.\n- **Reflection and Validation:** Reviewed the thought process to ensure correctness and consistency.\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and validating the approach, I arrived at the correct answer. Recognizing the flaw in the question was essential to solving it effectively.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis exercise highlights the importance of **careful reading** and **critical thinking**. Even seemingly straightforward questions can contain hidden elements that test our attention to detail. Always take a moment to fully understand the question before jumping to conclusions, and be open to changing your approach if something doesn't add up.\n\n---\n\n**Complete Solution Recap:**  \n- **Initial Confusion:** The question seemed logistical but mentioned burying survivors, which doesn't make sense.\n- **Literal Approach Failed:** Realized that survivors wouldn't be buried, indicating a flaw in the question.\n- **Critical Thinking Led to Clarity:** Identified it as a trick question testing attentiveness.\n- **Final Answer:** Survivors are not buried because they are alive; thus, the question is inherently flawed.\n\nBy following a structured thought process and being open to reevaluating initial assumptions, the true nature of the question was revealed, leading to the correct answer.",
