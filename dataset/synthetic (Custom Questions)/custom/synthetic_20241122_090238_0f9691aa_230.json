  "problem": "Is the square root of 2 rational?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's consolidate the brain dump into a polished, complete solution while preserving the original problem-solving journey. I'll maintain the natural thought process but refine it for clarity and coherence.\n\n---\n\n### **Determining the Rationality of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)**\n\n---\n\n**<ANSWER>  \nBy assuming that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational and arriving at a contradiction, we've proven that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is indeed **irrational**.  \n</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen faced with determining whether \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational, my initial reaction is to recall concepts from math class about rational and irrational numbers. I remember that rational numbers can be expressed as fractions \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers with \\(b \\neq 0\\). Conversely, irrational numbers cannot be represented this way. Given that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is often cited as an example of an irrational number, I need to explore whether it fits the definition of rationality.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Attempt to Express \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) as a Fraction**\n\nMy first idea is to try expressing \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) as a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) and see if such integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exist. However, I quickly realize that with infinitely many fractions, randomly searching isn't practical. This approach feels inefficient.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis method might not yield a definitive answer, so I need a more systematic approach. I recall that **proof by contradiction** is a powerful tool for such problems.\n\n**Strategy 2: Proof by Contradiction**\n\nNow, I decide to assume that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational and see if this leads to any contradictions. If it does, then \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) must be irrational.\n\n### **Implementing Strategy 2: Proof by Contradiction**\n\n**Step 1: Assume \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is Rational**\n\nI start by assuming that \\(\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b}\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers with no common factors (i.e., the fraction is in its simplest form), and \\(b \\neq 0\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) can be expressed this way, then both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must satisfy certain conditions. Let's see where this leads.\n\n**Step 2: Square Both Sides of the Equation**\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^2 \\implies 2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}\n\\]\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n\\[\n2b^2 = a^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis equation indicates that \\(a^2\\) is twice \\(b^2\\). I need to consider what this implies about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Equation**\n\nSince \\(a^2\\) is even (being \\(2 \\times b^2\\)), \\(a\\) must also be even. I recall that the square of an odd number is always odd, so \\(a\\) being even is necessary here.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet\u2019s express \\(a\\) as \\(a = 2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs this correct? Yes, because an even number is divisible by 2.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute Back into the Original Equation**\n\nSubstituting \\(a = 2k\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n2b^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 \\implies b^2 = 2k^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, \\(b^2\\) is also even, which implies that \\(b\\) must be even as well.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBut wait, if both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are even, this contradicts our initial assumption that \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) is in its simplest form (i.e., \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have no common factors).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis contradiction indicates that our initial assumption that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational must be false. Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational.\n\n### **Reflecting on the Approach**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe proof by contradiction successfully led us to a logical inconsistency, confirming that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers in simplest form.\n\n**Alternative Strategies:**\n\n- **Decimal Representation:** Noting that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)'s decimal expansion is non-terminating and non-repeating also suggests irrationality, but this is less rigorous.\n  \n- **Continued Fractions:** Another advanced method involves expressing \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) as an infinite continued fraction, characteristic of irrational numbers.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nProof by contradiction provides a clear and rigorous solution, making it the preferred strategy here.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**<ANSWER>  \nBy assuming that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational and arriving at a contradiction, we've proven that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is indeed **irrational**.  \n</ANSWER>**\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Assumption Validity:** The assumption that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational led to both numerator and denominator being even, violating the condition of the fraction being in simplest form.\n\n- **Logical Consistency:** Each step logically followed from the previous one, reinforcing the correctness of the proof.\n\n- **Thoughts After Solving:** Initially unsure of the best approach, considering direct fraction representation seemed impractical. Shifting to proof by contradiction provided a clear path to the solution. Being flexible and open to changing strategies ensured the problem was correctly solved.\n\n---\n\nI hope this refined walkthrough effectively captures the natural thought process while delivering a coherent and complete solution to proving the irrationality of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).",
