  "solution": "---\n\n### **Complete Solution: Counting the Digit 3 Between 1 and 100**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like working through it naturally. The goal is to determine how many times the digit **3** appears between **1 and 100**. Here's how I'd approach it, exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and ensuring the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n#### **Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the question, a few strategies come to mind:\n\n1. **Manual Counting:** List all the numbers and tally up the **3s**.\n2. **Digit Position Analysis:** Examine the tens and units places separately.\n3. **Pattern Recognition:** Look for recurring patterns within the numbers.\n4. **Mathematical Formula:** Perhaps there's a formula to compute this directly.\n\n**Hmm...** manual counting seems straightforward but might get tedious. I think exploring different strategies is essential to ensure accuracy. Let's brainstorm more before committing to one approach.\n\n#### **Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n- **Manual Listing:** Reliable but time-consuming. There's a risk of human error.\n- **Digit Position Analysis:** Systematic and efficient. It breaks down the problem into manageable parts.\n- **Pattern Recognition:** Could save time if a clear pattern emerges.\n- **Mathematical Formula:** Not certain if one exists off the top of my head, but it might be worth considering.\n\n**Reflection:** I'm leaning toward **Digit Position Analysis** because it seems the most efficient and less prone to error than manual counting. But before settling, let's think through how this would work.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Digit Positions**\n\nOkay, so numbers between **1 and 100** have up to two digits:\n\n- **Tens Place**\n- **Units Place**\n\nThe digit **3** can appear in either or both positions. This reminds me of problems where counting occurrences based on position is key, so analyzing each position separately makes sense.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Units Place:** How often does **3** appear across the range?\n- **Tens Place:** How often does **3** appear in the tens place?\n\n**Wait,** there's also the number **100**, but it doesn't have a **3**, so it shouldn't affect our count. I need to ensure I include all numbers up to **100** to be thorough.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Counting 3s in the Units Place**\n\nLet's start with the **units place**. I can list out numbers ending in **3**:\n\n- **3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93**\n\nCounting these up...that's **10** numbers.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- That seems right because there are **10** possible digits (**0-9**), and **3** is one of them. So, **3** should appear once every ten numbers.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- If there are **100** numbers, and **3** appears once every ten, then **10** occurrences make sense.\n\n**But wait...** does that include all scenarios? Each decade should have a **3** in the units place, so it checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Counting 3s in the Tens Place**\n\nNow, let's move to the **tens place**. I need to list numbers where **3** is in the tens position:\n\n- **30-39:** That's **10** numbers right there.\n\nSo, that's another **10** occurrences.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Only the **30s** have a **3** in the tens place within our range. Other decades (**0-29, 40-99**) don\u2019t have a **3** in the tens place.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Yep, only one full decade has **3** in the tens place, so **10** occurrences are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Overlaps**\n\n**Hmm...wait a second.** Numbers like **33** have **3** in both the tens and units places. So, if I simply add up the **10** from the units place and **10** from the tens place, I'm double-counting **33**.\n\nThis reminds me of problems involving overlaps where you need to subtract the double-counted instances.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Total 3s = (Units Place 3s) + (Tens Place 3s) - (Numbers with 3 in Both Places)**\n\nSo, I need to find how many numbers have **3** in both positions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying Overlaps**\n\nLooking at our range, the only number with **3** in both the tens and units places is **33**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- There's only one such number between **1 and 100**.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Yes, **33** is the only number where both digits are **3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Total**\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n- **Units Place 3s:** 10\n- **Tens Place 3s:** 10\n- **Overlap (Both Places):** 1\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total 3s} = 10 + 10 - 1 = 19\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Does this make sense? Initially, adding **10 + 10** gives **20**, but since **33** was counted twice, subtracting **1** brings it to **19**.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- That seems right. By accounting for the overlap, the total should be **19**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying the Approach**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's double-check to ensure no mistakes.\n\n#### **Alternative Check: Manual Listing**\n\n- **Units Place:** 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93 (**10 numbers**)\n- **Tens Place:** 30-39 (**10 numbers**)\n- **Overlap:** Only **33**\n\nTotal from manual listing also confirms **19**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Both the systematic approach and manual listing agree. This consistency reassures me that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- Thinking back, the digit **3** appears once per decade in the units place and fully populates one decade in the tens place, with only one overlap. All parts align, so the solution holds up.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER> **19** times </ANSWER>\n\nThe digit **3** appears **19** times between **1 and 100** when considering both the units and tens places and accounting for overlaps.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying through multiple methods, I've ensured the accuracy of the solution. Initially considering manual counting helped as a backup to validate the systematic approach. Accounting for overlaps was crucial in avoiding overcounting, which is a common pitfall in such problems.\n\nThis step-by-step approach not only provides the correct answer but also enhances confidence in the solution's validity.\n\n---\n\n### **Miscellaneous Thoughts and Realizations**\n\n- **Initial Hesitation:** At first, I thought manual counting might be necessary, but realizing the potential for errors led me to prefer a more analytical method.\n- **Overlap Insight:** Noticing that **33** would be double-counted was a key moment in ensuring accuracy.\n- **Verification Importance:** Double-checking with a manual list helped confirm that the systematic approach was correct, adding an extra layer of validation.\n\nBy embracing these natural thought processes, including moments of doubt and verification, the problem is solved effectively and confidently.\n\n---",
