  "solution": "Absolutely, let's streamline the thought process into a cohesive and human-like solution while maintaining the original answer. I'll guide you through the reflection and brainstorming steps, ensuring clarity and a natural flow.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Possibility of Negative Square Roots**\n\n---\n\n#### **Initial Reflection: What\u2019s the Question Again?**\n\nAlright, the question is whether negative numbers can have square roots. At first glance, this reminds me of my math classes\u2014something about imaginary numbers\u2014but it's a bit fuzzy. Let's think it through step by step to make sure.\n\n#### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Recall Basic Definitions:** Maybe starting with what a square root really is could help.\n2. **Examine Real Numbers:** Hmm, do negative numbers have square roots within the real numbers?\n3. **Consider Imaginary Numbers:** I vaguely remember that imaginary numbers might play a role here.\n4. **Try Examples:** Testing with actual numbers could clarify things.\n\nI think exploring real numbers first and then moving to imaginary numbers makes sense. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Square Roots**\n\n**Idea:** Let's recall what a square root is.\n\n- **Thoughts:** I remember that the square root of a number \\( x \\) is a number \\( y \\) such that \\( y \\times y = x \\). So, squaring a number should bring us back to the original.\n\n**Reflection:** If squaring returns the original number, what happens with negatives?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Square Roots in Real Numbers**\n\n**Strategy:** Check if negative numbers have square roots within the real numbers.\n\n- **Thoughts:** \n  - Real numbers include positives, negatives, and zero.\n  - Let's test:\n    - Square of 2: \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\)\n    - Square of -2: \\( (-2) \\times (-2) = 4 \\)\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a minute, both positive and negative numbers squared give a positive result. That means squaring any real number always results in a non-negative number.\n\n**Conclusion:** Within real numbers, no square root exists for negative numbers because squaring any real number yields a positive outcome.\n\n**Check:** Yup, that aligns. No real number squared gives a negative.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Recognizing the Limitations of Real Numbers**\n\n**Thought Process:** Since real numbers can't provide square roots for negatives, maybe there's another number system that can.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** This reminds me of imaginary numbers. Perhaps they're designed to handle this exact scenario.\n\n**Reflection:** It seems logical to explore beyond real numbers. Let's see what imaginary numbers have to offer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Introducing Imaginary Numbers**\n\n**Strategy:** Investigate the role of imaginary numbers in finding square roots of negative numbers.\n\n- **Thoughts:**\n  - The imaginary unit \\( i \\) is defined as \\( i = \\sqrt{-1} \\).\n  - This implies \\( i \\times i = -1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** So, if \\( i \\) squared equals \\(-1\\), then negative numbers can have square roots involving \\( i \\).\n\n**Check:** Does this match my recollection? Yes, it does.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Applying Imaginary Numbers to Negative Square Roots**\n\n**Idea:** Use the imaginary unit \\( i \\) to find square roots of other negative numbers.\n\n- **Example:** Let's find \\( \\sqrt{-4} \\).\n  - Calculation: \n    \\[\n    \\sqrt{-4} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{-1} = 2 \\times i = 2i \n    \\]\n\n**Reflection:** This works! It indicates that negative numbers do have square roots in the imaginary number system.\n\n**Conclusion:** Negative numbers have square roots, but only within the imaginary numbers.\n\n**Check:** Let's test another example to confirm.\n  - \\( \\sqrt{-9} = \\sqrt{9} \\times \\sqrt{-1} = 3i \\)\n  - Consistency achieved.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying with Real-World Applications**\n\n**Idea:** See if this concept holds in practical scenarios.\n\n- **Example:** In electrical engineering, especially AC circuits, impedance involves imaginary numbers.\n\n**Thoughts:** \n  - Impedance can have an imaginary component due to inductance and capacitance.\n  - Square roots of negative numbers are essential for calculating phase angles and magnitudes.\n\n**Reflection:** This real-world application supports the theory that negative numbers have square roots in the imaginary domain.\n\n**Check:** Yes, it makes sense. Imaginary numbers are crucial in fields like engineering.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Thoughts and Double-Checking**\n\n**Thought Process:** Before finalizing, let's ensure no aspect is overlooked.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** \n  - Are there other number systems where negative numbers have square roots?\n  - Oh, right! Imaginary numbers are part of the complex number system.\n\n**Reflection:** Indeed, imaginary numbers belong to the complex number system, expressed as \\( a + bi \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers.\n\n**Conclusion:** Negative numbers have square roots within the complex number system, involving the imaginary unit \\( i \\).\n\n**Check:** Everything aligns correctly. No contradictions found.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution Recap</ANSWER>**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nNegative numbers *do* have square roots, but only within the complex number system using imaginary numbers. In the real number system, negative numbers do not have square roots.\n\n- **Real Numbers:** No square roots for negative numbers.\n- **Imaginary Numbers:** Square roots exist using the imaginary unit \\( i \\), where \\( i = \\sqrt{-1} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Thought Process:** By starting with real numbers and recognizing their limitations, we naturally transitioned to exploring imaginary numbers. This step-by-step approach clarified that negative numbers have square roots within the complex number system.\n\n- **Learning Point:** Expanding beyond real numbers introduces us to imaginary and complex numbers, essential for addressing negative square roots.\n\n- **Check:** Multiple examples and real-world applications confirmed the correctness of the approach.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed, human-like thinking process helps in thoroughly understanding how negative numbers can have square roots within the complex number system!",
