  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this question. I'll approach it as naturally as possible, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work regularly, and reflecting along the way\u2014just like how I would tackle a problem in real life.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the question is whether it's possible for a negative number to have a square root. Hmm... this reminds me of some concepts from math class, but I'm not entirely sure off the top of my head. I think it's related to **square roots** and **negative numbers**, which brings to mind both real numbers and maybe something about **imaginary numbers**. Let's brainstorm a bit.\n\n- **Brainstorming Ideas:**\n  - Can I recall how square roots work with negative numbers?\n  - Maybe I can draw from real-world examples or mathematical definitions.\n  - Should I consider different number systems like real and complex numbers?\n\nHonestly, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details right now, so I need to explore different angles to see what sticks.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Understanding Square Roots in the Real Number System**\n\nLet me start by recalling how square roots operate within the **real number system**.\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - I remember that the square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.\n  - So, for a positive number like 4, the square root is 2 because \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n  - But what about negative numbers?\n\n- **Testing with a Negative Number:**\n  - Let's take \\(-4\\). Is there a real number that multiplies by itself to give \\(-4\\)?\n  - Trying positive 2: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) (Doesn't work)\n  - Trying negative 2: \\((-2) \\times (-2) = 4\\) (Also doesn't work)\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - Wait a minute. It seems that in the real number system, multiplying any real number by itself always gives a **positive** result.\n  - So, it looks like there\u2019s no real number whose square is negative.\n\n- **Conclusion for Strategy 1:**\n  - **In the real number system, negative numbers do not have square roots.**\n\n#### **Check:**\n\nIs this conclusion correct?\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - Yeah, it makes sense because squaring any real number (positive or negative) yields a positive result.\n\n- **Deeper Reflection:**\n  - But the question asks if it's *possible*, which makes me think there might be more to explore beyond just real numbers.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Introducing Imaginary Numbers**\n\nSince the real number system doesn't accommodate square roots of negative numbers, maybe I need to think about **imaginary numbers**. I vaguely remember something about the imaginary unit \\(i\\).\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - I think \\(i\\) is defined as the square root of \\(-1\\).\n  - So, perhaps using \\(i\\), we can express square roots of negative numbers.\n\n- **Testing with \\(-4\\):**\n  - Can I express \\(\\sqrt{-4}\\) using \\(i\\)?\n  - Let's see: \\(\\sqrt{-4} = \\sqrt{4 \\times (-1)}\\)\n  - This can be split into \\(\\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{-1} = 2 \\times i = 2i\\)\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - Oh! This actually works. By introducing \\(i\\), I can represent the square root of negative numbers.\n\n- **Conclusion for Strategy 2:**\n  - **In the complex number system, negative numbers do have square roots, expressed using the imaginary unit \\(i\\).**\n\n#### **Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - Let\u2019s verify: \\((2i) \\times (2i) = 4i^2 = 4 \\times (-1) = -4\\)\n  - Yup, that checks out!\n\n- **Deeper Reflection:**\n  - So, introducing imaginary numbers allows us to find square roots of negative numbers. This seems like a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Reflection**\n\n- **First Thoughts Revisited:**\n  - Initially, I only considered the real number system, which led me to think that negative numbers don't have square roots. But by exploring further and recalling imaginary numbers, I found that they do exist within the complex number system.\n\n- **Brainstorming Outcome:**\n  - Exploring different number systems was key to arriving at the correct answer.\n\n- **Is the Answer Correct?**\n  - Yes, by considering both real and complex number systems, I've covered all bases.\n\n- **Lessons Learned:**\n  - It's important to think beyond the initial, obvious strategies and consider alternative number systems to fully answer the question.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>**\n\nNegative numbers do not have square roots in the real number system, but they do have square roots in the complex number system using imaginary numbers.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step reflection helps in understanding how to approach and solve the problem naturally, considering different strategies and checking for correctness along the way.",
