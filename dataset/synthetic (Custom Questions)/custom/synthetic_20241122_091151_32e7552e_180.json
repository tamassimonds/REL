However, I realized it's essential to focus on the digit 7 in both the units and tens places\u2014not just the number 7 itself. To ensure accuracy, I considered various strategies before settling on the most efficient approach.\n\n---\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Manual Counting:**  \n   My initial thought was to list all numbers from 1 to 100 and count each occurrence of 7. However, I quickly recognized that this method would be time-consuming and prone to errors, such as double-counting or missing some instances.\n\n   > **Reflection:** This isn't the best approach; I need something more systematic.\n\n2. **Breaking into Tens and Units:**  \n   Next, I thought of examining the units and tens places separately. This strategy seemed more organized and likely to capture all occurrences of 7 without confusion.\n\n   > **Decision:** Let's proceed with this strategy as it promises clarity and efficiency.\n\n3. **Using a Pattern or Formula:**  \n   I also considered identifying a repeating pattern or formula to calculate the occurrences. While potentially faster, I wasn't immediately sure of the pattern, so it might require more time to figure out.\n\n   > **Conclusion:** Stick with breaking into tens and units for now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Counting 7s in the Units Place**\n\nTo start, I focused on numbers where 7 appears in the **units place**:\n\n- The numbers are: **7, 17, 27, 37, 47, 57, 67, 77, 87, 97**\n\n  > **Count:** 10 occurrences\n\n  > **Quick Check:** There are 10 decades between 1 and 100, so having one 7 in the units place per decade makes sense.\n\n  > **Reflection:** This part checks out with no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Counting 7s in the Tens Place**\n\nNext, I looked at numbers where 7 appears in the **tens place**:\n\n- The numbers are: **70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79**\n\n  > **Count:** 10 occurrences\n\n  > **Wait a Minute:** I noticed that **77** has a 7 in both the tens and units places, meaning I've double-counted this number.\n\n  > **Reflection:** I need to adjust for this double-counting to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Adjusting for Double-Counting**\n\nSince **77** contains two 7s (one in the tens place and one in the units place), it's essential to account for this extra occurrence:\n\n- **Original Count:**  \n  - Units Place: 10  \n  - Tens Place: 10  \n\n- **Double-Counting Adjustment:**  \n  - **77** was counted twice\u2014once for the tens and once for the units. Therefore, I need to add **1** more to account for the second 7 in 77.\n\n  > **Correction:** Total = 10 (units) + 10 (tens) + 1 (extra 7 in 77) = **21**\n\n  > **Reflection:** This adjustment ensures that all instances of the digit 7 are accurately counted.\n\n---\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\n- **Units Place 7s:** 10  \n- **Tens Place 7s:** 10  \n- **Extra 7 in 77:** +1  \n\n> **Total:** 10 + 10 + 1 = **21**\n\n  > **Quick Check:** With 100 numbers in total, having 21 instances of the digit 7 seems reasonable and aligns with expectations.\n\n  > **Reflection:** The approach is correct, and the calculations are consistent with the problem requirements.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\n**Solution:** The digit 7 appears **21 times** between 1 and 100.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Learning Point:** \n  - Breaking the problem into smaller parts (examining units and tens separately) made the task manageable and ensured accuracy.\n\n- **Reflection:** \n  - Although I initially considered manual counting, recognizing its inefficiency led me to adopt a more structured approach. Adjusting for double-counting was crucial to obtaining the correct answer.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** \n  - Exploring different methods helped confirm that breaking the problem into parts was the most effective strategy, ensuring all occurrences of the digit 7 were captured without error.\n\n> **Overall:** Taking the time to brainstorm, reflect, and adjust strategies ensured the accuracy of the final answer, demonstrating the importance of a thoughtful problem-solving approach.\n\n---\n\nAnd there you have it! A complete, coherent solution that walks through the entire thought process, ensuring clarity and correctness at each step.",
