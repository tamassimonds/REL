Here\u2019s how we can do it:\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring: What's Lighter\u2014Air or Helium?**\n\nWhen faced with the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s lighter, air or helium?\u201d it's natural to have an initial intuition, but let's walk through the thought process to ensure our answer is accurate. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Initial Brainstorming**\n\n**Starting Point:**  \nAt first glance, I recall that helium balloons float, suggesting helium is lighter than air. But is it really that straightforward? Perhaps there's more to consider.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**  \n- Comparing the densities of air and helium.\n- Examining molecular weights.\n- Reflecting on real-life examples, like helium balloons.\n\n**Initial Uncertainty:**  \nWhile I\u2019m fairly confident that helium is lighter, I need to verify my reasoning to be certain.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Concept**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore jumping into calculations, let's grasp why something floats. I remember that buoyancy plays a role\u2014it depends on the density of the fluid (air) and the object (like a helium balloon).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, if helium is less dense than air, it should float. But what about factors like temperature or pressure? Is density the correct property to compare?\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nYes, density (mass per unit volume) is the key factor determining whether one substance will float in another.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Strategy 1:** Calculate the densities of air and helium under standard conditions.\n- **Strategy 2:** Investigate the molecular weights of air components and helium.\n- **Strategy 3:** Consider experiments or real-life scenarios, such as helium balloons.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s start with Strategy 1\u2014calculating densities. If this approach doesn't confirm our initial thought, we'll proceed to molecular weights.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Densities**\n\n**Approach:**  \nUse the formula for density:  \n\\(\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}\\) (mass per unit volume).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **For Helium (\\(He\\)):**  \n  - Molar mass = 4 g/mol  \n  - At standard temperature and pressure (STP: 0\u00b0C and 1 atm), 1 mole occupies 22.4 liters.\n\n\\[\n\\rho_{He} = \\frac{4\\, \\text{g/mol}}{22.4\\, \\text{L/mol}} = 0.178\\, \\text{g/L}\n\\]\n\n- **For Air:**  \n  - Air is primarily composed of nitrogen (\\(N_2\\)) and oxygen (\\(O_2\\)), with an average molar mass \u2248 29 g/mol.\n\n\\[\n\\rho_{\\text{Air}} = \\frac{29\\, \\text{g/mol}}{22.4\\, \\text{L/mol}} = 1.29\\, \\text{g/L}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet me double-check these calculations. Does it make sense that air is approximately 1.29 g/L? Yes, this aligns with what I remember from physics classes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Comparing Densities**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's compare the two densities:\n\n\\[\n\\rho_{He} = 0.178\\, \\text{g/L} \\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad \\rho_{\\text{Air}} = 1.29\\, \\text{g/L}\n\\]\n\n**Observation:**  \nHelium has a significantly lower density than air.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis confirms my initial thought\u2014helium is lighter than air. However, to ensure accuracy, let's verify with an alternative strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Alternative Strategy \u2013 Molecular Weights**\n\n**Approach:**  \nExamine the molecular weights of helium and the main components of air.\n\n- **Helium (\\(He\\)):** 4 g/mol\n- **Air Components:**\n  - Nitrogen (\\(N_2\\)): 28 g/mol\n  - Oxygen (\\(O_2\\)): 32 g/mol\n  - Average molar mass of air \u2248 29 g/mol\n\n**Comparison:**  \nHelium\u2019s molecular weight is significantly lower than that of air\u2019s components.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince helium molecules are lighter, they occupy the same volume with less mass, making helium less dense.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this align with our previous density calculation? Yes, it does.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Real-Life Example**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nConsider helium balloons. They float because the helium inside is less dense than the surrounding air.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis real-life observation supports our calculations. If helium were heavier, balloons wouldn\u2019t float.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs there any scenario where helium wouldn't be lighter? Only under extreme conditions (like very high pressure), but generally, helium remains lighter.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Verification**\n\n**Approach:**  \nEnsure all factors are considered:\n\n- **Temperature and Pressure:**  \n  Our calculations assume standard conditions. Under different conditions, densities can change, but helium will generally remain lighter.\n\n- **Impurities:**  \n  Pure helium is lighter, but if mixed with heavier gases, its density could increase. However, commercially available helium is usually pure enough for balloons to float.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nConsidering these factors, the conclusion remains valid.\n\n**Check:**  \nEverything aligns\u2014calculations, molecular weights, and real-life examples all point to helium being lighter than air.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>Solution:</ANSWER>  \n**Helium is lighter than air.**\n\n- **Density of Helium:** 0.178 g/L  \n- **Density of Air:** 1.29 g/L  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHelium has a lower density than air, making it lighter and allowing helium-filled balloons to float.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy systematically examining densities, molecular weights, and real-life examples, we've thoroughly verified that helium is indeed lighter than air. This step-by-step approach ensures that our initial intuition is backed by concrete evidence, reinforcing the accuracy of our final answer.\n\n---\n\nI hope this enhanced solution provides a clear and comprehensive understanding while maintaining the essence of the original thought process.",
