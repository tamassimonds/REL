  "problem": "Is the square root of 2 rational?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, checking each step as I go, and adjusting my approach if something doesn't seem right. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the question is asking whether the square root of 2 (\u221a2) is rational.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  Hmm, I remember learning about rational and irrational numbers. Rational numbers can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, like \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) where \\( b \\neq 0 \\). So, I need to figure out if \u221a2 can be written that way.\n\n- **Brainstorming:**  \n  Maybe I can try to express \u221a2 as a fraction? Or perhaps there's a proof I learned before that can help.\n\n---\n\n## **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n### **1. Attempting to Express \u221a2 as a Fraction**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Let\u2019s start by assuming \u221a2 is rational. If it is, there should exist integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) (with \\( b \\neq 0 \\)) such that \\( \\frac{a}{b} = \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n- **Writing it Out:**  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b} \\implies 2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2} \\implies a^2 = 2b^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  Wait, this equation \\( a^2 = 2b^2 \\) looks familiar. It reminds me of the proof by contradiction for irrational numbers.\n\n### **2. Using Proof by Contradiction**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Let me dive deeper into this. If assuming \u221a2 is rational leads to a contradiction, then \u221a2 must be irrational.\n\n- **Steps:**  \n  - Assume \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers with no common factors (i.e., the fraction \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) is in its simplest form).\n  - From \\( a^2 = 2b^2 \\), it follows that \\( a^2 \\) is even (since it's 2 times something).\n\n- **Checking:**  \n  - **Is \\( a^2 \\) being even significant?**  \n    Yes, because if \\( a^2 \\) is even, then \\( a \\) must also be even (only even numbers squared give even results).\n\n- **Continue:**  \n  - Let\u2019s say \\( a = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n  - Substituting back:  \n    \\[\n    (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2b^2 \\implies b^2 = 2k^2\n    \\]\n    \n- **Reflection:**  \n  So, \\( b^2 \\) is also even, meaning \\( b \\) must be even. But wait, if both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are even, they have a common factor of 2, which contradicts our assumption that \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) is in its simplest form.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  This contradiction implies that our initial assumption is wrong. Therefore, \u221a2 cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers\u2014meaning \u221a2 is irrational.\n\n---\n\n## **Checking the Approach**\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Does the contradiction make sense? Yes, because assuming \u221a2 is rational led us to conclude that both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are even, which violates the condition of the fraction being in its simplest form.\n\n- **Deep Reflection:**  \n  Is there any other way to interpret this? No, the logic seems solid. The contradiction directly stems from the initial assumption, reinforcing that \u221a2 is irrational.\n\n---\n\n## **Trying Another Method (Just to Be Sure)**\n\n### **Decimal Approximation**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Maybe I can approximate \u221a2 as a decimal to see if it repeats or terminates (a property of rational numbers).\n\n- **Calculating:**  \n  - \u221a2 \u2248 1.41421356...\n  - **Observation:**  \n    The decimal does not terminate or repeat, which is a characteristic of irrational numbers.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This supports the previous proof by contradiction. However, decimal approximation isn't a rigorous proof, but it aligns with our conclusion.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n- **Summarizing:**  \n  Both the proof by contradiction and the decimal approximation indicate that \u221a2 cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers.\n\n- **Final Thought:**  \n  Yup, everything checks out. The initial assumption led to a contradiction, and the decimal form supports the irrationality of \u221a2.\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\u221a2 is irrational. Through assuming it can be expressed as a fraction and arriving at a contradiction, we conclude that \u221a2 cannot be represented as a ratio of two integers.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n## **Wrapping Up**\n\n- **Reflection on the Process:**  \n  - Starting with an assumption helped identify the contradiction.\n  - Exploring multiple strategies (proof by contradiction and decimal approximation) reinforced the conclusion.\n  - Constantly checking each step ensured the correctness of the approach.\n\n- **Final Insight:**  \n  Approaching the problem step-by-step, being open to changing strategies, and verifying each part of the process led to a clear and correct conclusion.\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\u221a2 is irrational. Through assuming it can be expressed as a fraction and arriving at a contradiction, we conclude that \u221a2 cannot be represented as a ratio of two integers.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nThat's it! By carefully exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the correctness of the approach, we've confidently concluded that \u221a2 is irrational.",
