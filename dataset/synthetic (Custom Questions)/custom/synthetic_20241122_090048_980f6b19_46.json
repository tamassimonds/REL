  "problem": "What's larger, the set of integers or the set of even numbers?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this question: **Are the set of integers (\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)) and the set of even numbers the same size?** At first glance, it seems straightforward\u2014integers include all numbers, while evens are just a subset. **Intuitively**, I\u2019d think the set of all integers is larger because it includes both odd and even numbers. But I remember learning about different types of infinity in math... maybe there's more to it.\n\n---\n\n## **Brainstorming: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Simple Counting:**\n   - **Idea:** List out both sets and see which has more elements.\n   - **Initial Thoughts:** This seems inefficient because both sets are infinite.\n   - **Reflection:** Yeah, listing doesn't really help with infinite sets.\n\n2. **Subset Comparison:**\n   - **Idea:** Since even numbers are a subset of integers, maybe integers are larger.\n   - **Initial Thoughts:** Makes sense\u2014like how a pie is larger than a slice.\n   - **Reflection:** But wait, I remember something about infinite sets where subsets can be the same size... hmm.\n\n3. **Mapping/One-to-One Correspondence:**\n   - **Idea:** Create a mapping between the two sets to compare their sizes.\n   - **Initial Thoughts:** This reminds me of functions; if each integer maps to an even number, maybe they're the same size.\n   - **Reflection:** This could work. **Let\u2019s explore it further.**\n\nSince the first two strategies don\u2019t quite address the nature of infinite sets, I\u2019ll proceed with the **Mapping/One-to-One Correspondence** approach.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Defining the Sets**\n\n- **Set of Integers (\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)):** \\(\\{\u2026, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026\\}\\)\n- **Set of Even Numbers (\\(\\mathbb{E}\\)):** \\(\\{\u2026, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, \u2026\\}\\)\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nI need to establish whether these two infinite sets are the same size. If I can pair each integer with a unique even number (and vice versa), then their sizes are equal.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Creating a One-to-One Correspondence**\n\n### **Idea:**\n\nCreate a function that maps each integer to a unique even number.\n\n### **Defining the Function:**\n\nLet\u2019s define a function \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{E} \\) such that:\n\n\\[ f(n) = 2n \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is an integer.\n\n### **Check:**\n\n- **For \\( n = 0 \\):** \\( f(0) = 2 \\times 0 = 0 \\)\n- **For \\( n = 1 \\):** \\( f(1) = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\)\n- **For \\( n = -1 \\):** \\( f(-1) = 2 \\times (-1) = -2 \\)\n- **And so on\u2026**\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nThis function seems to work! Each integer maps to a unique even number. But let\u2019s think\u2014does every even number have a corresponding integer?\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Ensuring the Mapping is Bijective**\n\n### **Bijective (One-to-One and Onto):**\n\n- **One-to-One:** No two different integers map to the same even number.\n- **Onto:** Every even number has a corresponding integer.\n\n### **Checking One-to-One:**\n\nSuppose \\( f(n_1) = f(n_2) \\).\n\n\\[ 2n_1 = 2n_2 \\Rightarrow n_1 = n_2 \\]\n\n*No two different integers map to the same even number.*\n\n### **Checking Onto:**\n\nFor every even number \\( m \\), there exists an integer \\( n \\) such that:\n\n\\[ m = 2n \\]\n\n*Every even number is the image of some integer.*\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nThe function \\( f(n) = 2n \\) is both one-to-one and onto. This means the mapping is bijective. So, the set of integers and the set of even numbers have the same **cardinality** (size).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Reconsidering Initial Intuition**\n\n### **Initial Intuition:**\n\nI originally thought the set of integers would be larger since it includes both odd and even numbers.\n\n### **Current Understanding:**\n\nHowever, through the mapping, I see that both sets are infinitely large in the same way. This challenges the intuitive idea that adding more elements (like odds) makes the set larger in an infinite context.\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nInfinite sets can behave counterintuitively. Even though evens are a subset of integers, both sets have the same cardinality because they can be perfectly paired.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Verifying with a Different Approach**\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Pairing Elements**\n\nLet\u2019s try another method to ensure our conclusion is correct.\n\n### **Pairing Each Integer with an Even Number:**\n\n- **0 \u2194 0**\n- **1 \u2194 2**\n- **-1 \u2194 -2**\n- **2 \u2194 4**\n- **-2 \u2194 -4**\n- **And so on\u2026**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nBy listing pairs, I see that every integer corresponds to a unique even number, and vice versa. There are no leftovers in either set.\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nThis reinforces the mapping strategy. The pairing confirms that both sets are the same size.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Considering Potential Objections**\n\n### **Objection: Infinite Subsets Should Be Smaller**\n\nSomeone might argue that since the set of even numbers is a subset of integers, it should be smaller.\n\n### **Response:**\n\nIn finite sets, subsets are always smaller or equal in size. However, infinite sets don\u2019t always follow this rule. **Cantor\u2019s theory of cardinality** shows that infinite sets can have the same size as some of their subsets.\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nUnderstanding that infinite sets behave differently is crucial. Our mapping confirms that the sizes are equal despite one being a subset.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 7: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n### **Final Check: Does the Mapping Hold for All Integers?**\n\nFor any integer \\( n \\), \\( f(n) = 2n \\) produces an even number. There are no gaps or overlaps.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**<ANSWER> Therefore, they are the same size in terms of infinity. </ANSWER>**",
