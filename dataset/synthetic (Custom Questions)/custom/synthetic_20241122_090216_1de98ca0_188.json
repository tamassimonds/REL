  "problem": "Is the square root of 2 rational?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this question step-by-step, capturing my natural thought process, including brainstorming, reflecting, and checking along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see the question, *\"Is the square root of 2 rational?\"* my initial reaction is to recall that I've encountered this problem before. I vaguely remember that the square root of 2 is irrational, but I'm not entirely sure why. I know that proving it involves some kind of mathematical proof, but the specifics are a bit hazy right now.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Proof by Contradiction?** I remember using that method for similar problems.\n- **Express \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) as a Fraction?** Maybe trying to write it as a ratio could help.\n- **Prime Factors?** Something about prime factors rings a bell.\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely certain which path to take, so I\u2019ll start exploring different strategies to see what fits.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Proof by Contradiction**\n\nThis method pops into my mind first. I recall that proof by contradiction involves assuming the opposite of what I'm trying to prove and then finding a contradiction.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Assume \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is Rational:** Meaning it can be expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers with no common factors (i.e., the fraction is in its simplest form).\n- **Does That Make Sense?** If I can show that such a fraction leads to a contradiction, then \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) must be irrational.\n\n**Let\u2019s Try It:**\n\n1. **Assume \\(\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b}\\):**  \n   - Here, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are co-prime integers (\\(b \\neq 0\\)).\n   - **Reflection:** Okay, starting off straightforward. No issues so far.\n\n2. **Square Both Sides to Eliminate the Square Root:**  \n   \\[\n   2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}\n   \\]\n   - **Thought:** This seems logical to get rid of the square root. Let's see where it leads.\n\n3. **Multiply Both Sides by \\(b^2\\) to Clear the Denominator:**  \n   \\[\n   2b^2 = a^2\n   \\]\n   - **Check:** Hmm, this equation tells me that \\(a^2\\) is even (since it's 2 times something). Does that mean \\(a\\) is even? I think so because the square of an odd number is always odd.\n\n4. **Conclude That \\(a\\) Must Be Even:**  \n   - If \\(a^2\\) is even, then \\(a\\) must be even.\n   - **Let \\(a = 2k\\) for Some Integer \\(k\\):**\n   - **Reflection:** So far, so good. Substituting \\(a\\) as an even number might lead us somewhere.\n\n5. **Substitute \\(a = 2k\\) Back into the Equation:**  \n   \\[\n   2b^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 2k^2\n   \\]\n   - **Thought:** Now, this equation tells me that \\(b^2\\) is also even, which means \\(b\\) must be even.\n\n6. **Conclude That \\(b\\) Must Be Even:**  \n   - If \\(b^2\\) is even, then \\(b\\) must be even.\n   - **Check:** Wait a minute, if both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are even, that means they have a common factor of 2. But I initially assumed that \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) was in its simplest form with no common factors. This is a contradiction!\n\n**Outcome:**\n- **Contradiction Found:** Assuming \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational leads to both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) being even, which contradicts the assumption that \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) is in its simplest form.\n- **Conclusion:** Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) must be irrational.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, the contradiction confirms that our initial assumption was incorrect.\n- **Is the Proof Complete?** I believe so. The steps logically lead to a contradiction, thereby proving that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Approach**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me think about whether this approach thoroughly addresses the question.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- **Did I Start with the Right Assumption?** Yes, assuming \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational set the stage for finding a contradiction.\n- **Did Each Step Follow Logically?** Each step naturally followed from the previous one, leading to a contradiction.\n- **Is There Any Step That Feels Off?** No, every step seems logical and supports the conclusion.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**  \n- **Does This Align with What I Initially Remembered?** Yes, I vaguely recalled that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational and that proof by contradiction was involved, and this approach confirms it.\n- **Is There Another Method to Double-Check?** While proof by contradiction is a well-known method, I could explore numerical approximations or other proofs, but for now, this seems sufficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter walking through the proof by contradiction and thoroughly checking each step, I'm confident that the square root of 2 is irrational.\n\n**Final Check:**  \n- **Is the Conclusion Consistent with the Steps Taken?** Yes, the contradiction arising from the assumption confirms the irrationality of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n- **Have All Possibilities Been Considered?** Given that the proof by contradiction directly addresses the question, I believe all necessary aspects have been covered.\n\n---\n\n### **Wrapping Up**\n\nI think this approach effectively answers the question. Starting with brainstorming different strategies, selecting proof by contradiction, and carefully walking through each step helped to arrive at the correct conclusion. Regular reflections and checks ensured the accuracy of the proof and reinforced the understanding that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is indeed irrational.\n\nIf there are any lingering doubts or alternative methods you'd like me to explore, feel free to ask!\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>Solution: The square root of 2 is irrational. By assuming \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational and expressing it as a fraction in its simplest form, we arrive at a contradiction, thereby proving its irrationality.</ANSWER>",
