  "problem": "Is it possible for a negative number to have a square root?",
  "solution": "### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at this question: *Is it possible for a negative number to have a square root?* My immediate reaction is to think about what I learned in math class about square roots. I recall there being some connection to negative numbers and imaginary numbers, but honestly, it's a bit fuzzy right now.\n\nI remember dealing with square roots of positive numbers and how they always had real solutions. But negative numbers... wasn't there something about them not having real square roots? Maybe involving the imaginary unit \\( i \\)? Let me brainstorm a bit to explore different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Explore Real Numbers:** Maybe start by thinking about square roots within the real number system. Does a negative number have a square root there?\n\n2. **Consider Imaginary Numbers:** If real numbers don't work, perhaps I need to consider complex or imaginary numbers.\n\n3. **Reflect on Mathematical Definitions:** Recalling the definition of a square root might help. What does it mean for a number to have a square root?\n\n4. **Use Examples:** Trying out specific negative numbers to see what happens might make it clearer.\n\nI think I'll start with the first strategy\u2014exploring square roots within the real numbers. If that doesn't work, I'll move on to considering imaginary numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Real Numbers**\n\nLet me begin by reflecting on the real number system. I know that the square root of a number \\( x \\) is a number \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = x \\). So, if I'm looking for the square root of a negative number \\( -k \\), it means:\n\n\\[\ny^2 = -k\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is positive. \n\n**Thought Process:** Wait a minute, if I square any real number (\\( y \\)), whether positive or negative, the result is always non-negative:\n\n- If \\( y \\) is positive: \\( y^2 \\geq 0 \\)\n- If \\( y \\) is negative: \\( y^2 \\geq 0 \\)\n- If \\( y \\) is zero: \\( y^2 = 0 \\)\n\n**Reflection:** This seems to suggest that within the real numbers, there's no \\( y \\) that satisfies \\( y^2 = -k \\) because \\( y^2 \\) is always non-negative. \n\n**Quick Check:** So, in the real number system, negative numbers don't have square roots. That aligns with what I vaguely remembered.\n\n**<HUMAN\u2019S THOUGHTS>**\n\nBut wait, the question asks if it's **possible**\u2014which might imply looking beyond just real numbers. Let me think about that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering Complex Numbers**\n\nSince negative numbers don't have square roots in the real number system, maybe I need to consider complex numbers. I remember learning that complex numbers include an imaginary unit \\( i \\), where \\( i^2 = -1 \\).\n\n**Thought Process:** If \\( i^2 = -1 \\), then perhaps I can use \\( i \\) to find the square root of negative numbers.\n\n**Brainstorming:** Let's see how this would work. Suppose I want to find the square root of \\(-k\\) (where \\( k > 0 \\)):\n\n\\[\ny^2 = -k\n\\]\n\nMaybe I can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( i \\):\n\n\\[\ny = \\sqrt{-k} = \\sqrt{k} \\times \\sqrt{-1} = \\sqrt{k} \\times i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This seems to make sense. By introducing \\( i \\), I'm able to express the square root of a negative number.\n\n**Quick Check:** Let me test this with an example to see if it holds.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Testing with an Example**\n\nLet's take a specific negative number, say \\(-4\\), and see if I can find its square root using \\( i \\).\n\n\\[\ny^2 = -4\n\\]\n\nAccording to the approach above:\n\n\\[\ny = \\sqrt{-4} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{-1} = 2 \\times i = 2i\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** So, I've found that \\( y = 2i \\). Let me verify if this is correct by squaring \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n(2i)^2 = 4i^2 = 4 \\times (-1) = -4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** It checks out! Squaring \\( 2i \\) indeed gives me \\(-4\\). This confirms that in the complex number system, negative numbers do have square roots.\n\n**Final Check:** Let me think if there's anything I've missed. Is there any other way to interpret the question? I don't think so. The exploration of real and complex numbers seems comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>Conclusion</ANSWER>**\n\nNegative numbers do not have square roots within the real number system. However, in the complex number system, negative numbers do have square roots involving the imaginary unit \\( i \\). For example, the square root of \\(-4\\) is \\( 2i \\).\n\n---\n\n### **<HUMAN\u2019S THOUGHTS>Final Reflection</HUMAN\u2019S THOUGHTS>**\n\nBy considering both real and complex numbers, I've concluded that while negative numbers don't have square roots in the real number system, they do in the complex number system. This aligns with mathematical definitions and holds true upon testing with an example.\n\n---\n\n### **Natural Flow Recap**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Started by recalling basic concepts of square roots and considering different number systems.\n  \n- **Exploration of Real Numbers:** Realized that negative numbers don't have square roots in the real system because squaring any real number yields a non-negative result.\n  \n- **Introduction of Complex Numbers:** Remembered the role of the imaginary unit \\( i \\) and applied it to find square roots of negative numbers.\n  \n- **Verification with an Example:** Tested the approach with \\(-4\\) and confirmed the validity by squaring the result.\n\n- **Final Reflection and Answer:** Concluded that negative numbers have square roots in the complex number system, providing a clear and correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **<HUMAN\u2019S THOUGHTS>Final Reflection</HUMAN\u2019S THOUGHTS>**\n\nBy thoroughly exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying with examples, I've arrived at a comprehensive understanding of the problem. Negative numbers do not have square roots within the real number system but do have them in the complex number system involving the imaginary unit \\( i \\).\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>Conclusion</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>\nsolution\n\nNegative numbers do not have square roots within the real number system. However, in the complex number system, negative numbers do have square roots involving the imaginary unit \\( i \\). For example, the square root of \\(-4\\) is \\( 2i \\).\n\n</ANSWER>",
