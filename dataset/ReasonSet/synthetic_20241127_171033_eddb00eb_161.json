  "problem": "For how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminate?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem, keeping my original approach but correcting where I went astray. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were working it out on paper, adjusting my strategies as I realize what needs fixing.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question asks for how many integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 120 make the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\) terminate.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving terminating decimals and factors of 10. I think it has something to do with the prime factors of the denominator.\n- **Uncertainty:** But I'm not entirely sure how to apply that here. Maybe I need to explore different strategies to get a better understanding.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Understanding Terminating Decimals:**\n   - **Thought:** I remember that a fraction's decimal representation terminates if its simplified denominator has only the prime factors 2 and 5.\n   - **Reflection:** Yeah, that sounds familiar. But how do I apply it to \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\)?\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 120:**\n   - **Idea:** Perhaps breaking down 120 into its prime factors will help.\n   - **Quick Check:** Let's see... 120 is divisible by 2, then by 3, and by 5.\n\n3. **Simplifying \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\):**\n   - **Thought:** Maybe I need to simplify \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\) for each \\( n \\) and see which denominators have only 2s and 5s.\n   - **Reflection:** But doing this for all \\( n \\) from 1 to 120 seems tedious. There must be a more efficient way.\n\n4. **Using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - **Idea:** Wait, I think using GCD could simplify things. If I can determine when the simplified denominator has only 2s and 5s, I can identify the terminating cases more easily.\n   - **Insight:** This might be the key. Let's explore this further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization of 120**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Thought:** Before proceeding, I need to know the prime factors of 120 to understand which factors need to remain in the denominator for the decimal to terminate.\n- **Quick Check:** Let me factorize 120.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n120 \\div 2 = 60 \\\\\n60 \\div 2 = 30 \\\\\n30 \\div 3 = 10 \\\\\n10 \\div 5 = 2 \\\\\n2 \\div 2 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 120 is:\n\n\\[\n120 = 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, multiplying these factors back gives 120.\n- **Thought:** This tells me that for \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\) to have a terminating decimal, the simplified denominator must only have factors of 2 and 5. Therefore, the factor of 3 must be eliminated.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining Conditions for Terminating Decimals**\n\n**Exploring Different Ideas:**\n\n- **Idea 1:** List all \\( n \\) where \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\) simplifies to a denominator with only 2s and 5s.\n  - **Reaction:** But listing all 120 cases is impractical.\n  - **Reflection:** There must be a better way.\n\n- **Idea 2:** Use the GCD to simplify the fraction and check the remaining factors.\n  - **Insight:** This seems more efficient. If the GCD of \\( n \\) and 120 includes all factors of 3, then the simplified denominator will only have 2s and 5s.\n\n**Settling on Idea 2:**\n\n- **Thought:** Let's go with the GCD approach. I'll calculate the GCD of \\( n \\) and 120 for each \\( n \\), simplify the denominator, and check if only 2s and 5s remain.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the GCD Approach**\n\n**Full Thought Process:**\n\n- **Reaction:** I'll need to iterate over each \\( n \\) from 1 to 120, calculate \\(\\text{gcd}(n, 120)\\), simplify the denominator, and check the factors.\n- **Reflection:** This still seems like a lot of work manually, but I can look for patterns to make it easier.\n\n**Realization:** \n\n- **Wait:** Actually, instead of checking each \\( n \\) individually, I can focus on the factors of 120. If \\( n \\) is a multiple of the factors that include 3, then the simplified denominator will only have 2s and 5s.\n- **Insight:** This simplifies the problem significantly. I only need to count the \\( n \\) that are multiples of 3.\n\n**Oops Moment:**\n\n- **Wait a minute:** I initially thought I needed to exclude multiples of 3, but actually, I need to **include** the multiples of 3. Because when \\( n \\) has a factor of 3, it cancels out the 3 in the denominator, leaving only 2s and 5s.\n- **Reflection:** Hmm, that changes things. I need to adjust my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Correcting the Strategy**\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n- **Thought:** So, the fractions that terminate are those where \\( n \\) is a multiple of 3. This is because the factor of 3 in the denominator will be canceled out, leaving only 2s and 5s.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Idea:** Count all \\( n \\) from 1 to 120 that are multiples of 3.\n- **Reflection:** This seems straightforward. I can calculate the total number of multiples of 3 within the range.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Total \\( n \\):** 120\n\n2. **\\( n \\) divisible by 3:**\n   - **Quick Check:** There are \\( \\frac{120}{3} = 40 \\) multiples of 3 between 1 and 120.\n\n3. **Terminating \\( n \\):**\n   - **Answer:** 40\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, by including the \\( n \\) that have a factor of 3, we ensure that the denominator after simplification only contains 2s and 5s, resulting in a terminating decimal.\n\n**Thought:** This aligns with the condition for terminating decimals, so it seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Full Thought Process:**\n\n- **Reaction:** Before finalizing the answer, let's verify this approach to ensure its correctness.\n- **Reflection:** I can test a few samples to see if the strategy holds.\n\n**Sample Verification:**\n\n- **Test \\( n = 3 \\):**\n  - \\(\\frac{3}{120} = \\frac{1}{40}\\)\n  - Denominator 40 = \\(2^3 \\times 5\\), only factors 2 and 5 \u21d2 **Terminating**\n\n- **Test \\( n = 6 \\):**\n  - \\(\\frac{6}{120} = \\frac{1}{20}\\)\n  - Denominator 20 = \\(2^2 \\times 5\\), only factors 2 and 5 \u21d2 **Terminating**\n\n- **Test \\( n = 9 \\):**\n  - \\(\\frac{9}{120} = \\frac{3}{40}\\)\n  - Denominator 40 = \\(2^3 \\times 5\\), only factors 2 and 5 \u21d2 **Terminating**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Thought:** The samples confirm that when \\( n \\) is a multiple of 3, the simplified denominator contains only 2s and 5s, resulting in a terminating decimal.\n- **Check:** This aligns with our corrected conclusion, so the approach seems valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Idea:** Since the approach has been verified with samples, I can confidently state the final answer.\n- **Reflection:** It's important to present the answer clearly to avoid any ambiguity.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThere are **40** integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 120 inclusive for which \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\) has a terminating decimal representation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the approach with sample calculations, I realized that my initial thought of excluding multiples of 3 was incorrect. Instead, I needed to **include** multiples of 3 to ensure the denominator simplifies to only contain factors of 2 and 5. This adjustment led me to the correct answer: there are **40** integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 120 inclusive for which \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\) terminates.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a minute:** Initially, I misunderstood the role of multiples of 3 in simplifying the denominator. By revisiting my strategy and testing samples, I corrected this error and arrived at the correct solution.\n- **Actually, looking at this again:** Including multiples of 3 is crucial because they cancel out the factor of 3 in the denominator, ensuring that only 2s and 5s remain.\n- **Hmm, let me double-check my reasoning here:** Verifying with sample fractions helped confirm that the corrected approach is valid, reinforcing the correctness of the final answer.\n\n---\n\n**Learner\u2019s Reflection:**\n\nThrough this process, I realized the importance of carefully analyzing the conditions for terminating decimals and correctly identifying which multiples of \\( n \\) satisfy those conditions. By testing sample cases and reflecting on my initial assumptions, I was able to identify and correct the error in my original approach, leading to an accurate solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThere are **40** integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 120 inclusive for which \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\) has a terminating decimal representation.",
  "ground_truth": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $3$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{120-1}{3} \\right\\rfloor+1=40$ multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $120$, so there are $\\boxed{40}$ integers values for $n$."
