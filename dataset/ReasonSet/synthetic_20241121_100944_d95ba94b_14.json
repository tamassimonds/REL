  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like how I'd approach it naturally. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question asks us to find:\n\n\\[2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\]\n\nand express the answer as an integer between 0 and 55.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  This involves modular arithmetic and inverse operations. I remember dealing with modular inverses before, so this looks familiar. But honestly, it's been a while, so I might need to refresh my memory on how to find modular inverses.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**  \n  1. **Find Inverses Directly:** Calculate \\(5^{-1}\\) and \\(11^{-1}\\) modulo 56, then plug them into the expression.\n  2. **Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:** I recall this is useful for finding modular inverses.\n  3. **Check for Alternative Methods:** Maybe there's a simpler way or a property I can use to simplify the problem.\n\n- **Exploring Strategy 1:**  \n  Let\u2019s start by finding the inverses directly. If it works, great; if not, I'll reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding \\(5^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo compute \\(5^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\), I need to find an integer \\(x\\) such that:\n\n\\[5x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}\\]\n\n- **First Attempt:**  \n  Maybe I can guess and check small values of \\(x\\).\n\n  - **Trying \\(x = 1\\):**  \n    \\(5 \\times 1 = 5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{56}\\)  \n    \u27f9 Not equal to 1, so \\(x = 1\\) doesn't work.\n  \n  - **Trying \\(x = 11\\):**  \n    \\(5 \\times 11 = 55 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{56}\\)  \n    \u27f9 Still not 1, but close.\n  \n  - **Trying \\(x = 11 + 1 = 12\\):**  \n    \\(5 \\times 12 = 60 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{56}\\)  \n    \u27f9 Not 1, so \\(x = 12\\) doesn't work.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Guessing is taking too long. Maybe I need a better approach.\n\n**Changing Strategy:**  \nLet's use the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** to find the inverse more systematically.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for \\(5^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe Extended Euclidean Algorithm can find integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that:\n\n\\[ax + by = \\gcd(a, b)\\]\n\nHere, I want:\n\n\\[5x + 56y = 1\\]\n\nbecause the gcd of 5 and 56 is 1.\n\n- **Performing the Euclidean Algorithm:**\n\n  1. **Divide 56 by 5:**  \n     \\(56 = 5 \\times 11 + 1\\)  \n     \u27f9 Remainder is 1, which is the gcd.  \n     \u27f9 \\(1 = 56 - 5 \\times 11\\)  \n     So, \\(5 \\times (-11) + 56 \\times 1 = 1\\).\n\n  2. **Finding \\(x\\):**  \n     Here, \\(x = -11\\).\n\n- **Checking the Inverse:**  \n  So, \\(5 \\times (-11) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}\\).\n\n- **Adjusting \\(x\\) to be Positive:**  \n  Usually, we want the inverse to be a positive integer within the modulus range.  \n  \u27f9 \\(-11 \\equiv 45 \\pmod{56}\\) (since \\(-11 + 56 = 45\\))\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSo, \\(5^{-1} \\equiv 45 \\pmod{56}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding \\(11^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to find \\(11^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\) using the same method.\n\n- **Applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**\n\n  1. **Divide 56 by 11:**  \n     \\(56 = 11 \\times 5 + 1\\)  \n     \u27f9 Remainder is 1, which is the gcd.  \n     \u27f9 \\(1 = 56 - 11 \\times 5\\)  \n     So, \\(11 \\times (-5) + 56 \\times 1 = 1\\).\n\n  2. **Finding \\(x\\):**  \n     Here, \\(x = -5\\).\n\n- **Checking the Inverse:**  \n  So, \\(11 \\times (-5) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}\\).\n\n- **Adjusting \\(x\\) to be Positive:**  \n  \u27f9 \\(-5 \\equiv 51 \\pmod{56}\\) (since \\(-5 + 56 = 51\\))\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSo, \\(11^{-1} \\equiv 51 \\pmod{56}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluating the Expression \\(2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have the inverses, I can substitute them back into the original expression.\n\n- **Substituting the Inverses:**  \n  \\[2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\equiv 2 \\cdot 45 + 8 \\cdot 51 \\pmod{56}\\]\n\n- **Calculating Each Term:**\n\n  1. **First Term:**  \n     \\(2 \\cdot 45 = 90\\)\n\n  2. **Second Term:**  \n     \\(8 \\cdot 51 = 408\\)\n\n- **Adding the Terms Together:**  \n  \\(90 + 408 = 498\\)\n\n- **Applying Modulo 56:**  \n  \\(498 \\mod 56\\)\n\n- **Performing the Division:**  \n  \\[498 \u00f7 56 = 8\\text{ remainder }50\\]  \n  \u27f9 \\(498 \\equiv 50 \\pmod{56}\\)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSo, \n\n\\[2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\equiv 50 \\pmod{56}\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt's always good to double-check the work to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - \\(5 \\times 45 = 225 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}\\) \u27f9 Correct\n  - \\(11 \\times 51 = 561 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}\\) \u27f9 Correct\n\n- **Recalculating the Expression:**  \n  \\[2 \\cdot 45 + 8 \\cdot 51 = 90 + 408 = 498\\]  \n  \\[498 \\mod 56 = 50\\] \u27f9 Correct\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Everything checks out. The calculations are consistent, and the final answer makes sense within the given modulus.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\n\\(\\qquad 2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\equiv 50 \\pmod{56}\\)\n\n\\(\\qquad\\text{So, the final answer is }\\boxed{50}.\\)\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverses and carefully evaluating the expression step by step, I've arrived at the correct solution. Along the way, I explored different strategies, reflected on their effectiveness, and verified each step to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. **Find \\(5^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\):**  \n   Used the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to determine that \\(5^{-1} \\equiv 45 \\pmod{56}\\).\n\n2. **Find \\(11^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\):**  \n   Applied the algorithm again to find \\(11^{-1} \\equiv 51 \\pmod{56}\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the Expression:**  \n   Substituted the inverses into the expression and simplified modulo 56 to obtain the final answer.\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically and being open to adjusting strategies when necessary, I ensured a correct and comprehensive solution.\n\n---\n\n### **<Reflection and Thoughts>**\n\nThroughout this process, I started with an initial strategy of guessing the inverses, but quickly realized it was inefficient. By adapting and utilizing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, I was able to find the inverses systematically. Regularly checking each step ensured that errors were caught early, leading to a reliable final answer. This approach highlights the importance of flexibility and verification in problem-solving.",
  "ground_truth": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 2, 5, 8, and 11 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 25 + \\frac{8}{11} \\equiv \\frac{2 \\cdot 11 + 8 \\cdot 5}{55} \\equiv \\frac{62}{-1} \\equiv -62 \\equiv \\boxed{50} \\pmod{56}.$$Indeed, we can justify this manipulation as follows. Suppose that $n \\equiv 2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}$; then multiplying both sides of the congruence by $55$ (which is relatively prime with $56$) yields that $-n \\equiv 55n \\equiv 22 + 40 \\equiv 62 \\pmod{56}$."
