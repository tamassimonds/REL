    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore each one, check if I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like I would when solving a problem manually. \n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5x + 1}{2x^2 + 5x - 3} = \\frac{2x}{2x - 1}\n\\]\n\nI think, \"This looks like a rational equation\u2014maybe I can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions?\" Cross-multiplying is a technique I remember for solving equations like this, but I'm not entirely sure if it's the best first step. Let me brainstorm a bit more.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Cross-Multiplication:** Multiply both sides to eliminate denominators.\n2. **Factor Both Sides:** Maybe factoring could simplify the equation before cross-multiplying.\n3. **Bring All Terms to One Side:** Set the equation to zero by subtracting one side from the other.\n\nI'm leaning towards **cross-multiplication** as my first strategy because it directly tackles the fractions. If it leads to a complicated expression, I might reconsider and look into factoring or bringing everything to one side. \n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Cross-Multiplication**\n\nLet\u2019s try **cross-multiplying** to see where it leads:\n\n\\[\n(5x + 1)(2x - 1) = (2x)(2x^2 + 5x - 3)\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Okay, multiplying both sides seems straightforward. Let me distribute the terms carefully because messy multiplication can lead to mistakes.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Left Side:\n\n\\[\n(5x + 1)(2x - 1) = 10x^2 - 5x + 2x - 1 = 10x^2 - 3x - 1\n\\]\n\n- Right Side:\n\n\\[\n(2x)(2x^2 + 5x - 3) = 4x^3 + 10x^2 - 6x\n\\]\n\n**Resulting Equation:**\n\n\\[\n10x^2 - 3x - 1 = 4x^3 + 10x^2 - 6x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** At first glance, both sides have a \\(10x^2\\) term, so maybe I can eliminate it.\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nLet's **bring all terms to one side** to simplify:\n\n\\[\n10x^2 - 3x - 1 - (4x^3 + 10x^2 - 6x) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Wait, when I subtract \\(10x^2\\) from both sides, they cancel out. That's nice! Let me continue simplifying.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n10x^2 - 3x - 1 - 4x^3 - 10x^2 + 6x = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-4x^3 + 3x - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Now, I have a cubic equation \\( -4x^3 + 3x - 1 = 0 \\). Hmm, cubic equations can be tricky. Cross-multiplying worked, but maybe factoring might help find the roots more straightforwardly.\n\n**Check:** Is it okay to jump from cross-multiplication directly to solving a cubic? Typically, yes, but given the simplicity of the original equation, perhaps there\u2019s a more elegant solution by factoring.\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Factoring Instead**\n\n**Thoughts:** Let\u2019s see if factoring could simplify things back at the cross-multiplication stage. If I can factor the numerator and denominator before cross-multiplying, maybe the equation becomes simpler.\n\n**Original Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5x + 1}{2x^2 + 5x - 3} = \\frac{2x}{2x - 1}\n\\]\n\n**Brainstorming:** Maybe both sides can be factored to reduce the fraction. Let me attempt that.\n\n**Attempting to Factor:**\n\n1. **Factor the Denominator:** \\(2x^2 + 5x - 3\\)\n\n   - Looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(2 \\times -3 = -6\\) and add to \\(5\\): \n   - The numbers are \\(6\\) and \\(-1\\).\n\n   - Factoring:\n\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 6x - 1x - 3 = (2x^2 + 6x) + (-1x - 3)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 2x(x + 3) - 1(x + 3) = (2x - 1)(x + 3)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Hmmm:** Wait, if I factor the denominator into \\((2x - 1)(x + 3)\\), that might simplify things.\n\n### **Step 4: Rewriting the Equation with Factored Denominator**\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5x + 1}{(2x - 1)(x + 3)} = \\frac{2x}{2x - 1}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** This seems cleaner. Maybe I can cancel out the common terms and simplify directly.\n\n**Strategy Change:** Instead of cross-multiplying right away, I can **cancel** the \\((2x - 1)\\) term from both sides, assuming \\(2x - 1 \\neq 0\\).\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5x + 1}{x + 3} = 2x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, is it valid to cancel \\((2x - 1)\\)? Yes, as long as \\(2x - 1 \\neq 0\\), which we'll check later. This simplification makes it much easier to solve.\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Simplified Equation**\n\nNow, let\u2019s solve:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5x + 1}{x + 3} = 2x\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** This is still a rational equation, but simpler than before. I can solve it by **cross-multiplying** again to eliminate the fraction.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n5x + 1 = 2x(x + 3)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5x + 1 = 2x^2 + 6x\n\\]\n\n**Brainstorming:** Okay, let\u2019s bring all terms to one side again to form a quadratic equation.\n\n\\[\n0 = 2x^2 + 6x - 5x - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0 = 2x^2 + x - 1\n\\]\n\n**New Equation:** \n\n\\[\n2x^2 + x - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Did bringing all terms to one side work out? Yes, now I have a quadratic equation that can potentially be factored or solved using the quadratic formula.\n\n### **Step 6: Attempting to Factor the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thoughts:** Let\u2019s try to factor \\(2x^2 + x - 1\\) to see if it\u2019s factorable.\n\n**Brainstorming:** \n\n- Looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(2 \\times -1 = -2\\) and add to \\(1\\): \n- The numbers are \\(2\\) and \\(-1\\).\n\n**Factoring:**\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + 2x - x - 1 = (2x^2 + 2x) + (-x - 1)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2x(x + 1) - 1(x + 1) = (2x - 1)(x + 1)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Oh, this factors nicely! So, \\(2x^2 + x - 1 = (2x - 1)(x + 1)\\).\n\n**Check:** Does factoring make sense? Let's verify by expanding:\n\n\\[\n(2x - 1)(x + 1) = 2x^2 + 2x - x - 1 = 2x^2 + x - 1\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Yep, it checks out. Now I can set each factor equal to zero to find the solutions.\n\n### **Step 7: Finding the Solutions**\n\nSet each factor to zero:\n\n1. **\\(2x - 1 = 0\\)**\n\n   \\[\n   2x = 1 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **\\(x + 1 = 0\\)**\n\n   \\[\n   x = -1\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, the possible solutions are \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x = -1\\). But wait\u2014remember when I canceled \\((2x - 1)\\), I assumed \\(2x - 1 \\neq 0\\). Let\u2019s check if \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) is valid.\n\n**Check:** \n\n\\[\n2x - 1 = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Oh no, \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) makes the denominator zero, which is not allowed. So, \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) is **not** a valid solution.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only valid solution is \\(x = -1\\).\n\n### **Step 8: Verifying the Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s plug \\(x = -1\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies both sides.\n\n**Original Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5(-1) + 1}{2(-1)^2 + 5(-1) - 3} = \\frac{2(-1)}{2(-1) - 1}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Left Side:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-5 + 1}{2(1) - 5 - 3} = \\frac{-4}{2 - 5 - 3} = \\frac{-4}{-6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n- **Right Side:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-2}{-2 - 1} = \\frac{-2}{-3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Both sides equal \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), so \\(x = -1\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nInitially, I attempted cross-multiplication directly, which led me to a cubic equation. Realizing that the denominators could be factored and simplified before cross-multiplying made the problem much more straightforward. Factoring the quadratic equation yielded the solution, but careful checking ensured that one potential solution was invalid due to a zero denominator.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Cross-Multiplication:** A good starting point for rational equations, but be cautious of canceling terms that might lead to division by zero.\n- **Factoring:** Simplifying fractions by factoring can make solving the equation much easier.\n- **Verifying Solutions:** Always plug back potential solutions into the original equation to ensure validity, especially when simplifying steps that could introduce extraneous solutions.",
