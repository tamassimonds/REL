  "problem": "Is -1 a prime number?",
  "solution": "Certainly! Let's craft a complete solution by emulating a human problem-solving approach\u2014brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness, and adjusting as needed. Here\u2019s how it unfolds:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming**\n\nAlright, the question is whether \\(-1\\) is a prime number. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Hmm, I've dealt with prime numbers before, but usually with positive integers. This feels different since \\(-1\\) is negative.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Recall Definition of Prime Numbers:** Maybe I should start by remembering what it means for a number to be prime.\n  - **Consider Negative Numbers:** Do prime numbers even include negatives?\n  - **Check Factors:** Perhaps I can check if \\(-1\\) has exactly two distinct positive divisors.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure how negative numbers fit into the concept of primes. Let me explore further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Prime Numbers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Defining a Prime Number:** A prime number is traditionally defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait a minute\u2014this definition mentions \"greater than 1\" and \"natural numbers.\" Does that mean negative numbers aren't considered at all?\n\n- **Quick Check:** If primes are only natural numbers (positive integers), then negative numbers like \\(-1\\) wouldn't qualify by default.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n- **Conclusion:** According to the standard definition, \\(-1\\) doesn't meet the criteria because it's not greater than 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Approaches**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Approach 1: Applying the Standard Definition:** Since primes are greater than 1, \\(-1\\) is immediately disqualified.\n\n- **Approach 2: Thinking About Factors:** But wait, let's think about factors. Does \\(-1\\) have exactly two distinct positive divisors?\n\n- **Approach 3: Negative Primes Concept:** Is there even a concept of negative prime numbers?\n\n- **Reflection:** Maybe I need to confirm whether prime numbers can be negative or if \\(-1\\) has unique properties.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n- **Direction:** Still leaning towards \\(-1\\) not being prime, but I want to investigate the factors approach to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Checking Factors of \\(-1\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Listing Divisors:** Let's see what numbers divide \\(-1\\) without leaving a remainder.\n  \n- **Calculations:**\n  - \\(-1 \\div 1 = -1\\) \u21d2 So, 1 is a divisor.\n  - \\(-1 \\div -1 = 1\\) \u21d2 Also, \\(-1\\) is a divisor.\n\n- **Observations:**\n  - There are two divisors: 1 and \\(-1\\).\n  - **But Wait:** The definition of prime numbers requires two distinct *positive* divisors.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Since one of the divisors is negative, does this align with the prime definition?\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n- **Conclusion:** \\(-1\\) does not have two distinct positive divisors. Therefore, it doesn't satisfy the prime number criteria.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Reflecting on the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Considering that prime numbers are defined within the set of natural numbers, and \\(-1\\) is negative, it seems clear that \\(-1\\) isn't prime.\n\n- **Alternative Viewpoints:** Is there any mathematical theory that considers negative primes?\n\n- **Research Insight:** In some advanced mathematical contexts, like Gaussian integers, negative primes are considered, but that's beyond basic prime number definitions.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n- **Final Agreement:** Based on standard definitions, \\(-1\\) is not a prime number.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Check and Validation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Revisiting Definitions:** Prime numbers are greater than 1 and have exactly two distinct positive divisors.\n\n- **Applying to \\(-1\\):**\n  - \\(-1\\) is less than 1.\n  - \\(-1\\) does not have two distinct positive divisors.\n\n- **Is There Any Ambiguity?** None that I can see. All standard definitions exclude \\(-1\\) from being prime.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n- **Confirmation:** The initial conclusion is correct. \\(-1\\) is not a prime number.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>Final Answer</ANSWER>**\n\n**\\(-1\\) is not a prime number.**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, checking each approach, and reflecting on the correctness throughout the process, we've determined that \\(-1\\) does not meet the criteria for being a prime number. The standard definition of prime numbers excludes negative numbers, and \\(-1\\) lacks the necessary properties, such as being greater than 1 and having exactly two distinct positive divisors.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration was helpful!
