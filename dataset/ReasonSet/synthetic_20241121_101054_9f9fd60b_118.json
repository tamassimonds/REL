  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were doing this on paper\u2014brainstorming, checking my work along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nOkay, so here\u2019s what I\u2019m dealing with:\n\n- **Jar A:** Starts with **4 red buttons** and **8 blue buttons**, totaling **12 buttons**.\n- Carla removes an **equal number** of red and blue buttons from Jar A and places them into **Jar B**.\n- After the removal, Jar A has \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of its original number of buttons.\n\n**Goal:** Find the probability that if Carla randomly selects one button from each jar, both buttons will be **red**.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- **Understanding Proportions:** Since Jar A ends up with \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of its original buttons, that means \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) were moved to Jar B. This should help determine how many buttons were removed.\n\n- **Thinking About Probabilities:** Once I know how many red buttons are in each jar, I can calculate the probability of picking a red button from both jars.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Set Up Equations:** Use algebra to find out how many buttons were removed.\n  - **Trial and Error:** Test different numbers to see what fits the conditions.\n  - **Visual Representation:** Draw a diagram to visualize the button transfer.\n\nI think starting with setting up an equation to represent the situation might be the most straightforward approach. If that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll consider other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Setting Up an Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of red and blue buttons removed as \\( x \\). Since Carla removes the **same number** of red and blue buttons, we can use \\( x \\) for both.\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n\n- Original number of buttons in Jar A:  \n  \\( 4 \\text{ (red)} + 8 \\text{ (blue)} = 12 \\)\n  \n- After removing \\( x \\) red and \\( x \\) blue buttons, the total in Jar A is:  \n  \\( 12 - 2x \\)\n  \nGiven that Jar A now has \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of its original buttons:\n\n\\[\n12 - 2x = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 12\n\\]\n\n\\[\n12 - 2x = 8\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\n12 - 2x = 8 \\\\\n-2x = 8 - 12 \\\\\n-2x = -4 \\\\\nx = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a minute, does this make sense?**  \n  Removing 2 red and 2 blue buttons means a total of 4 buttons removed.  \n  \\( 12 - 4 = 8 \\), which is indeed \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of 12.  \n  **So, \\( x = 2 \\) seems correct.**\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Visual Representation (Optional Check)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **What if I draw it out?**  \n  Maybe visualizing the buttons being moved can confirm our calculations.\n\n**Drawing It Out:**\n\n- **Jar A:** Initially has 4 red and 8 blue.  \n- **Removal:** Take out 2 red and 2 blue.  \n- **Remaining in Jar A:**  \n  - **Red:** 4 - 2 = 2  \n  - **Blue:** 8 - 2 = 6  \n  - **Total:** 2 + 6 = 8 (which is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of 12)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Yep, it checks out!**  \n  The visual approach confirms that removing 2 red and 2 blue buttons works.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with the First Strategy**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve confirmed \\( x = 2 \\), let\u2019s move on to calculating the probability.\n\n#### **Step 1: Determine Button Distribution in Both Jars**\n\n**Jar A After Removal:**\n\n- **Red Buttons:** 4 - 2 = 2  \n- **Blue Buttons:** 8 - 2 = 6  \n- **Total Buttons:** 2 + 6 = 8\n\n**Jar B After Transfer:**\n\n- **Red Buttons:** 2  \n- **Blue Buttons:** 2  \n- **Total Buttons:** 2 + 2 = 4\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this add up?**  \n  Yes, the total number of buttons is still 12 (8 in Jar A + 4 in Jar B).  \n  **Everything seems consistent.**\n\n#### **Step 2: Calculate the Probability of Selecting a Red Button from Each Jar**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Probability Basics:**  \n  The probability of two independent events both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\n- **Event 1:** Picking a red button from Jar A.  \n- **Event 2:** Picking a red button from Jar B.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Probability of Picking Red from Jar A (\\( P(A) \\)):**\n\n\\[\nP(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Red Buttons in A}}{\\text{Total Buttons in A}} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) realistic?**  \n  With 2 red out of 8, yes, that's correct.\n\n2. **Probability of Picking Red from Jar B (\\( P(B) \\)):**\n\n\\[\nP(B) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Red Buttons in B}}{\\text{Total Buttons in B}} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) realistic?**  \n  With 2 red out of 4, yes, that makes sense.\n\n3. **Combined Probability (\\( P(A \\text{ and } B) \\)):**\n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) feel right?**  \n  Considering the probabilities from each jar, this seems reasonable.  \n  **But let\u2019s double-check to be sure.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Validation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Double-Checking the Math:**  \n  It\u2019s always good to verify calculations, especially when dealing with probabilities.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:**  \n  Maybe calculate the probability of the complementary event (i.e., not both red) to see if it aligns.\n\n**Alternative Check:**\n\n- **Complementary Probability:**  \n  Calculate the probability that **at least one** of the buttons is **not red**, and subtract from 1.\n\n1. **Probability of Picking a Non-Red from Jar A:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Non-Red in A}) = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\n2. **Probability of Picking a Non-Red from Jar B:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Non-Red in B}) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n3. **Probability of Either or Both Being Non-Red:**\n\n- **Using Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{At least one non-red}) = P(\\text{Non-Red in A}) + P(\\text{Non-Red in B}) - P(\\text{Both Non-Red})\n\\]\n\n4. **Calculating \\( P(\\text{Both Non-Red}) \\):**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Both Non-Red}) = \\frac{6}{8} \\times \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\n\n5. **Putting It Together:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{At least one non-red}) = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{8} \n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{6}{8} + \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}\n\\]\n\n6. **Probability of Both Being Red:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Both Red}) = 1 - P(\\text{At least one non-red}) = 1 - \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this match our original calculation?**  \n  Yes, both methods lead to a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).  \n  **This consistency reassures me that the solution is correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Solution Recap:**\n\n- Carla removed 2 red and 2 blue buttons, leaving Jar A with 2 red and 6 blue buttons, and transferring 2 red and 2 blue buttons to Jar B.\n- The probability of selecting a red button from Jar A is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), and from Jar B is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n- Therefore, the probability of both selected buttons being red is \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully setting up the problem, exploring different strategies, and validating our approach through multiple checks, we arrived at the correct probability. Thinking through each step, reflecting on whether the outcomes make sense, and being open to adjusting strategies are key components of effectively solving such probability problems.\n\n---\n\nAnd there we have it! Through a thoughtful, step-by-step approach, we\u2019ve successfully determined the probability that both selected buttons are red is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "Two-thirds of Jar A's original $4+8=12$ buttons is 8 buttons.  Therefore, four buttons were removed from Jar A: two red buttons and two blue buttons.  So the probability that the button drawn from Jar A is red is $\\frac{2}{8}$ and the probability that the button drawn from Jar B is red is $\\frac{2}{4}$.  Therefore, the probability that both buttons are red is $\\dfrac{2}{8}\\cdot\\dfrac{2}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$."
