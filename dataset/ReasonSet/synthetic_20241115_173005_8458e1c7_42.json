I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work frequently, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The problem involves finding the intersection points of the line \\( y = 3 \\) with the quadratic function \\( y = 4x^2 + x - 1 \\).\n- Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are where these two graphs intersect.\n- I need to determine the distance between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), which is likely a horizontal distance since \\( y \\) is constant at 3.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Set the equations equal to find the \\( x \\)-coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n- **Strategy 2:** Use the distance formula to calculate the distance between the two points once I have both \\( x \\)-coordinates.\n- **Alternative Thought:** Maybe sketching a rough graph would help visualize, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for just calculating the distance.\n\n**Reflecting:**\n\n- Setting the equations equal seems straightforward to find the intersection points.\n- I should double-check that both \\( x \\)-coordinates lead to real solutions to ensure \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are distinct and real.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Find the Intersection Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- To find where the line \\( y = 3 \\) intersects the quadratic \\( y = 4x^2 + x - 1 \\), I\u2019ll set the two equations equal to each other.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n3 = 4x^2 + x - 1\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n4x^2 + x - 1 - 3 = 0 \\\\\n4x^2 + x - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This is a quadratic equation in standard form. Now, I need to solve for \\( x \\) using the quadratic formula or factoring if possible.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Quadratic Formula:** Since the coefficients are manageable, this might be the most straightforward method.\n2. **Attempt Factoring:** Check if the quadratic can be factored easily.\n   \n**Checking if Factoring is Possible:**\n\n- Looking at \\( 4x^2 + x - 4 \\)):\n    - Product of \\( a \\times c = 4 \\times (-4) = -16 \\)\n    - Need two numbers that multiply to \\( -16 \\) and add to \\( 1 \\)\n\n- Possible pairs: \\( (4, -4) \\), \\( (2, -8) \\), but none add up to \\( 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Factoring doesn\u2019t seem to work here. Let's proceed with the quadratic formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Apply the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The quadratic formula is \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\).\n- For our equation \\( 4x^2 + x - 4 = 0 \\):\n    - \\( a = 4 \\)\n    - \\( b = 1 \\)\n    - \\( c = -4 \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{(1)^2 - 4 \\times 4 \\times (-4)}}{2 \\times 4} \\\\\nx = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 64}}{8} \\\\\nx = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{65}}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- So, the two \\( x \\)-coordinates are:\n    - \\( x_A = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{65}}{8} \\)\n    - \\( x_B = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{65}}{8} \\)\n\n- Both solutions are real and distinct. This confirms that points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are real and different.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- The discriminant \\( (1 + 64) = 65 \\) is positive, so there are two distinct real solutions. Everything seems correct so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Distance Between Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The distance between two points on a horizontal line is simply the difference between their \\( x \\)-coordinates.\n- Since \\( y = 3 \\) for both points, the \\( y \\)-coordinates are the same, so the distance is purely horizontal.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = |x_A - x_B| \\\\\n= \\left| \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{65}}{8} - \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{65}}{8} \\right| \\\\\n= \\left| \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{65} + 1 + \\sqrt{65}}{8} \\right| \\\\\n= \\left| \\frac{2\\sqrt{65}}{8} \\right| \\\\\n= \\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The distance is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{4} \\).\n- This matches the form \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{n} \\) where \\( m = 65 \\) and \\( n = 4 \\).\n- Both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers and share no common factors other than one.\n\n**Checking the Result:**\n\n- The calculations seem consistent and correct.\n- The distance makes sense given the \\( x \\)-coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Find \\( m - n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- According to the problem, \\( m = 65 \\) and \\( n = 4 \\).\n- I need to compute \\( m - n \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nm - n = 65 - 4 = 61\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The final answer is \\( 61 \\).\n- Everything checks out - the distance calculation is correct, and the values of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are appropriately identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Intersection Points:**  \n  - \\( A \\left( \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{65}}{8}, 3 \\right) \\)  \n  - \\( B \\left( \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{65}}{8}, 3 \\right) \\)  \n  \n- **Distance Between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):**  \n  - \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{4} \\)  \n  \n- **Values of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\):**  \n  - \\( m = 65 \\)  \n  - \\( n = 4 \\)  \n  \n- **Final Answer:**  \n  - \\( m - n = 61 \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validation:**  \n  - Initially considered factoring but realized it wasn\u2019t feasible. The quadratic formula was the appropriate method.\n    \n- **Calculation Checks:**  \n  - Throughout, ensured each step followed logically. Quick checks confirmed the discriminant was positive, leading to real solutions.\n    \n- **End Result Reliability:**  \n  - The final answer aligns with the required form, and all calculations are consistent.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, reflecting, and checking, led to a confident and correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "In order for the graphs of $y=3$ and $y=4x^2 + x -1$ to intersect, we must have $3 = 4x^2 + x - 1$, so $4x^2 + x - 4 = 0$. By the quadratic formula, if $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, then $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a};$$the (positive) difference of these two roots is given by $\\left|\\frac{\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}\\right|$. Since $A$ and $B$ lie on a horizontal line, it follows that this difference is the distance $AB$. Substituting the given values, we have that the answer is $\\left|\\frac{\\sqrt{1^2-4(4)(-4)}}{4}\\right| = \\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{4}$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{61}$."
