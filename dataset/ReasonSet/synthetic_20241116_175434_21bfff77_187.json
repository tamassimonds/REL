    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, and checking along the way. I\u2019ll take you through my thought process step by step, exploring various approaches, acknowledging when something doesn\u2019t work, and adjusting as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Type of Problem:** We're dealing with the intersection of a line and a parabola. Specifically, the line \\( x = k \\) intersects the parabola \\( x = -2y^2 - 3y + 5 \\) at exactly one point.\n  \n- **Goal:** We need to find the value of \\( k \\) where this intersection occurs.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems where the line is tangent to the parabola, meaning there should be exactly one point of intersection. The concept of tangency comes to mind.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure how to approach this. Should I set up an equation and solve for \\( k \\), or is there a geometric property I can leverage?\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Set the Equations Equal**\n\n- **Thought:** Maybe I can set the equation of the line equal to the equation of the parabola because at the point of intersection, both equations should hold true.\n\n- **Expression:** If \\( x = k \\), then \\( k = -2y^2 - 3y + 5 \\).\n\n- **Resulting Equation:** This would give me \\( -2y^2 - 3y + 5 - k = 0 \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, this is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). For there to be exactly one solution (one point of intersection), the quadratic must have exactly one root. That means the discriminant should be zero.\n\n- **Potential Issue:** Am I sure that the discriminant being zero is enough? It feels right because tangency implies one solution.\n\n- **Checkpoint:** Yes, that makes sense. Let\u2019s proceed with this strategy and see if it leads to a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Executing Strategy 1: Quadratic Equation and Discriminant**\n\n**Step 1:** Set up the quadratic equation.\n\nGiven:\n\\[\nk = -2y^2 - 3y + 5\n\\]\nRearranged:\n\\[\n-2y^2 - 3y + (5 - k) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Recognizing the Form:** This is a standard quadratic equation \\( Ay^2 + By + C = 0 \\) where:\n  - \\( A = -2 \\)\n  - \\( B = -3 \\)\n  - \\( C = 5 - k \\)\n\n- **Objective:** For there to be exactly one solution for \\( y \\), the discriminant (\\( \\Delta \\)) must be zero.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the discriminant.\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC = (-3)^2 - 4(-2)(5 - k) = 9 + 8(5 - k)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 9 + 40 - 8k = 49 - 8k\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Simplification:** I\u2019ve expanded the discriminant. Now, set \\( \\Delta = 0 \\) because that's the condition for tangency.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Checking Work:** Does it make sense that the discriminant needs to be zero? Yes, because only then will the quadratic equation have exactly one solution.\n\n- **Next Step:** Let\u2019s solve for \\( k \\).\n\n**Step 3:** Set the discriminant to zero and solve for \\( k \\).\n\n\\[\n49 - 8k = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n8k = 49\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{49}{8} = 6.125\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Solution:**\n\n- **Calculation Check:** Does \\( k = \\frac{49}{8} \\) seem reasonable? Let's verify:\n  - Multiply \\( 8 \\times 6.125 = 49 \\), which matches our equation.\n\n- **Conceptual Check:** If \\( k = \\frac{49}{8} \\), then the line \\( x = \\frac{49}{8} \\) should be tangent to the parabola, meaning they intersect at exactly one point.\n\n- **Intuition:** This value of \\( k \\) aligns with the condition of tangency.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** By setting the quadratic's discriminant to zero, I ensured that the line intersects the parabola at exactly one point.\n\n- **Answer Check:** The calculated \\( k = \\frac{49}{8} \\) seems consistent with the requirement of a single point of intersection.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Initially, I considered other methods like examining the vertex of the parabola or using graphical approaches, but setting the equations equal and solving for the discriminant proved straightforward and effective.\n\n- **Mistake Check:** There doesn\u2019t seem to be any mistake in the calculations. Each step logically follows from the previous one.\n\n- **Final Conclusion:** The value of \\( k \\) that satisfies the condition is \\( \\frac{49}{8} \\) or 6.125.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Vertex Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Exploring Another Method:** Another way to ensure the line is tangent to the parabola is to find the vertex of the parabola and set \\( k \\) equal to the x-coordinate of the vertex. This is because the tangent line at the vertex is the only line that touches the parabola at a single point when the line is vertical.\n\n- **Vertex Formula for Parabolas:** For a parabola of the form \\( x = ay^2 + by + c \\), the y-coordinate of the vertex is given by \\( y = \\frac{-b}{2a} \\).\n\n- **Applying to Our Parabola:**\n  \\[\n  a = -2, \\quad b = -3, \\quad c = 5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y_{\\text{vertex}} = \\frac{-(-3)}{2 \\times -2} = \\frac{3}{-4} = -\\frac{3}{4}\n  \\]\n\n- **Substituting Back to Find \\( k \\):**\n  \\[\n  k = -2\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 - 3\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right) + 5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = -2\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) + \\frac{9}{4} + 5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = -\\frac{18}{16} + \\frac{9}{4} + 5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = -\\frac{9}{8} + \\frac{18}{8} + \\frac{40}{8}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{49}{8} = 6.125\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Cross-Verification:** Using the vertex approach also yields \\( k = \\frac{49}{8} \\). This confirms the validity of the initial method.\n\n- **Alternative Insight:** This alternative strategy reinforces the solution, showing that \\( k = \\frac{49}{8} \\) is correct from different angles.\n\n- **Final Check:** Both methods lead to the same \\( k \\), adding confidence to the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies\u2014setting the quadratic equation's discriminant to zero and leveraging the vertex formula\u2014we arrived at the same solution: \\( k = \\frac{49}{8} \\) or 6.125. Reflecting and verifying along the way ensured the approach was correct and the solution valid. This step-by-step, reflective approach mirrors human problem-solving, accommodating brainstorming, checking, and adjusting as needed.",
