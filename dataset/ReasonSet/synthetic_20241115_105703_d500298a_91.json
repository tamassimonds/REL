I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, reflect, and check my work as I go, just like I would if I were tackling this problem on my own.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see it's about a Fermi gas of relativistic electrons confined in a spherical cloud with uniform mass density. The equilibrium pressure is a balance between the outward pressure of the gas and the inward gravitational pressure.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n- **Pressure Balance:** It reminds me of problems involving hydrostatic equilibrium, where internal and external pressures balance.\n- **Relativistic Electrons:** The term \"relativistic\" stands out. Maybe I need to consider relativistic effects, which could involve concepts like the Fermi momentum or energy-momentum relation.\n- **Proportionality:** The ground state pressure is proportional to a function of mass \\( M \\) and radius \\( R \\). This suggests I need to find a relationship that links these quantities.\n\nAt this point, I'm not exactly sure how to connect all these pieces, but I have some ideas swirling in my mind. Let's explore them.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Hydrostatic Equilibrium Approach:**\n   - Maybe I can start by writing down the hydrostatic equilibrium condition where the gravitational pressure equals the gas pressure.\n   \n2. **Relativistic Fermi Gas Properties:**\n   - Look into the properties of a relativistic Fermi gas, perhaps using the Fermi energy or Fermi radius.\n   \n3. **Dimensional Analysis:**\n   - Perhaps I can use dimensional analysis to see which options make dimensional sense.\n   \n4. **Thermodynamic Relationships:**\n   - Utilize thermodynamic equations related to pressure, volume, and temperature for ideal gases, adapting them for relativistic conditions.\n\nI'm leaning towards starting with **hydrostatic equilibrium**, as it directly relates the pressures involved. But I might need to incorporate **relativistic gas properties** to account for the electron's behavior.\n\n### **Step 1: Hydrostatic Equilibrium Concept**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Hydrostatic equilibrium means the pressure gradient in the gas is balanced by gravitational pressure.\n- In a static situation, the integration of pressure differential across the radius yields the relationship between \\( M \\) and \\( R \\).\n\n**Equation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{dp}{dr} = -\\frac{GM(r)}{r^2}\n\\]\nWhere:\n- \\( \\frac{dp}{dr} \\) is the pressure gradient,\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n- \\( M(r) \\) is the mass enclosed within radius \\( r \\).\n\n**Start with Simplifying Assumptions:**\n- Assume mass density \\( \\rho \\) is uniform, so \\( M(r) = \\rho \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\).\n\n**Compute \\( \\frac{dp}{dr} \\):**\n\\[\n\\frac{dp}{dr} = -\\frac{G \\rho \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}{r^2} = -\\frac{4}{3} \\pi G \\rho r\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This equation looks familiar from hydrostatic equilibrium in stars.\n- But, I need to link \\( p \\) to \\( M \\) and \\( R \\) and see if the proportionality matches any of the options.\n\n**Check for Plausibility:**\n- Does this gradient make sense? Yes, because pressure decreases linearly with \\( r \\) for uniform density.\n\n**Next Step: Relate Pressure \\( p \\) to \\( M \\) and \\( R \\)**\n\n### **Step 2: Integrate Pressure Gradient to Find \\( p \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find the pressure \\( p \\), integrate \\( \\frac{dp}{dr} \\) with respect to \\( r \\).\n- This will give me an expression for pressure as a function of radius.\n\n**Integration:**\n\\[\np(r) = \\int \\left(-\\frac{4}{3} \\pi G \\rho r\\right) dr = -\\frac{2}{3} \\pi G \\rho r^2 + C\n\\]\nWhere \\( C \\) is a constant of integration.\n\n**Boundary Condition:**\n- At the center \\( r = 0 \\), pressure should be maximum, so \\( p(0) = \\frac{3}{5} \\rho c^2 \\) (for a relativistic Fermi gas, considering Fermi energy).\n\n**Calculate \\( C \\):**\n\\[\np(0) = \\frac{3}{5} \\rho c^2 = C \\implies C = \\frac{3}{5} \\rho c^2\n\\]\n\n**Updated Pressure Equation:**\n\\[\np(r) = -\\frac{2}{3} \\pi G \\rho r^2 + \\frac{3}{5} \\rho c^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This equation relates pressure to radius with a constant term.\n- It's starting to look like a balance between gravitational and internal pressures.\n\n**Check for Consistency:**\n- The pressure decreases quadratically with \\( r \\), which makes physical sense since gravitational pressure increases with \\( R \\).\n\n**Next Step: Incorporate Density \\( \\rho \\) in Terms of \\( M \\) and \\( R \\)**\n\n### **Step 3: Express \\( \\rho \\) in Terms of \\( M \\) and \\( R \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since mass density \\( \\rho \\) is uniform, express \\( \\rho \\) in terms of total mass \\( M \\) and volume \\( V \\).\n- For a sphere, \\( V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{M}{V} = \\frac{3M}{4\\pi R^3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This substitution will help link \\( p \\) to \\( M \\) and \\( R \\).\n- It's a common step in problems involving spherical symmetry and uniform density.\n\n**Check for Plausibility:**\n- \\( \\rho \\) decreases with \\( R^3 \\), which makes sense as volume increases with the cube of the radius.\n\n**Next Step: Substitute \\( \\rho \\) Back into the Pressure Equation**\n\n### **Step 4: Substitute \\( \\rho \\) into the Pressure Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- By substituting \\( \\rho \\) into the pressure equation, I can eliminate \\( \\rho \\) and express \\( p \\) solely in terms of \\( M \\) and \\( R \\).\n\n**Substitution:**\n\\[\np(r) = -\\frac{2}{3} \\pi G \\left(\\frac{3M}{4\\pi R^3}\\right) r^2 + \\frac{3}{5} \\left(\\frac{3M}{4\\pi R^3}\\right) c^2\n\\]\n\n**Simplify:**\n\\[\np(r) = -\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3M}{4R^3} \\times r^2 + \\frac{9}{20} \\times \\frac{3M}{4\\pi R^3} \\times c^2\n\\]\n\\[\np(r) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{3M}{R^3} \\times r^2 + \\frac{27M}{80\\pi R^3} \\times c^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\np(r) = \\frac{3M}{2R^3} \\left(- r^2 + \\frac{9}{40\\pi} \\times c^2 \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Now, \\( p \\) is expressed in terms of \\( M \\) and \\( R \\), but the correlation doesn't immediately match any of the options.\n- Maybe I need to set \\( r = R \\) to find the pressure at the surface.\n\n**Next Step: Evaluate \\( p \\) at \\( r = R \\)**\n\n### **Step 5: Compute Pressure at the Surface \\( r = R \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find the pressure at the surface of the sphere, set \\( r = R \\) in the pressure equation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\np(R) = \\frac{3M}{2R^3} \\left(- R^2 + \\frac{9}{40\\pi} \\times c^2 \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\np(R) = \\frac{3M}{2R^3} \\left( -R^2 + \\frac{27c^2}{40\\pi} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\np(R) = \\frac{3M}{2R^3} \\times \\left( -R^2 + \\frac{27c^2}{40\\pi} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The pressure at the surface depends on both \\( M \\), \\( R \\), and the constant \\( c \\).\n- We need to analyze the term \\( \\frac{27c^2}{40\\pi} \\) to see its significance.\n\n**Check for Consistency:**\n- \\( c \\) is related to the speed of light, and its square divided by \\( \\pi \\) indicates a dimensional quantity.\n- Does it simplify to something meaningful? Let's see.\n\n**Next Step: Simplify the Expression Further**\n\n### **Step 6: Simplify the Surface Pressure Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Try to simplify the pressure expression by factoring out constants and seeing if it matches any of the options.\n\n**Factor Out Constants:**\n\\[\np(R) = \\frac{3M}{2R^3} \\times \\left( -R^2 + \\frac{27c^2}{40\\pi} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\np(R) = \\frac{3M}{2R^3} \\times \\left( -R^2 + \\frac{27c^2}{40\\pi} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Simplify Terms:**\n- Observe that \\( \\frac{27c^2}{40\\pi} \\) is a constant term.\n- Can we relate it to \\( M \\) or \\( R \\)?\n\n**Reflection:**\n- At this stage, the term \\( \\frac{27c^2}{40\\pi} \\) does not directly correlate with \\( M \\) or \\( R \\) in a simple way.\n- This suggests that perhaps the proportionality isn't straightforward or that additional relationships need to be considered.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Maybe I need to consider the **Fermi energy** and its relation to \\( c \\) and \\( \\rho \\).\n\n**Check for Plausibility:**\n- The Fermi energy \\( E_F \\) is related to the density and could link to \\( c \\).\n- Perhaps I need to introduce **Fermi momentum** or **quantum statistical effects**.\n\n**Next Step: Incorporate Fermi Energy into the Equations**\n\n### **Step 7: Relate Fermi Energy to Pressure and Density**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Recall that for a relativistic Fermi gas, the **Fermi energy** \\( E_F \\) is related to the density \\( \\rho \\).\n- Specifically, \\( E_F = \\frac{pc}{\\tau} = \\frac{h}{\\tau} \\).\n\n**Relate Fermi Energy \\( E_F \\) to Density:**\n\\[\nE_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2M} \\left( \\frac{3\\pi^2}{V} \\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2M} (3\\pi^2)^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\frac{1}{R^2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Introducing \\( E_F \\) brings in \\( \\hbar \\), Planck's constant, and relates energy to density and volume.\n- This connection might help in simplifying the pressure expression further.\n\n**Check for Consistency:**\n- Does this make sense? Integrating \\( E_F \\) into the pressure equation could provide a cleaner link between \\( M \\), \\( R \\), and \\( p \\).\n\n**Next Step: Substitute \\( E_F \\) into the Pressure Expression**\n\n### **Step 8: Substitute \\( E_F \\) Back into the Pressure Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- By plugging the expression for \\( E_F \\) into the pressure equation, I can eliminate \\( \\rho \\) and express \\( p \\) solely in terms of \\( M \\) and \\( R \\).\n\n**Substitution:**\n\\[\np(R) = \\frac{3M}{2R^3} \\times \\left( -R^2 + \\frac{27E_F^2}{40\\pi} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\np(R) = \\frac{3M}{2R^3} \\times \\left( -R^2 + \\frac{27}{40\\pi} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2M} (3\\pi^2)^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\frac{1}{R^2} \\right)^2 \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\np(R) = \\frac{3M}{2R^3} \\times \\left( -R^2 + \\frac{27}{40\\pi} \\times \\frac{\\hbar^4}{4M^2} (3\\pi^2)^{\\frac{4}{3}} \\frac{1}{R^4} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The expression is getting complicated, and introducing \\( E_F \\) seems to complicate things further.\n- Perhaps this isn't the right path.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Wait, introducing \\( E_F \\) makes the equation too complex.\n- Maybe there's another way.\n\n**Check for Plausibility:**\n- This doesn't align well with the given options.\n- Perhaps I should consider a different approach.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Dimensional Analysis**\n\n### **Step 9: Dimensional Analysis to Simplify the Relationship**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Use dimensional analysis to see if I can relate \\( M \\) and \\( R \\) to the pressure \\( p \\) without delving too deep into quantum details.\n\n**Options Provided:**\n(A) \\( \\frac{M^2}{R^4} \\)  \n(B) \\( \\frac{M^2}{R^3} \\)  \n(C) \\( \\frac{M}{R^3} \\)  \n(D) \\( \\frac{M}{R^2} \\)\n\n**Dimensional Considerations:**\n- Pressure \\( p \\) has units of force per area: \\( \\frac{kg \\cdot m^{-1}}{sec^2} \\).\n- Let's analyze each option to see if it matches the dimensions of pressure.\n\n**Option (A):**\n\\[\n\\frac{M^2}{R^4} = \\frac{(kg)^2}{(m^4)} = \\frac{kg^2}{m^4} \\rightarrow \\text{Dimensional mismatch}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{kg \\cdot m^{-1}}{sec^2} \\rightarrow \\text{Force per area}\n\\]\n\n**Option (B):**\n\\[\n\\frac{M^2}{R^3} = \\frac{(kg)^2}{(m^3)} = \\frac{kg^2}{m^3} \\rightarrow \\text{Dimensional mismatch}\n\\]\n\n**Option (C):**\n\\[\n\\frac{M}{R^3} = \\frac{kg}{m^3} = \\frac{kg}{m^3} \\rightarrow \\text{Dimensional match}\n\\]\n\n**Option (D):**\n\\[\n\\frac{M}{R^2} = \\frac{kg}{m^2} = \\frac{kg}{m^2} \\rightarrow \\text{Dimensional match}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Only **Option (C)** \\( \\frac{M}{R^3} \\) and **Option (D)** \\( \\frac{M}{R^2} \\) have the dimensions of pressure.\n- Since the problem states that the pressure in the ground state is proportional to \\( \\frac{M}{R^2} \\), this seems plausible.\n\n**Next Step: Verify Against the Physical Context**\n\n### **Step 10: Verification Against Physical Principles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's see if the options \\( \\frac{M}{R^3} \\) or \\( \\frac{M}{R^2} \\) make sense in the context of relativistic Fermi gases and hydrostatic equilibrium.\n\n**Option (C): \\( \\frac{M}{R^3} \\):**\n- This would imply that pressure inversely scales with the cube of the radius.\n- In general, for stellar structures (non-relativistic), pressure decreases with radius cubed. \n\n**Option (D): \\( \\frac{M}{R^2} \\):**\n- This suggests that pressure scales inversely with the square of the radius.\n- In hydrostatic equilibrium, especially for non-relativistic gases, pressure decreases with \\( R^2 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Option (D)** \\( \\frac{M}{R^2} \\) aligns well with hydrostatic equilibrium for classical and quantum gases, where gravitational and internal pressures balance.\n- **Option (C)** \\( \\frac{M}{R^3} \\), while dimensionally correct, doesn't intuitively fit into standard hydrostatic equilibrium, where pressures typically relate to \\( R^2 \\).\n\n**Realization:**\n- Therefore, the correct proportionality should be \\( \\frac{M}{R^2} \\), aligning with the hydrostatic equilibrium condition.\n\n**Check for Consistency:**\n- Does this match the given options?
