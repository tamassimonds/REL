When I first read this, I'm reminded of constraints involving digit positions, which might be similar to problems where certain digits can't be zero or have to be within specific ranges. \n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **List Out Possibilities:** Maybe start by listing all possible 3-digit numbers and filtering those that meet the condition.\n2. **Use Digit Constraints:** Think about the maximum and minimum values each digit can take and how they relate to each other.\n3. **Create Equations or Inequalities:** Set up mathematical relationships between the digits to find valid combinations.\n4. **Combinatorial Approach:** Count the valid combinations of digits while adhering to the condition.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nListing all 3-digit numbers seems impractical because there are 900 of them (from 100 to 999). So, perhaps a more systematic approach, like using digit constraints or combinatorics, would be better. Let me explore these strategies further.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Exploring the Digit Constraints Approach\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's consider the possible values for each digit:\n\n- **Hundreds Digit (H):** Can be from 1 to 9 (can't be 0, as it's a 3-digit number).\n- **Tens Digit (T):** Can be from 0 to 9.\n- **Units Digit (U):** Can be from 0 to 9.\n\nThe condition is \\( U \\geq 2 \\times T \\). This imposes a relationship between the tens and units digits.\n\n**Strategy:**  \nFor each possible value of the tens digit \\( T \\), determine the valid units digits \\( U \\) that satisfy \\( U \\geq 2 \\times T \\). Then, multiply the number of valid \\( U \\) for each \\( T \\) by the number of possible hundreds digits \\( H \\) (which is 9) to get the total.\n\n**Let\u2019s Break It Down:**\n\n1. **Calculate Valid \\( U \\) for Each \\( T \\):**\n   - \\( T = 0 \\): \\( U \\geq 0 \\) \u2192 \\( U = 0 \\) to 9 (10 options)\n   - \\( T = 1 \\): \\( U \\geq 2 \\) \u2192 \\( U = 2 \\) to 9 (8 options)\n   - \\( T = 2 \\): \\( U \\geq 4 \\) \u2192 \\( U = 4 \\) to 9 (6 options)\n   - \\( T = 3 \\): \\( U \\geq 6 \\) \u2192 \\( U = 6 \\) to 9 (4 options)\n   - \\( T = 4 \\): \\( U \\geq 8 \\) \u2192 \\( U = 8 \\) to 9 (2 options)\n   - \\( T = 5 \\) to \\( T = 9 \\): \\( U \\geq 10 \\) \u2192 No valid \\( U \\) (0 options)\n\n**Realization:**  \nWait, this makes sense. For \\( T \\geq 5 \\), \\( 2 \\times T \\) exceeds 9, which is the maximum value for \\( U \\). So, no valid units digit exists for those tens digits.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe calculation seems correct so far. Let's proceed to multiply the number of valid \\( U \\) by the number of hundreds digits.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Calculating the Total Number of Valid 3-Digit Numbers\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that we know how many valid \\( U \\) there are for each \\( T \\), we can calculate the total by considering all possible \\( H \\) (hundreds digits).\n\n**Strategy:**  \nFor each \\( T \\) from 0 to 9, multiply the number of valid \\( U \\) by 9 (the number of possible \\( H \\)). Then, sum these products to get the total number of valid 3-digit numbers.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Total} & = \\sum_{T=0}^{9} (\\text{Number of valid } U \\text{ for each } T) \\times 9 \\\\\n& = 10 \\times 9 \\text{ (for } T=0\\text{)} \\\\\n& + 8 \\times 9 \\text{ (for } T=1\\text{)} \\\\\n& + 6 \\times 9 \\text{ (for } T=2\\text{)} \\\\\n& + 4 \\times 9 \\text{ (for } T=3\\text{)} \\\\\n& + 2 \\times 9 \\text{ (for } T=4\\text{)} \\\\\n& + 0 \\times 9 \\text{ (for } T=5 \\text{ to } T=9\\text{)} \\\\\n& = 90 + 72 + 54 + 36 + 18 + 0 \\\\\n& = 270\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nHmm, let me quickly check if this makes sense. Each \\( U \\) is counted for every possible \\( H \\), and the sums align with the number of valid \\( U \\) for each \\( T \\). The approach seems sound.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe total number of valid 3-digit numbers is 270. This approach worked well by systematically examining each tens digit and its corresponding units digits, ensuring all constraints were met.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Verifying the Solution with an Alternative Method\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEven though the first method gave a clear answer, it's always good to verify using another approach to ensure accuracy. Maybe there's a combinatorial way to look at it that could confirm our result.\n\n**Brainstorming Alternative Strategies:**\n1. **Combinatorial Counting:** Consider combinations where the units digit is constrained by the tens digit.\n2. **Using Inequalities:** Set up inequalities to directly count valid digit combinations.\n\n**Exploring Combinatorial Counting:**\n\n**Strategy:**  \nInstead of calculating the number of valid \\( U \\) for each \\( T \\) separately, let's consider the overall constraints and see if we can simplify the counting process.\n\n**Idea:**  \nFor each hundreds digit \\( H \\), count how many 3-digit numbers starting with \\( H \\) meet the condition \\( U \\geq 2 \\times T \\). Then, sum these counts across all possible \\( H \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **For Each \\( H \\) from 1 to 9:**\n   - Count valid \\( T \\) and corresponding \\( U \\).\n\nLet's do this step by step:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nH = 1: & \\\\\n& T = 0: U \\geq 0 \\rightarrow 10 \\text{ options} \\\\\n& T = 1: U \\geq 2 \\rightarrow 8 \\text{ options} \\\\\n& T = 2: U \\geq 4 \\rightarrow 6 \\text{ options} \\\\\n& T = 3: U \\geq 6 \\rightarrow 4 \\text{ options} \\\\\n& T = 4: U \\geq 8 \\rightarrow 2 \\text{ options} \\\\\n& T = 5 \\text{ to } 9: U \\geq 10 \\rightarrow 0 \\text{ options} \\\\\n& \\text{Total for } H = 1: 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 30\n\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Repeat for \\( H = 2 \\) to \\( H = 9 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nH = 2: & \\\\\n& T = 0: U \\geq 0 \\rightarrow 10 \\\\\n& T = 1: U \\geq 2 \\rightarrow 8 \\\\\n& T = 2: U \\geq 4 \\rightarrow 6 \\\\\n& T = 3: U \\geq 6 \\rightarrow 4 \\\\\n& T = 4: U \\geq 8 \\rightarrow 2 \\\\\n& T = 5 \\text{ to } 9: 0 \\\\\n& \\text{Total: } 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 30 \\\\\n\nH = 3: & \\\\\n& T = 0: 10 \\\\\n& T = 1: 8 \\\\\n& T = 2: 6 \\\\\n& T = 3: 4 \\\\\n& T = 4: 2 \\\\\n& T = 5 \\text{ to } 9: 0 \\\\\n& \\text{Total: } 30 \\\\\n\nH = 4: & \\\\\n& T = 0: 10 \\\\\n& T = 1: 8 \\\\\n& T = 2: 6 \\\\\n& T = 3: 4 \\\\\n& T = 4: 2 \\\\\n& T = 5 \\text{ to } 9: 0 \\\\\n& \\text{Total: } 30 \\\\\n\nH = 5: & \\\\\n& T = 0: 10 \\\\\n& T = 1: 8 \\\\\n& T = 2: 6 \\\\\n& T = 3: 4 \\\\\n& T = 4: 2 \\\\\n& T = 5 \\text{ to } 9: 0 \\\\\n& \\text{Total: } 30 \\\\\n\nH = 6: & \\\\\n& T = 0: 10 \\\\\n& T = 1: 8 \\\\\n& T = 2: 6 \\\\\n& T = 3: 4 \\\\\n& T = 4: 2 \\\\\n& T = 5 \\text{ to } 9: 0 \\\\\n& \\text{Total: } 30 \\\\\n\nH = 7: & \\\\\n& T = 0: 10 \\\\\n& T = 1: 8 \\\\\n& T = 2: 6 \\\\\n& T = 3: 4 \\\\\n& T = 4: 2 \\\\\n& T = 5 \\text{ to } 9: 0 \\\\\n& \\text{Total: } 30 \\\\\n\nH = 8: & \\\\\n& T = 0: 10 \\\\\n& T = 1: 8 \\\\\n& T = 2: 6 \\\\\n& T = 3: 4 \\\\\n& T = 4: 2 \\\\\n& T = 5 \\text{ to } 9: 0 \\\\\n& \\text{Total: } 30 \\\\\n\nH = 9: & \\\\\n& T = 0: 10 \\\\\n& T = 1: 8 \\\\\n& T = 2: 6 \\\\\n& T = 3: 4 \\\\\n& T = 4: 2 \\\\\n& T = 5 \\text{ to } 9: 0 \\\\\n& \\text{Total: } 30 \\\\\n\n& \\text{Grand Total: } 30 \\times 9 = 270\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, this is interesting. By considering each hundreds digit separately, we still arrive at the same total of 270. This confirms that the initial method was correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUsing an alternative approach not only validates the solution but also provides a different perspective on solving the problem. It reassures me that the original method was accurate.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Final Reflection and Conclusion\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBoth methods\u2014calculating valid \\( U \\) for each \\( T \\) and counting valid \\( T \\) and \\( U \\) for each \\( H \\)\u2014yielded the same result. This consistency strengthens the confidence in the solution. Throughout the process, checking calculations and reflecting on the correctness helped maintain accuracy.\n\n**Possible Missteps:**  \nInitially, I considered listing all 3-digit numbers, which seemed time-consuming. By opting for digit constraints and combinatorial counting, the solution became more efficient. Ensuring that \\( U \\geq 2 \\times T \\) was correctly applied was crucial, especially noting that for \\( T \\geq 5 \\), no valid \\( U \\) existed.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \nApproaching the problem from multiple angles not only confirmed the correctness but also deepened the understanding of the relationship between the digits. When faced with uncertainty, exploring different strategies and verifying results can lead to a robust solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are **270** 3-digit numbers where the units digit is at least twice the tens digit.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed walkthrough mimics a human-like thought process, exploring various strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, checking for correctness, and adjusting approaches as needed.
