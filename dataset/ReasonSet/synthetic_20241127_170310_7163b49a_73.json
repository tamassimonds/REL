  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and remain open to changing directions if something doesn\u2019t seem right. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nWe need to find \\( f(f(-2)) \\) for the function:\n\\[\nf(x) = x^{-1} + \\frac{x^{-1}}{1 + x^{-1}}\n\\]\n  \nAt first glance, this involves evaluating the function twice:  \n1. Compute \\( f(-2) \\).  \n2. Use that result to find \\( f(f(-2)) \\).\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**  \n- **Direct Substitution:** Plug \\(-2\\) into \\( f(x) \\) to find \\( f(-2) \\), then use that result as the input for the second evaluation.  \n- **Look for Simplifications:** Maybe the function can be simplified to make calculations easier.  \n- **Check Function Behavior:** Understanding how the function behaves for negative inputs might help anticipate the results.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems like a straightforward nested evaluation problem. I'll start by computing \\( f(-2) \\) and see where that leads. If complications arise, I can reconsider my approach.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Computing \\( f(-2) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's plug \\( x = -2 \\) into the function \\( f(x) \\).\n\n\\[\nf(-2) = (-2)^{-1} + \\frac{(-2)^{-1}}{1 + (-2)^{-1}}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\n1. **Compute \\( (-2)^{-1} \\):**  \n   \\[\n   (-2)^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Quick Check:**  \n   Does \\( (-2)^{-1} \\) equal \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\)? Yes, because the reciprocal of \\(-2\\) is \\(-0.5\\).\n\n2. **Substitute Back into the Function:**  \n   \\[\n   f(-2) = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   So far, so good. Next, I need to simplify the denominator.\n\n3. **Simplify the Denominator:**  \n   \\[\n   1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Verification:**  \n   Is \\( 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \\)? Yes.\n\n4. **Simplify the Fraction:**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = -1\n   \\]\n   \n   **Quick Check:**  \n   Dividing \\(-0.5\\) by \\(0.5\\) gives \\(-1\\). Correct.\n\n5. **Final Computation:**  \n   \\[\n   f(-2) = -\\frac{1}{2} + (-1) = -\\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Let me double-check that addition:  \n   \\(-\\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\\frac{3}{2}\\). Yep, that seems right.\n\n**Outcome:**  \n\\[\nf(-2) = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Verification:**  \nGiven the function and the input, \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) as an output makes sense. No errors so far.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Computing \\( f(f(-2)) = f\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to evaluate \\( f(x) \\) at \\( x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\). Let's plug this value into the function.\n\n\\[\nf\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{-1} + \\frac{\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{-1}}{1 + \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{-1}}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\n1. **Compute \\( \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{-1} \\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{-1} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Quick Check:**  \n   The reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) is \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\). Correct.\n\n2. **Substitute Back into the Function:**  \n   \\[\n   f\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{-\\frac{2}{3}}{1 - \\frac{2}{3}}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Now, I need to simplify the denominator again.\n\n3. **Simplify the Denominator:**  \n   \\[\n   1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Verification:**  \n   Is \\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\)? Yes, because \\( 1 - 0.666... = 0.333... \\).\n\n4. **Simplify the Fraction:**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{-\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = -2\n   \\]\n   \n   **Quick Check:**  \n   Dividing \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) yields \\(-2\\). Correct.\n\n5. **Final Computation:**  \n   \\[\n   f\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{2}{3} + (-2) = -\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{6}{3} = -\\frac{8}{3}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Does adding \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\) and \\(-2\\) result in \\(-\\frac{8}{3}\\)?  \n   Let's see:  \n   \\(-\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{6}{3} = -\\frac{8}{3}\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\n**Outcome:**  \n\\[\nf(f(-2)) = -\\frac{8}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Verification:**  \nThe computations align correctly. No discrepancies found.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing the answer, it's essential to ensure that the method was correct. Let's review each step to confirm that the function was applied properly both times.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Checking Each Calculation Step:** Were all exponents and fractions handled correctly?  \n- **Considering Alternative Methods:** Is there a simplification or pattern that I might have missed to make the process easier?  \n- **Analyzing Function Behavior:** Does the function behave consistently with the results obtained?\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Inverse Calculations:** Both \\((-2)^{-1}\\) and \\(\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{-1}\\) were computed accurately.  \n- **Fraction Simplification:** The fractions were simplified correctly at each step.  \n- **Final Addition/Subtraction:** The final results were verified through straightforward arithmetic checks.\n\n**Verification:**  \nEverything checks out. Each calculation step is correct, and the method aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nNo errors detected. The approach is valid, and the final answer is reliable.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAfter carefully evaluating \\( f(-2) \\) and then \\( f(f(-2)) \\), and verifying each step, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\frac{8}{3}}\n\\]\n\n**<ANSWER>**  \n\\boxed{-\\frac{8}{3}}  \n**</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy systematically approaching this problem:\n\n1. **Initial Brainstorming:**  \n   Identifying the need to compute \\( f(-2) \\) first and then use its result for the second evaluation.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**  \n   Carefully performing each calculation with frequent checks to ensure correctness.\n\n3. **Reflective Verification:**  \n   Continuously reflecting on each step's validity and making quick sanity checks to confirm the results.\n\n4. **Final Review:**  \n   Thoroughly reviewing the entire process to ensure that no errors were made and that the method was appropriate.\n\nIf at any point an inconsistency was found, I was prepared to revisit the steps, identify where the mistake occurred, and correct it. This methodical approach is crucial in problem-solving, especially when dealing with nested functions or more complex mathematical operations. It ensures accuracy and reliability in arriving at the final answer.\n\n---\n\n**<SUMMARY>**  \nBy following a structured approach\u2014starting with understanding the problem, proceeding with careful calculations, continuously verifying each step, and concluding with a final review\u2014I successfully determined that \\( f(f(-2)) = -\\frac{8}{3} \\).

  "ground_truth": "We have  \\[f(x) = x^{-1} + \\frac{x^{-1}}{1+x^{-1}} = \\frac1x + \\frac{1/x}{1+\\frac{1}{x}}.\\] Therefore, we have  \\begin{align*}f(-2) &= \\frac{1}{-2} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{-2}}{1 + \\frac{1}{-2}} \\\\&= -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{-1/2}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} \\\\&= -\\frac12 + \\frac{-1/2}{1/2} \\\\&= -\\frac12-1 = -\\frac{3}{2}.\\end{align*} So, we have \\begin{align*}\nf(f(-2)) = f(-3/2) &= \\frac{1}{-3/2} + \\frac{1/(-3/2)}{1 + \\frac{1}{-3/2}} \\\\\n&= -\\frac23 + \\frac{-2/3}{1 -\\frac23} = -\\frac23 + \\frac{-2/3}{1/3}\\\\\n&= -\\frac23 - 2 = \\boxed{-\\frac83}.\\end{align*}"
