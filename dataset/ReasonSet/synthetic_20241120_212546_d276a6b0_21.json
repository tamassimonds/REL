    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem together, thinking it through just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect at each step, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with base-6 numbers involving distinct digits less than 6. The equations given are:\n\n1. \\( AB_6 + C_6 = C0_6 \\)\n2. \\( AB_6 + BA_6 = CC_6 \\)\n\nWe need to find the three-digit number \\( ABC_6 \\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nAt first glance, this looks like a problem involving base conversion and system of equations. I remember handling similar problems by converting base-6 numbers to base-10 to simplify calculations.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Convert to Base-10:** Transform all base-6 numbers to base-10 to work with familiar arithmetic.\n2. **Set Up Equations:** Create equations for each given condition and solve them simultaneously.\n3. **Trial and Error:** Since digits are limited (less than 6), maybe trying different combinations could work.\n\nI think converting to base-10 seems like a solid starting point. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Converting Base-6 Numbers to Base-10**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI'll convert each base-6 number into base-10 to make the equations easier to handle.\n\n- \\( AB_6 \\): This is \\( A \\times 6 + B \\) in base-10.\n- \\( C_6 \\): This is just \\( C \\) since it's a single digit.\n- \\( C0_6 \\): This is \\( C \\times 6 + 0 = 6C \\) in base-10.\n- \\( BA_6 \\): This is \\( B \\times 6 + A \\) in base-10.\n- \\( CC_6 \\): This is \\( C \\times 6 + C = 7C \\) in base-10.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, let me double-check that. Yeah, \\( C0_6 \\) is indeed \\( 6C \\) because multiplying by the base shifts the digit over. Similarly, \\( CC_6 = 7C \\) makes sense since it's \\( C \\times 6 + C \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nConversion seems correct. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Writing the Equations in Base-10**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I'll rewrite the given equations using the base-10 conversions.\n\n1. \\( (A \\times 6 + B) + C = 6C \\)\n2. \\( (A \\times 6 + B) + (B \\times 6 + A) = 7C \\)\n\n**Simplifying Equation 1:**  \nLet's rearrange and simplify the first equation.\n\n\\[\nA \\times 6 + B + C = 6C \\\\\nA \\times 6 + B = 6C - C \\\\\nA \\times 6 + B = 5C \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Equation 2:**  \nNow, let's tackle the second equation.\n\n\\[\n(A \\times 6 + B) + (B \\times 6 + A) = 7C \\\\\n6A + B + 6B + A = 7C \\\\\n7A + 7B = 7C \\\\\nA + B = C \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, Equation 2 simplifies nicely to \\( A + B = C \\). That seems straightforward. Equation 1 relates \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) via multiplication and addition. So far, so good.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWith two equations:\n\n1. \\( A \\times 6 + B = 5C \\)\n2. \\( A + B = C \\)\n\nI can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1 to eliminate \\( C \\).\n\n**Substitution:**  \nLet's replace \\( C \\) in Equation 1 with \\( A + B \\) from Equation 2.\n\n\\[\nA \\times 6 + B = 5(A + B) \\\\\n6A + B = 5A + 5B\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**  \nSubtract \\( 5A \\) and \\( B \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n6A - 5A + B - B = 5B - B \\\\\nA = 4B\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWait a second, \\( A = 4B \\) is a strong relationship. Given that \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) are distinct digits less than 6, this limits our options significantly.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIs this relationship valid considering the constraints? Let\u2019s check.\n\n- If \\( A = 4B \\) and both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are digits less than 6:\n  - \\( B = 1 \\) \u21d2 \\( A = 4 \\times 1 = 4 \\)\n  - \\( B = 2 \\) \u21d2 \\( A = 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\) (Invalid since \\( A \\) must be less than 6)\n  - \\( B = 3 \\) \u21d2 \\( A = 12 \\) (Invalid)\n  - Higher \\( B \\) values make \\( A \\) even larger and invalid.\n\n**Realization:**  \nOnly \\( B = 1 \\) and \\( A = 4 \\) satisfy \\( A = 4B \\) within the digit constraints.\n\n**Check Distinctness:**  \nBut \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) must be distinct, which they are here (4 and 1). However, \\( C = A + B = 5 \\), which is distinct from both.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLooks like \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 1 \\), \\( C = 5 \\) is a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAlways good to verify the solution by plugging the values back into the original equations.\n\n- Given: \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 1 \\), \\( C = 5 \\)\n\n**Checking Equation 1:**\n\\[\nAB_6 + C_6 = C0_6 \\\\\n41_6 + 5_6 = 50_6\n\\]\n- Convert to base-10:\n  - \\( 41_6 = 4 \\times 6 + 1 = 25 \\)\n  - \\( 5_6 = 5 \\)\n  - \\( 50_6 = 5 \\times 6 + 0 = 30 \\)\n- Check:\n  \\[\n  25 + 5 = 30 \\quad (\\text{True})\n  \\]\n\n**Checking Equation 2:**\n\\[\nAB_6 + BA_6 = CC_6 \\\\\n41_6 + 14_6 = 55_6\n\\]\n- Convert to base-10:\n  - \\( 41_6 = 25 \\)\n  - \\( 14_6 = 1 \\times 6 + 4 = 10 \\)\n  - \\( 55_6 = 5 \\times 6 + 5 = 35 \\)\n- Check:\n  \\[\n  25 + 10 = 35 \\quad (\\text{True})\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth equations hold true with \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 1 \\), and \\( C = 5 \\). The solution seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe three-digit number \\( ABC_6 \\) is \\( 415_6 \\).\n\n**Verification Summary:**  \nAll steps checked out, and the solution satisfies both original equations. The conversion to base-10 helped simplify the problem, and substituting one equation into another led us directly to the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Brainstorming Paid Off:** Starting with base conversion made the algebra straightforward.\n- **Checking Constraints:** Ensuring digits were distinct and within range was crucial.\n- **Verification Step:** Plugging back the values confirmed the correctness of the solution.\n\nI initially considered trial and error but realized that the systematic approach of converting bases and solving equations was more efficient. Always good to explore different strategies and choose the one that provides clarity and accuracy.",
