Just like tackling a problem in real life, I'll brainstorm, reflect, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question, it asks for the number of distinct ordered pairs of positive integers \\((m, n)\\) such that the sum of their reciprocals equals \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Familiar Concept:** This reminds me of problems involving finding integer solutions for equations with reciprocals. I vaguely recall dealing with similar equations before.\n- **Possible Strategies:** I could try manipulating the equation algebraically, maybe find a common denominator or cross-multiply. Alternatively, consider listing possible values for \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n1. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Attempt to combine the fractions and simplify to find a relationship between \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n2. **Trial and Error with Small Integers:** Start by plugging in small integer values to see if they satisfy the equation.\n3. **Factoring Approach:** Look for a way to factor the equation after manipulation to find integer solutions.\n\nLet me begin with **Algebraic Manipulation** since it's a systematic approach that lays a foundation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Algebraic Manipulation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I want to find an equation that relates \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) directly.\n- The given condition is \\(\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n  \n**Starting Point:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Common Denominator:**\n- The common denominator for the left side is \\(mn\\).\n- Rewrite the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n + m}{mn} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Cross-Multiplying:**\n\\[\n4(n + m) = mn\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging the Equation:**\n\\[\nmn - 4m - 4n = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This looks like a quadratic equation in terms of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n- Maybe I can factor it or use the quadratic formula to find integer solutions.\n\n**Check:**\n- At this stage, the equation seems set up for factoring or applying the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting to Factor the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I want to see if this quadratic equation can be factored into a product of binomials.\n- The standard form is \\(mn - 4m - 4n = 0\\).\n\n**Factoring Attempt:**\n- Rearrange to make it clearer:\n\n\\[\nmn - 4m - 4n = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad mn - 4m - 4n + 16 = 16\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(m - 4)(n - 4) = 16\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, this looks promising! By adding 16 to both sides, the equation factors nicely.\n- Now, \\((m - 4)(n - 4) = 16\\) suggests that \\(m - 4\\) and \\(n - 4\\) are integer factors of 16.\n\n**Check:**\n- Let me briefly verify: Multiplying out \\((m - 4)(n - 4)\\) gives \\(mn - 4m - 4n + 16\\), which matches our rearranged equation.\n\n- **Quick Verification:** Does this make sense? Yes, because if \\(m - 4\\) and \\(n - 4\\) are factors of 16, then when multiplied, they satisfy the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Integer Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, I need to find all pairs \\((m - 4, n - 4)\\) that are integer factors of 16.\n- Since \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are positive integers, \\(m - 4\\) and \\(n - 4\\) must be non-negative integers.\n\n**Factoring 16:**\n- The positive integer factors of 16 are: \\(1, 2, 4, 8, 16\\).\n  \n**Generating Solutions:**\n- Each pair of factors \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x \\times y = 16\\) corresponds to \\((m, n)\\) where:\n  \n  \\[\n  m = x + 4, \\quad n = y + 4\n  \\]\n\n- **Positive Factor Pairs:**\n  - \\( (1, 16) \\)\n  - \\( (2, 8) \\)\n  - \\( (4, 4) \\)\n  \n  (Since \\( (x, y) \\) and \\( (y, x) \\) are distinct ordered pairs unless \\(x = y\\))\n\n**Calculating \\((m, n)\\) for Each Pair:**\n1. **First Pair: \\((1, 16)\\)**\n   - \\(m - 4 = 1 \\implies m = 5\\)\n   - \\(n - 4 = 16 \\implies n = 20\\)\n   - Ordered Pair: \\((5, 20)\\)\n   \n2. **Second Pair: \\((2, 8)\\)**\n   - \\(m - 4 = 2 \\implies m = 6\\)\n   - \\(n - 4 = 8 \\implies n = 12\\)\n   - Ordered Pair: \\((6, 12)\\)\n   \n3. **Third Pair: \\((4, 4)\\)**\n   - \\(m - 4 = 4 \\implies m = 8\\)\n   - \\(n - 4 = 4 \\implies n = 8\\)\n   - Ordered Pair: \\((8, 8)\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So far, I've identified three distinct ordered pairs: \\((5, 20)\\), \\((6, 12)\\), and \\((8, 8)\\).\n- Wait, but the problem asks for distinct ordered pairs. I should consider both \\((m, n)\\) and \\((n, m)\\) unless \\(m = n\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- **Ordered Pairs Distinction:** \n  - \\((5, 20)\\) and \\((20, 5)\\) are distinct.\n  - \\((6, 12)\\) and \\((12, 6)\\) are distinct.\n  - \\((8, 8)\\) is symmetric, so only counts once.\n\n- **Total Distinct Ordered Pairs:**\n  - \\((5, 20)\\), \\((20, 5)\\)\n  - \\((6, 12)\\), \\((12, 6)\\)\n  - \\((8, 8)\\)\n\n  **Total:** 5 distinct ordered pairs.\n\n- **Quick Verification:** \n  - Does this make sense? Yes, because each factor pair corresponds to two ordered pairs except when \\(m = n\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Confirming the Total Number of Distinct Ordered Pairs**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I've identified five distinct ordered pairs. Let's ensure there's no overcounting and that all possible pairs are considered.\n\n**Re-examining Factor Pairs:**\n- From \\((m - 4)(n - 4) = 16\\), the positive integer solutions are based on the factors of 16.\n- Each positive factor pair yields two ordered pairs, except when both factors are equal.\n\n**Ensuring Distinctness:**\n- **Factor Set:** \\( (1, 16), (2, 8), (4, 4) \\)\n- **Corresponding \\((m, n)\\) Pairs:**\n  - \\( (5, 20), (20, 5) \\)\n  - \\( (6, 12), (12, 6) \\)\n  - \\( (8, 8) \\)\n\n**Total Count:**\n- **Distinct Ordered Pairs:**\n  - \\((5, 20)\\)\n  - \\((20, 5)\\)\n  - \\((6, 12)\\)\n  - \\((12, 6)\\)\n  - \\((8, 8)\\)\n\n- **Total:** 5\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Everything checks out. No overcounting since \\((m, n)\\) and \\((n, m)\\) are considered distinct unless \\(m = n\\).\n- The pairs \\((5, 20)\\) and \\((20, 5)\\) are distinct, as are \\((6, 12)\\) and \\((12, 6)\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Does the total make sense? Yes, combining the symmetrical pairs and accounting for \\((8, 8)\\) only once aligns with the factor pairs of 16.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Concluding the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- After exploring different strategies, confirming each step, and ensuring all distinct ordered pairs are accounted for, I can confidently state the answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- **Number of Distinct Ordered Pairs:** **5**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- By starting with algebraic manipulation, attempting to factor the equation, and carefully identifying all distinct ordered pairs from the factorization, I've arrived at a well-verified solution.\n- Throughout the process, checking and re-checking ensured accuracy, and being open to adjusting the approach helped catch and correct potential missteps early on.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **Does it Align with the Problem Statement?** Yes, the total number of distinct ordered pairs is consistent with the requirement that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are positive integers whose reciprocals sum to \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n- **Is the Answer Reasonable?** Given the factors of 16 and the symmetry in ordered pairs, a total of 5 distinct pairs seems logical and achievable.",

  "ground_truth": "As an equation, $\\frac 1m + \\frac 1n = \\frac 14$. Multiplying both sides by $4mn$ to clear out the denominators gives $4n + 4m = mn$. Re-arranging and applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, it follows that  $$mn - 4m - 4n + 16 = (m-4)(n-4) = 16.$$Thus, $m-4$ and $n-4$ are pairs of factors of $16$; to satisfy the positive condition, both factors must also be positive. Then, $$(m-4,n-4) = (1,16),(2,8),(4,4),(8,2),(16,1),$$yielding $\\boxed{5}$ distinct ordered pairs."
