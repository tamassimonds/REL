    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, thinking out loud and exploring different strategies along the way. I'll brainstorm, reflect, and check my work frequently, just like I would naturally when tackling a problem.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\( y = \\frac{x}{x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C} \\), I notice it's a rational function with a cubic polynomial in the denominator. Rational functions often have vertical and horizontal asymptotes, which can help identify the constants \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Identify Asymptotes:** I remember that the denominators of rational functions determine vertical asymptotes where the function is undefined. Maybe the locations of these asymptotes can help me figure out \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\).\n\n2. **Horizontal Asymptotes:** The behavior of the function as \\( x \\) approaches infinity might provide additional clues about the leading coefficients in the numerator and denominator.\n\n3. **Factoring the Denominator:** If I can factor the denominator, that might directly reveal the roots corresponding to the vertical asymptotes.\n\n4. **Matching the Given Graph:** Since there's a graph provided, I can use its features (like intercepts, asymptotes, and possible holes) to verify my findings.\n\n5. **Polynomial Long Division:** If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, there might be a horizontal asymptote, which could relate to the coefficients.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet me start by identifying the vertical asymptotes, as they are directly related to the roots of the denominator. If I can find the roots, I might be able to connect them to \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\).\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying Vertical Asymptotes**\n\nLooking at the given graph, I notice there are vertical asymptotes at \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nVertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero (and the numerator is non-zero). So, the roots of the denominator \\( x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \\) should be \\( x = -2, 1, \\) and \\( 2 \\).\n\n**Equation Setup:**  \nIf the denominator has roots at \\( x = -2, 1, \\) and \\( 2 \\), I can express it as:\n\\[\nx^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C = (x + 2)(x - 1)(x - 2)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense because if the denominator factors into \\( (x + 2)(x - 1)(x - 2) \\), then the vertical asymptotes are exactly at \\( x = -2, 1, \\) and \\( 2 \\). This aligns with what I see in the graph.\n\n**Next Step:**  \nNow, I need to expand \\( (x + 2)(x - 1)(x - 2) \\) to find the coefficients \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\).\n\n### **Step 2: Expanding the Denominator**\n\nLet's expand \\( (x + 2)(x - 1)(x - 2) \\) step by step.\n\n**First, Multiply \\( (x - 1)(x - 2) \\):**\n\\[\n(x - 1)(x - 2) = x^2 - 2x - x + 2 = x^2 - 3x + 2\n\\]\n\n**Next, Multiply \\( (x + 2)(x^2 - 3x + 2) \\):**\n\\[\n(x + 2)(x^2 - 3x + 2) = x \\cdot x^2 - 3x \\cdot x + 2x + 2 \\cdot x^2 - 6x + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n= x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 2x^2 - 6x + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n= x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the expanded denominator is \\( x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4 \\). This gives me:\n\\[\nA = -1, \\quad B = -4, \\quad C = 4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me quickly verify if this makes sense. The factored form was \\( (x + 2)(x - 1)(x - 2) \\), which should have vertical asymptotes at \\( x = -2, 1, \\) and \\( 2 \\). Expanding it gives the correct polynomial, so \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) seem correct.\n\n**Next Step:**  \nNow that I have \\( A = -1, B = -4, C = 4 \\), I can find \\( A + B + C \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\( A + B + C \\)**\n\n\\[\nA + B + C = -1 + (-4) + 4 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**  \nLet me double-check the calculation:\n\\[\n-1 + (-4) = -5\n\\]\n\\[\n-5 + 4 = -1\n\\]\nYes, the calculation is correct.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nAt first, I wasn't sure how to connect the vertical asymptotes to the coefficients \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\). After brainstorming different strategies, I realized that factoring the denominator based on the vertical asymptotes made the most sense. Expanding the factored form gave me the coefficients directly. Throughout, I checked each step to ensure consistency with the graph's features.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe value of \\( A + B + C \\) is **-1**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{-1}\\)\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBy approaching the problem methodically\u2014starting with identifying key features from the graph, factoring the denominator, and expanding it\u2014I was able to determine the coefficients and their sum accurately. Checking each step ensured that the solution aligned with the graph's characteristics, confirming the correctness of the final answer.",
