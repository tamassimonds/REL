  "solution": "Certainly! Let's craft a coherent solution while maintaining the original thought process. I'll ensure it flows naturally from brainstorming to the final answer, reflecting the journey of solving the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling it on paper\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nWe have a recursive sequence defined as follows:\n\n- \\( a_{10} = 10 \\)\n- For \\( n > 10 \\), \\( a_n = 100a_{n-1} + n \\)\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest \\( n > 10 \\) such that \\( a_n \\) is a multiple of 99, i.e., \\( a_n \\equiv 0 \\mod 99 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Brainstorming**\n\nHmm, this looks like a classic recursive sequence problem. A few ideas come to mind:\n\n1. **Compute Terms Manually:** I could calculate the next few terms to see if \\( a_n \\) becomes a multiple of 99.\n2. **Look for a Pattern or Closed Formula:** Maybe there's a way to express \\( a_n \\) in terms of \\( n \\) to make it easier to check divisibility by 99.\n3. **Use Modular Arithmetic:** Since we're dealing with multiples of 99, congruences might simplify the problem.\n\nLet's explore these ideas one by one and see which works best.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Compute Terms Manually**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nStarting simple\u2014let's calculate the next few terms to see if \\( a_n \\) is divisible by 99. This straightforward approach might reveal a pattern.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nLet's compute \\( a_{11} \\) and \\( a_{12} \\) to start:\n\n\\[\na_{11} = 100 \\times a_{10} + 11 = 100 \\times 10 + 11 = 1000 + 11 = 1011\n\\]\n\n\\[\na_{12} = 100 \\times a_{11} + 12 = 100 \\times 1011 + 12 = 101100 + 12 = 101112\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute\u2014these numbers are getting large quickly. Checking divisibility by 99 manually isn't practical. I need a better strategy.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nManual computation isn't the best approach here. Let's try something else.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Look for a Pattern or Closed Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nPerhaps there's a way to express \\( a_n \\) in a closed form. If I can find a general expression, analyzing its divisibility by 99 might be easier.\n\n**Exploration:**  \nNotice that each term is built by multiplying the previous term by 100 and adding \\( n \\). This reminds me of geometric series, but the addition of \\( n \\) complicates things.\n\n**Attempt:**  \nLet's try to express \\( a_n \\) in terms of \\( a_{10} \\) and the subsequent \\( n \\)'s.\n\nStarting from \\( a_{11} \\):\n\n\\[\na_{11} = 100a_{10} + 11\n\\]\n\n\\[\na_{12} = 100a_{11} + 12 = 100(100a_{10} + 11) + 12 = 100^2a_{10} + 100 \\times 11 + 12\n\\]\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\n\\[\na_{13} = 100a_{12} + 13 = 100^3a_{10} + 100^2 \\times 11 + 100 \\times 12 + 13\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI see a pattern forming: each term is a sum of multiples of 100 raised to various powers. However, this approach looks messy and might not lead to a clear solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIt might be possible to generalize this, but it's not straightforward. I need a more systematic way to derive a closed formula. Let's move on to another strategy.\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Use Modular Arithmetic to Simplify**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince we're interested in \\( a_n \\) being a multiple of 99, let's work modulo 99. This could simplify the recurrence relation and make computations manageable.\n\n**Exploration:**  \nGiven \\( a_n = 100a_{n-1} + n \\), let's take both sides modulo 99:\n\n\\[\na_n \\equiv 100a_{n-1} + n \\mod 99\n\\]\n\nBut \\( 100 \\equiv 1 \\mod 99 \\) (since 100 - 99 = 1), so the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\na_n \\equiv a_{n-1} + n \\mod 99\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis simplification is helpful! It turns the recurrence into a simple addition modulo 99. Now I can compute \\( a_n \\mod 99 \\) without dealing with large numbers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis seems promising. Let's proceed with this approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementing the Modular Arithmetic Strategy**\n\nLet's start by computing \\( a_n \\mod 99 \\) for \\( n > 10 \\) until we find \\( a_n \\equiv 0 \\mod 99 \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n- **Start with \\( a_{10} = 10 \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  a_{10} \\equiv 10 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n- **Compute \\( a_{11} \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  a_{11} \\equiv a_{10} + 11 \\equiv 10 + 11 \\equiv 21 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n- **Next, \\( a_{12} \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  a_{12} \\equiv a_{11} + 12 \\equiv 21 + 12 \\equiv 33 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n- **Continue this process:**\n\n  \\[\n  a_{13} \\equiv a_{12} + 13 \\equiv 33 + 13 \\equiv 46 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{14} \\equiv a_{13} + 14 \\equiv 46 + 14 \\equiv 60 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{15} \\equiv a_{14} + 15 \\equiv 60 + 15 \\equiv 75 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{16} \\equiv a_{15} + 16 \\equiv 75 + 16 \\equiv 91 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{17} \\equiv a_{16} + 17 \\equiv 91 + 17 \\equiv 108 \\equiv 9 \\mod 99 \\quad (\\text{since } 108 - 99 = 9)\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{18} \\equiv a_{17} + 18 \\equiv 9 + 18 \\equiv 27 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{19} \\equiv a_{18} + 19 \\equiv 27 + 19 \\equiv 46 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{20} \\equiv a_{19} + 20 \\equiv 46 + 20 \\equiv 66 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{21} \\equiv a_{20} + 21 \\equiv 66 + 21 \\equiv 87 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{22} \\equiv a_{21} + 22 \\equiv 87 + 22 \\equiv 109 \\equiv 10 \\mod 99 \\quad (\\text{since } 109 - 99 = 10)\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{23} \\equiv a_{22} + 23 \\equiv 10 + 23 \\equiv 33 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{24} \\equiv a_{23} + 24 \\equiv 33 + 24 \\equiv 57 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{25} \\equiv a_{24} + 25 \\equiv 57 + 25 \\equiv 82 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{26} \\equiv a_{25} + 26 \\equiv 82 + 26 \\equiv 108 \\equiv 9 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{27} \\equiv a_{26} + 27 \\equiv 9 + 27 \\equiv 36 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{28} \\equiv a_{27} + 28 \\equiv 36 + 28 \\equiv 64 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{29} \\equiv a_{28} + 29 \\equiv 64 + 29 \\equiv 93 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{30} \\equiv a_{29} + 30 \\equiv 93 + 30 \\equiv 123 \\equiv 24 \\mod 99 \\quad (\\text{since } 123 - 99 = 24)\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{31} \\equiv a_{30} + 31 \\equiv 24 + 31 \\equiv 55 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{32} \\equiv a_{31} + 32 \\equiv 55 + 32 \\equiv 87 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{33} \\equiv a_{32} + 33 \\equiv 87 + 33 \\equiv 120 \\equiv 21 \\mod 99 \\quad (\\text{since } 120 - 99 = 21)\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{34} \\equiv a_{33} + 34 \\equiv 21 + 34 \\equiv 55 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{35} \\equiv a_{34} + 35 \\equiv 55 + 35 \\equiv 90 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{36} \\equiv a_{35} + 36 \\equiv 90 + 36 \\equiv 126 \\equiv 27 \\mod 99 \\quad (\\text{since } 126 - 99 = 27)\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{37} \\equiv a_{36} + 37 \\equiv 27 + 37 \\equiv 64 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{38} \\equiv a_{37} + 38 \\equiv 64 + 38 \\equiv 102 \\equiv 3 \\mod 99 \\quad (\\text{since } 102 - 99 = 3)\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{39} \\equiv a_{38} + 39 \\equiv 3 + 39 \\equiv 42 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{40} \\equiv a_{39} + 40 \\equiv 42 + 40 \\equiv 82 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{41} \\equiv a_{40} + 41 \\equiv 82 + 41 \\equiv 123 \\equiv 24 \\mod 99 \\quad (\\text{since } 123 - 99 = 24)\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{42} \\equiv a_{41} + 42 \\equiv 24 + 42 \\equiv 66 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{43} \\equiv a_{42} + 43 \\equiv 66 + 43 \\equiv 109 \\equiv 10 \\mod 99 \\quad (\\text{since } 109 - 99 = 10)\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{44} \\equiv a_{43} + 44 \\equiv 10 + 44 \\equiv 54 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a_{45} \\equiv a_{44} + 45 \\equiv 54 + 45 \\equiv 99 \\equiv 0 \\mod 99\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**Aha moment!** It seems that \\( a_{45} \\equiv 0 \\mod 99 \\).

  "ground_truth": "Writing out the recursive statement for $a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_{10}$ and summing them gives\\[a_n+\\dots+a_{10}=100(a_{n-1}+\\dots+a_{10})+n+\\dots+10\\]Which simplifies to\\[a_n=99(a_{n-1}+\\dots+a_{10})+\\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)\\]Therefore, $a_n$ is divisible by 99 if and only if $\\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)$ is divisible by 99, so $(n+10)(n-9)$ needs to be divisible by 9 and 11. Assume that $n+10$ is a multiple of 11. Writing out a few terms, $n=12, 23, 34, 45$, we see that $n=45$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case. Next, assume that $n-9$ is a multiple of 11. Writing out a few terms, $n=20, 31, 42, 53$, we see that $n=53$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case. The smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{45}$.\nNote that we can also construct the solution using CRT by assuming either $11$ divides $n+10$ and $9$ divides $n-9$, or $9$ divides $n+10$ and $11$ divides $n-9$, and taking the smaller solution."
