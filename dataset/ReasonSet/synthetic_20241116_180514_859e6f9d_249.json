I recognize that it's a **quartic equation** (fourth degree), which typically hints at either factoring, using synthetic division, or applying the **Rational Root Theorem**. However, I notice that the left-hand side resembles a binomial expansion, specifically the expansion of \\( (x - 1)^4 \\).\n\nI also see that the equation sets a polynomial equal to a constant, which reminds me of finding roots by setting the equation to zero. To find nonreal roots, I recall that quartic equations can have up to four roots, and nonreal roots often come in conjugate pairs (if the coefficients are real).\n\n**First thoughts:**\n- **Option 1:** Try to recognize a pattern like the binomial expansion.\n- **Option 2:** Isolate the polynomial on one side and apply the Rational Root Theorem.\n- **Option 3:** Consider substituting or transforming the equation to simplify it.\n\nAt this point, the binomial expansion possibility stands out because of the familiar structure in the equation. Let me explore that first.\n\n### **Step 1: Recognizing Binomial Expansion**\n\nI recall that the binomial expansion of \\( (x - 1)^4 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1\n\\]\n\nComparing this with the given equation:\n\n\\[\nx^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x = 2005\n\\]\n\nI notice that the only difference is the constant term, which is \\( +1 \\) in the binomial expansion and \\( = 2005 \\) in the given equation. This suggests that:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)^4 - 1 = 2005\n\\]\n\n**Thought process:** This transformation simplifies the equation by recognizing a familiar pattern. It makes me think that perhaps the equation can be rewritten in terms of \\( (x - 1)^4 \\), which might make solving for \\( x \\) easier.\n\n### **Step 2: Rewriting the Equation**\n\nLet's rewrite the original equation using the binomial expansion insight:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)^4 - 1 = 2005\n\\]\n\nAdding 1 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)^4 = 2006\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This looks cleaner and more straightforward. Now, I can take the fourth root of both sides to solve for \\( x - 1 \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Taking the Fourth Root**\n\nTo solve for \\( x - 1 \\), I take the fourth root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nx - 1 = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{2006}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two sets of solutions:\n\n\\[\nx - 1 = \\sqrt[4]{2006} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 1 = -\\sqrt[4]{2006}\n\\]\n\nAdding 1 to both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = 1 \\pm \\sqrt[4]{2006}\n\\]\n\n**Thought process:** At this point, I have four potential solutions:\n\n1. \\( x = 1 + \\sqrt[4]{2006} \\)\n2. \\( x = 1 - \\sqrt[4]{2006} \\)\n3. \\( x = 1 + i\\sqrt[4]{2006} \\) (imaginary part)\n4. \\( x = 1 - i\\sqrt[4]{2006} \\) (imaginary part)\n\nI realize that the last two solutions involve imaginary numbers, which aligns with the question asking for the **nonreal roots**. So, the nonreal roots are:\n\n\\[\nx = 1 \\pm i\\sqrt[4]{2006}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Wait, let me quickly verify if these roots make sense. The original equation is a quartic, which can have up to four roots. I've identified four roots total, with two being nonreal, which fits the expectation. Also, taking the fourth root of a positive number (\\( 2006 \\)) naturally leads to imaginary solutions when considering negative roots.\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Product of the Nonreal Roots**\n\nNow that I have the nonreal roots:\n\n\\[\nx_1 = 1 + i\\sqrt[4]{2006} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_2 = 1 - i\\sqrt[4]{2006}\n\\]\n\nI need to find the product \\( x_1 \\times x_2 \\).\n\n**Thought process:** The product of two conjugate pairs is usually straightforward. In this case, multiplying the roots directly should work. Let's calculate it step-by-step.\n\nMultiplying:\n\n\\[\nx_1 \\times x_2 = (1 + i\\sqrt[4]{2006}) \\times (1 - i\\sqrt[4]{2006})\n\\]\n\nUsing the difference of squares formula:\n\n\\[\n= (1)^2 - (i\\sqrt[4]{2006})^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n\\[\n= 1 - (i^2)(\\sqrt[4]{2006})^2\n\\]\n\nSince \\( i^2 = -1 \\):\n\n\\[\n= 1 - (-1)(\\sqrt{2006})\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 + \\sqrt{2006}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** The product of the nonreal roots gives a real number, which makes sense because the product of complex conjugates always results in a real number when multiplied. This aligns with expectations.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Check and Verification**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let me quickly check:\n\n- **Number of roots:** Quartic equation \u2192 4 roots identified \u2192 2 nonreal roots \u2192 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Product calculation:** \\( (1 + i\\sqrt[4]{2006}) \\times (1 - i\\sqrt[4]{2006}) = 1 + \\sqrt{2006} \\) \u2192 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Real part of the product:** \\( 1 + \\sqrt{2006} \\) is a valid real number \u2192 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. The approach seems correct, and the calculations lead to a reasonable and expected result.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe product of the nonreal roots of the equation \\( x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x = 2005 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1 + \\sqrt{2006}}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Initially, recognizing the binomial expansion was key to simplifying the problem. By rewriting the equation in terms of \\( (x - 1)^4 \\), I could easily find the roots, including the nonreal ones. Checking each step along the way ensured that the approach was correct and that the final answer was accurate.",
