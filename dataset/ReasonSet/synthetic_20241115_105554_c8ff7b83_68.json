    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore where I'm going wrong, and check my work along the way\u2014just like I would if I were tackling this problem myself.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nSo, we're dealing with a population of *Helianthus annus* (sunflowers) that aren't in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The focus is on a gene locus P with alleles P1 and P2. Here's what stands out:\n\n1. **Alleles and Fitness:** P2 is a deleterious recessive allele causing reduced fitness in *P2P2* genotype carriers.\n2. **Mutations:** There's a mutation from P1 to P2, but no back mutation.\n3. **Favorability:** P1 is the favored allele.\n4. **Selection Coefficient (s):** 0.1\n5. **Mutation Rate (\u03bc):** 0.0001\n\nThe goal is to find:\n- The fitness of the P1 homozygote (*P1P1*), heterozygote (*P1P2*), and the equilibrium frequency of the favored allele (P1).\n\n**Options:**\n- (A) 1, 1, 0.97\n- (B) 1, 1, 0.1\n- (C) 1, 1, 0.03\n- (D) 1, 0.5, 0.97\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis problem seems related to population genetics concepts like **mutation-selection balance** and **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium**. It reminds me of how mutations and selection pressure can affect allele frequencies over time. But I'll need to think through it more to be sure.\n\n### **Step 1: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Approach:**  \n   Normally, this principle helps us understand allele frequencies under certain conditions (no selection, mutation, migration, etc.). But since the population isn't in HWE, I might need to adjust this principle.\n\n2. **Mutation-Selection Balance Model:**  \n   This model specifically addresses how mutation and selection pressure can reach an equilibrium, especially for deleterious alleles. This seems directly relevant since P2 is deleterious.\n\n3. **Calculating Fitness Values:**  \n   Determine the fitness of each genotype to see how they impact allele frequencies.\n\n**Wait a minute\u2014** Given that P1 is favored and P2 has reduced fitness, the mutation-selection balance model feels like the right direction. \n\n### **Reflection and Adjusting Strategy**\n\n**Is Hardy-Weinberg Enough?**  \nMaybe not directly, since the population isn't in HWE. But it could be a starting point for calculating equilibrium frequencies.\n\n**Keeping Mutation-Selection Balance in Mind:**  \nI think this model will help me understand how the mutation rate and selection coefficient interact to determine the equilibrium frequency of P1.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet's start with the Mutation-Selection Balance approach because it directly deals with the equilibrium between mutation introducing deleterious alleles and selection removing them.\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Mutation-Selection Balance Model**\n\n**Concept Reminder:**  \nThe mutation-selection balance model states that the equilibrium frequency of a deleterious allele is determined by the balance between its introduction by mutation and its removal by selection.\n\n**Key Variables:**\n- **\u03bc (Mutation Rate):** Rate at which P1 mutates to P2. Given as 0.0001.\n- **s (Selection Coefficient):** Fitness disadvantage of *P2P2* due to P2. Given as 0.1.\n\n**Formulas to Remember:**\n\n1. **Equilibrium Frequency of P2 (\\(q^*\\)):**\n   \\[ q^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{\u03bc}{s}} \\]\n   \n2. **Equilibrium Frequency of P1 (\\\\(p^*\\)):**\n   \\[ p^* = 1 - q^* \\]\n\n**Oh wait\u2014** Is this the right approach? Let me double-check. The formula for \\( q^* \\) indeed derives from balancing the mutation introducing P2 and selection removing it. So, I think we're on the right track.\n\n**Calculating \\( q^* \\):**\n\\[\nq^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0001}{0.1}} = \\sqrt{0.001} = 0.03162 (\\text{approx. } 0.03)\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{0.0001 / 0.1} = \\sqrt{0.001} = 0.03162\n\\]\nThis seems correct. \\( q^* \\) is approximately 0.03.\n\n**Finding \\( p^* \\):**\n\\[\np^* = 1 - q^* = 1 - 0.03 = 0.97\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n\\( p^* \\) is 0.97, which matches option (A) and (C).\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Fitness of Each Genotype**\n\n**Given:**  \n- **Fitness of *P2P2***:** Reduced by selection coefficient \\( s = 0.1 \\).\n- Since P2 is recessive, its effect is only seen in *P2P2* individuals.\n\n**Calculating Fitness:**\n1. **Fitness of *P1P1* (Homozygote for P1):**  \n   No deleterious allele, so fitness = 1 (maximum).\n\n2. **Fitness of *P1P2* (Heterozygote):**  \n   The recessive deleterious effect doesn't manifest, so fitness = 1.\n\n3. **Fitness of *P2P2* (Homozygote for P2):**  \n   Reduced by selection coefficient \\( s \\).  \n   \\[ \\text{Fitness} = 1 - s = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \\]\n\n**Hmm\u2014** That doesn't seem right because usually, recessive deleterious alleles can have full fitness reduction in homozygotes. But our \\( s \\) is 0.1, so the reduction is 10%. Let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe selection coefficient of 0.1 means that the fitness of *P2P2* is reduced by 10% compared to the baseline. Since P1 is the favored allele, *P2P2* individuals have lower fitness, but *P1P2* and *P1P1* have normal fitness.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Fitness of *P1P1*:** 1\n- **Fitness of *P1P2*:** 1\n- **Fitness of *P2P2*:** 0.9\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Equilibrium Frequencies and Fitness Values**\n\n**Let\u2019s cross-check:**  \n- **Equilibrium frequency of P1 (\\( p^* \\)):** 0.97\n- **Equilibrium frequency of P2 (\\( q^* \\)):** 0.03\n\n**Does this match any option?**  \nLooking at the options:\n- **(A)** 1, 1, 0.97  \n- **(B)** 1, 1, 0.1  \n- **(C)** 1, 1, 0.03  \n- **(D)** 1, 0.5, 0.97  \n\n**Wait\u2014** I initially calculated \\( p^* \\) as 0.97, which matches option (A). But the fitness of *P1P2* is 1, which also aligns with the options.\n\n**Checking Consistency:**  \n- **Equilibrium frequency of P1:** 0.97\n- **Fitness values match our calculations.**\n\n**But let's pause here\u2014** The fitness of *P1P2* is 1, which aligns with option (A). But if we're considering a selection coefficient of 0.1, shouldn't there be a slight fitness reduction in the heterozygote? Let me think about this again.\n\n### **Reflection and Potential Adjustment**\n\n**Is the Heterozygote Overestimated?**  \nTypically, recessive alleles only affect homozygotes. However, some models consider potential dominance effects, but nothing in the question suggests that.\n\n**Decision:**  \nSince the question specifies a deleterious recessive allele affecting only *P2P2*, the heterozygote fitness should indeed be 1.\n\n**Possible Confusion:**  \nI'm wondering if the heterozygote fitness could be reduced further by the selection coefficient. But given the problem's specifics\u2014recessive deleterious effect only in *P2P2*\u2014the heterozygote should have full fitness.\n\n**Reassurance:**  \nThe calculations align with the options provided, and considering the specificity of the deleterious effect (only in *P2P2*), the heterozygote fitness remains 1.\n\n### **Final Step: Selecting the Correct Option**\n\nGiven the calculated:\n- **Fitness of *P1P1*:** 1\n- **Fitness of *P1P2*:** 1\n- **Equilibrium frequency of P1:** 0.97\n\nThe **correct option** that matches these values is **(A) 1, 1, 0.97**.\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Checks**\n\n**Does the solution make sense?**  \n- The equilibrium frequency of P1 is 0.97, indicating a strong preference for the favored allele.\n- The fitness values are consistent with the selection coefficient and allele effects.\n\n**Checking Against Other Options:**\n- **(B)** 1, 1, 0.1: Incorrect frequency for P1.\n- **(C)** 1, 1, 0.03: Incorrect frequency for P1.\n- **(D)** 1, 0.5, 0.97: Wrong heterozygote fitness.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOption **(A) 1, 1, 0.97** is correct, aligning with our calculations and the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Reflection:**  \nThis approach utilizing the **Mutation-Selection Balance Model** effectively addressed the problem by balancing the mutation introducing P2 and the selection removing it. Initially considering Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium helped anchor the thought process, but recognizing its limitations without equilibrium conditions directed me toward the appropriate model. Throughout, checking calculations and reflecting on the biological significance ensured the solution's accuracy.\n\n**Mistakes and Corrections:**  \nInitially, there was a moment of uncertainty regarding the fitness of *P1P2*. However, verifying that the deleterious effect was recessive and only impacting *P2P2* clarified that the heterozygote's fitness remains at 1.\n\n**Final Check:**  \n- All calculations align with the provided options.\n- The fitness values are biologically plausible given the selection coefficient.\n- The equilibrium frequency of P1 makes sense in the context of strong selection against P2.",

  "ground_truth": "1, 1, 0.97\n\nPopulation genetics works with the Hardy-Weinberg null model to allow for the calculation of genotype frequencies when no drivers of evolutionary change are operating. With this, changes in frequencies relative to the Hardy-Weinberg predictions allow for predictions and explanations about the acting evolutionary processes. The model works with the equation: p(squared)+2pq+q(squared)=1 When the Hardy-Weinberg assumptions are broken by the presence of evolutionary processes, the model is adjusted to account for them. \n\nIn this question's case, natural selection and mutation are present. \n\nThis means two things: \n\n1. Fitness is to be applied \n2. An equilibrium frequency needs to be determined\n\nIn population genetics fitness for the favored or selected allele is always 1 while the unfavored allele is 1-s, where \u201cs\u201d is the selection coefficient (here given). Thus, fitness for genotypes P1P1 and P1P2 are both 1, since the unselected or deleterious mutation is recessive requiring both alleles to be P2, giving the P2P2 genotype 1-s fitness. Finally, to obtain the equilibrium frequency of a favored allele when both selection and mutation are in place, one must only calculate for p = 1 - square root of \u03bc/s. This is called the mutation-selection balance where natural selection increases the frequency of one allele while mutation produces the other."
