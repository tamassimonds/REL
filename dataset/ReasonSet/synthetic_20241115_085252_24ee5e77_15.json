  "problem": "Question: A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?\n\n\n\nOptions:\n(A) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.\n\n\n(B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate mother\u2019s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.\n\n(D) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.",

I'll walk you through my thought process just like I would if I were solving this on paper, reflecting and adjusting as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have a scientist using the **CRISPR-Cas9 system** to modify a 1-cell fertilized egg by injecting:\n\n- **Cas9 messenger RNA (mRNA)**\n- **A guide RNA (gRNA)**\n- **Donor DNA carrying a transgene**\n\nAfter transferring the modified embryo into a surrogate, the resulting animal shows **genomic differences across various tissues**. This suggests **mosaicism**, where different cells have different genetic makeups.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Why would different cells have different genomes?**\n  - Maybe the genetic modification occurred at different stages?\n  - Could there be multiple integration events?\n  - Is there a possibility of incomplete or inconsistent editing?\n\nLet's explore these ideas further.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Continuous Cas9 Activity**\n\n**Option (A):** The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA, leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\n- **Continuous Cutting:** If Cas9 remained active beyond the initial stage, it could cause edits at different times as the embryo divides.\n- **Multiple Integration Events:** This could lead to some cells incorporating the transgene while others do not, resulting in mosaicism.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, continuous activity could indeed lead to varying genetic makeup across cells.\n- **Is Cas9 typically designed this way?** Normally, Cas9 is transiently active. However, if mRNA persists or if the Cas9 protein remains stable, it could cause prolonged activity.\n\n**Verdict:** This seems plausible. Let's keep it in mind but explore other options to be sure.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Unintended Integration of gRNA or Donor DNA**\n\n**Option (B):** The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo, leading to different genomes.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\n- **gRNA-DNA Complex:** gRNA typically guides Cas9 to the target site; it's not meant to integrate into the genome.\n- **Mechanism Unclear:** How would the gRNA-donor DNA complex integrate on its own? This doesn't align with the standard CRISPR mechanism.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, that doesn't sound right\u2026** The gRNA is not designed to integrate into the DNA; it's just a guide.\n- **Does this happen in CRISPR?** No, gRNA doesn't incorporate into the genome. The donor DNA is what's meant to integrate, guided by the gRNA.\n\n**Verdict:** This option seems flawed. I'll discard it as unlikely.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Introduction of Surrogate's DNA**\n\n**Option (C):** The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate mother\u2019s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development, causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\n- **Surrogate's DNA Mixing:** Is it possible for the surrogate's DNA to mix with the embryo's?\n- **Transmission Mechanism:** CRISPR doesn't have a mechanism to incorporate external DNA like the surrogate\u2019s into the embryo\u2019s genome.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Let me think\u2026** There's no known pathway for surrogate DNA to be incorporated via CRISPR. This seems far-fetched.\n- **Does this make sense?** No, the surrogate mother\u2019s DNA should remain separate from the embryo's.\n\n**Verdict:** This option doesn't make sense. I'll rule it out.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 4: Integration of Cas9 mRNA as cDNA**\n\n**Option (D):** The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development, leading to the different genomes.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\n- **mRNA to cDNA Conversion:** This would require reverse transcriptase activity to convert mRNA into cDNA.\n- **Unlikely Event:** While cells do contain reverse transcriptase activity, it's rare for mRNA like Cas9 to be reverse transcribed and integrated into the genome.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a minute\u2026** This sounds improbable. Cas9 mRNA is meant to be transient and produce the Cas9 protein, not integrate into the DNA.\n- **Is this a known CRISPR outcome?** No, this is not a standard outcome of CRISPR-Cas9 editing.\n\n**Verdict:** This option seems unlikely.

  "ground_truth": "The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.\n\n\n\nCorrect answer- The presence of different genomes in cells of a single animal is called mosaicism and has been observed in almost all transgenic animals created through the microinjection of components of CRISPR-Cas9 system into a fertilized egg/zygote.\nAmong other probable causes, the continuous cutting by the Cas9 enzyme at the initial stages of egg cleavage giving rise to populations of cells with different incorporation of donor DNA is a main cause of mosaicism. This can be reduced by directly using Cas9 protein instead of Cas9 messenger RNA, shortening the Cas9 half-life by tagging it for degradation or targeting the unfertilized egg instead.\n\nThe other answers are not the right ones because it is not possible to integrate the guide RNA into the genome seeing as it is RNA, in addition the likelihood of Cas9 messenger RNA being reverse transcribed into cDNA inside of a mammalian cell is very low, integration of such a cDNA into the cell's genome without the accompanying required elements is almost zero. Lastly, the incorporation of the surrogate mother's DNA into the transgenic embryo/fetus is not possible. While studies have shown a few cells from the surrogate can escape into the fetus, this would happen much latter into the fetal development and not during the crucial initial stages of zygote cleaving when the components of CRISPR system may still be active. If the surrogate's cell escape into fetus, They would be too few in comparison to the trillions of cells already formed in the fetus. In addition intergration into the fetus' genome without the required accompanying factors would be a very unlikely occurrence."
