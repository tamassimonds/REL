    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and take it step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way. Let's make this as human-like as possible, with all the messy thinking and reflections included.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the expression \\(\\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i}\\), my immediate reaction is that this looks like a complex fraction\u2014similar to simplifying real-number fractions, but now we're dealing with imaginary numbers too. Here's what comes to mind:\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. This is a common technique for eliminating imaginary parts in the denominator.\n\n- **Strategy 2:** Break it up into real and imaginary parts to see if it simplifies directly. Maybe separating the real and imaginary components could help.\n\n- **Strategy 3:** Use a graphical approach or polar form, but that seems more advanced and unnecessary for this problem.\n\nI'm leaning towards **Strategy 1**, multiplying by the conjugate, because that's a straightforward method for complex fractions. But let me brainstorm a bit more to make sure.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Multiplying by the Conjugate**\n\n1. **Conjugate of the Denominator:**  \n   The denominator is \\(1 + 2i\\). Its conjugate is \\(1 - 2i\\).  \n   \n   - *Reflection:* This makes sense because multiplying by the conjugate often eliminates the imaginary part in the denominator.\n\n2. **Multiplying Numerator and Denominator by the Conjugate:**  \n   \\[\n   \\dfrac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} \\times \\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \\dfrac{(3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)}{(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Denominator:**  \n   \\[\n   (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - 4(-1) = 1 + 4 = 5\n   \\]  \n   - *Check:* Wait, that seems right\u2014multiplying a complex number by its conjugate gives a real number (the product of the squares of the real and imaginary parts).\n\n4. **Calculating the Numerator:**  \n   \\[\n   (3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) = 3(1) + 3(-2i) + 4i(1) + 4i(-2i) = 3 - 6i + 4i - 8i^2\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   = 3 - 6i + 4i + 8 \\quad \\text{(since \\(i^2 = -1\\))}\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   = 3 + 8 - 6i + 4i = 11 - 2i\n   \\]  \n   - *Reflection:* That looks good. Combining like terms seems to work here.\n\n5. **Putting It All Together:**  \n   \\[\n   \\dfrac{11 - 2i}{5} = \\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2i}{5}\n   \\]  \n   - *Check:* Breaking it into real and imaginary parts seems correct.\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\nBefore moving on, let's verify if this makes sense.\n\n- **Real Part:** \\(\\dfrac{11}{5}\\) is \\(2.2\\), which seems reasonable.\n  \n- **Imaginary Part:** \\(-\\dfrac{2}{5}\\) is \\(-0.4\\), also reasonable.\n\nI think the approach is correct so far, but let's try **Strategy 2**\u2014breaking it up into real and imaginary parts\u2014to see if we arrive at the same conclusion.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**\n\n1. **Expressing the Fraction as Real and Imaginary Components:**  \n   \\[\n   \\dfrac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} = \\dfrac{A + Bi}{1 + 2i} \\quad \\text{(Where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are real numbers)}\n   \\]\n   \n   - *Idea:* Multiply both sides by \\(1 + 2i\\):\n   \\[\n   3 + 4i = (A + Bi)(1 + 2i) = A + 2Ai + Bi + 2Bi^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = A + Bi + 2Ai + 2B(-1) = (A - 2B) + (2A + B)i\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Setting Up Equations Based on Real and Imaginary Parts:**  \n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases} \n   A - 2B = 3 \\\\ \n   2A + B = 4 \n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   \n   - *Reflection:* This looks like a system of linear equations. Let\u2019s solve it.\n\n3. **Solving the System of Equations:**  \n   \n   - **Multiply the First Equation by 2:**\n     \\[\n     2A - 4B = 6\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Adding to the Second Equation:**\n     \\[\n     (2A - 4B) + (2A + B) = 6 + 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4A - 3B = 10\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Solving for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):**  \n     - Unclear at this point\u2014let's proceed with multiplying the first equation by 2 and adding to the second.\n     \n     - *Check for Mistake:* Wait, this seems off. Let's go back.\n\n4. **Recalculating Correctly:**\n   \n   - **Multiply the First Equation by 2:**\n     \\[\n     2A - 4B = 6\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Adding to the Second Equation:**\n     \\[\n     (2A - 4B) + (2A + B) = 6 + 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4A - 3B = 10\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Solving for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):**\n     - But we only need to solve this system.\n     - Let's multiply the second equation by 2 to align:\n       \\[\n       4A + 2B = 8\n       \\]\n     - Subtract from the first:\n       \\[\n       (4A - 4B) - (4A + 2B) = 10 - 8\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       -6B = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad B = -\\dfrac{1}{3}\n       \\]\n     - *Huh?* This doesn't seem correct the first time. Let me think.\n\n5. **Identifying the Mistake:**\n   \n   - **Backtracking:** Oh wait, I realize I may have multiplied incorrectly or added the wrong equations.\n   \n   - **Reflecting:** Maybe instead of adding, I should have subtracted the equations differently.\n\n6. **Correcting the Approach:**\n   \n   - **Original Equations:**\n     \\[\n     \\begin{cases} \n     A - 2B = 3 \\\\ \n     2A + B = 4 \n     \\end{cases}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Multiply the First by 2:**\n     \\[\n     2A - 4B = 6\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Subtract Second from First:**\n     \\[\n     (2A - 4B) - (2A + B) = 6 - 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -5B = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad B = -\\dfrac{2}{5}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Substitute \\(B\\) Back to Find \\(A\\):**\n     \\[\n     A - 2(-\\dfrac{2}{5}) = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad A + \\dfrac{4}{5} = 3\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     A = 3 - \\dfrac{4}{5} = \\dfrac{15}{5} - \\dfrac{4}{5} = \\dfrac{11}{5}\n     \\]\n   \n7. **Confirming the Solution:**\n   \n   - **Values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):**\n     \\[\n     A = \\dfrac{11}{5}, \\quad B = -\\dfrac{2}{5}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Final Simplified Form:**\n     \\[\n     \\dfrac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} = \\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2i}{5}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Reflection:** This matches the result we got from Strategy 1. *That\u2019s reassuring!*\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth strategies lead us to the same simplified form:\n\\[\n\\dfrac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} = \\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2i}{5}\n\\]\n\nBy exploring different methods\u2014multiplying by the conjugate and separating real and imaginary parts\u2014we confirmed that the answer is consistent. Throughout the process, reflecting and checking helped catch and correct mistakes, ensuring the final result is accurate.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[\na = \\dfrac{11}{5}, \\quad b = -\\dfrac{2}{5}\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dfrac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} = \\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2i}{5}\n\\]",
