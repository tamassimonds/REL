Let's tackle it step by step.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**For how many integer values of \\( x \\) is \\( 5x^{2} + 19x + 16 > 20 \\) not satisfied?**\n\nI think, \"This looks like an inequality involving a quadratic function.\" Quadratics remind me of parabolas, and their inequalities often require finding specific \\( x \\)-values where the graph lies above or below a certain line.\n\nHowever, I'm also recalling that not all quadratics have their vertex at the origin or are easily factorable. The constants involved (like 5, 19, and 16) make me wonder if completing the square or using the quadratic formula might be necessary.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Rearrange the Inequality:**\n   - Move all terms to one side to set the inequality to zero.\n\n2. **Find x-Intercepts:**\n   - Determine where the quadratic equals 20 to find critical points.\n\n3. **Test Intervals:**\n   - Use test points in each interval between the x-intercepts to see where the inequality holds.\n\n4. **Complete the Square:**\n   - Rewrite the quadratic in vertex form to analyze its graph.\n\n5. **Use the Quadratic Formula:**\n   - If factoring is tough, apply the quadratic formula to find the exact points where the quadratic equals 20.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\nI think rearranging the inequality is a good starting point, followed by finding the x-intercepts. This way, I can set up test intervals to see where the quadratic is greater than 20.\n\n### **Step 1: Rearranging the Inequality**\n\nLet's start by moving all terms to one side:\n\n\\[ 5x^{2} + 19x + 16 > 20 \\]\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 5x^{2} + 19x + 16 - 20 > 0 \\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 5x^{2} + 19x - 4 > 0 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems like a good first step because it sets up the quadratic inequality in standard form. Now, I can proceed to find the x-intercepts, which will help in testing the intervals.\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the x-Intercepts**\n\nTo find where the quadratic equals 20, set the equation equal to zero:\n\n\\[ 5x^{2} + 19x - 4 = 0 \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\nHmm, this looks like a standard quadratic equation. I remember that I can try factoring first, but if that doesn't work, the quadratic formula is always an option.\n\nLet me check if it factors easily:\n\n\\[ 5x^{2} + 19x - 4 = 0 \\]\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\( 5 \\times (-4) = -20 \\) and add to \\( 19 \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\nBut wait, can I find such numbers? Multiplying to -20 and adding to 19...\n\n**Attempting to Factor:**\nLet me list some possible pairs:\n\n- \\( 1 \\times -20 = -20 \\) and \\( 1 + (-20) = -19 \\) (close, but not 19)\n- \\( 2 \\times -10 = -20 \\) and \\( 2 + (-10) = -8 \\) (still not it)\n- \\( 4 \\times -5 = -20 \\) and \\( 4 + (-5) = -1 \\) (off again)\n\n**Realization:**\nOkay, factoring doesn't seem to work here. Maybe the numbers are larger or more complex than what I'm thinking.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\nLooks like I need to use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a = 5 \\)\n- \\( b = 19 \\)\n- \\( c = -4 \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Compute the Discriminant:**\n\n   \\[ b^{2} - 4ac = 19^{2} - 4 \\times 5 \\times (-4) = 361 + 80 = 441 \\]\n\n2. **Take the Square Root of the Discriminant:**\n\n   \\[ \\sqrt{441} = 21 \\]\n\n3. **Apply the Quadratic Formula:**\n\n   \\[ x = \\frac{-19 \\pm 21}{10} \\]\n\n   - First solution:\n\n     \\[ x = \\frac{-19 + 21}{10} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5} \\]\n\n   - Second solution:\n\n     \\[ x = \\frac{-19 - 21}{10} = \\frac{-40}{10} = -4 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nAlright, so the x-intercepts are \\( x = \\frac{1}{5} \\) and \\( x = -4 \\). This means the quadratic touches the line \\( y = 20 \\) at these points. I can use these points to create intervals for testing.\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up Test Intervals**\n\nNow, I'll create intervals based on the x-intercepts to determine where the quadratic is greater than 20.\n\n**Intervals:**\n1. \\( (-\\infty, -4) \\)\n2. \\( (-4, \\frac{1}{5}) \\)\n3. \\( (\\frac{1}{5}, \\infty) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nThese intervals look good because they are separated by the x-intercepts. Now, I'll pick test points from each interval to see if the inequality holds.\n\n### **Step 4: Testing the Intervals**\n\nLet's test each interval to see where \\( 5x^{2} + 19x - 4 > 0 \\).\n\n**Interval 1: \\( (-\\infty, -4) \\)**\n\nChoose a test point, say \\( x = -5 \\):\n\n\\[ 5(-5)^{2} + 19(-5) - 4 = 5(25) - 95 - 4 = 125 - 95 - 4 = 26 \\]\n\n**Natural Check:**\nWait, \\( 26 > 0 \\). That's good. So, the quadratic is above 20 in this interval.\n\n**Interval 2: \\( (-4, \\frac{1}{5}) \\)**\n\nChoose a test point, say \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 5(0)^{2} + 19(0) - 4 = 0 - 4 = -4 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, \\( -4 < 0 \\). So, the quadratic is below 20 in this interval. That makes sense since the vertex of the parabola is likely a minimum point.\n\n**Interval 3: \\( (\\frac{1}{5}, \\infty) \\)**\n\nChoose a test point, say \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ 5(1)^{2} + 19(1) - 4 = 5 + 19 - 4 = 20 \\]\n\n**Natural Check:**\nWait, \\( 20 = 20 \\). But the inequality is strict (\\( > \\)), so the quadratic is exactly 20 at \\( x = 1 \\). Let's try a slightly larger number, say \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ 5(2)^{2} + 19(2) - 4 = 20 + 38 - 4 = 54 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nAlright, \\( 54 > 20 \\). So, the quadratic is above 20 in this interval after \\( x = \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n\n### **Step 5: Analyzing the Inequality**\n\nFrom the interval testing:\n\n- **In \\( (-\\infty, -4) \\)**: The inequality is satisfied (\\( > 20 \\)).\n- **In \\( (-4, \\frac{1}{5}) \\)**: The inequality is **not** satisfied (\\( \\leq 20 \\)).\n- **At \\( x = -4 \\)**: Let's check:\n\n  \\[ 5(-4)^{2} + 19(-4) - 4 = 80 - 76 - 4 = 0 \\]\n\n  Since \\( 0 \\leq 20 \\), the inequality is not satisfied at this point.\n\n- **In \\( (\\frac{1}{5}, \\infty) \\)**: The inequality is satisfied (\\( > 20 \\)), except at \\( x = \\frac{1}{5} \\), where:\n\n  \\[ 5\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^{2} + 19\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) - 4 = 5\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right) + \\frac{19}{5} - 4 = \\frac{1}{5} + 3.8 - 4 = 0.2 \\]\n\n  Since \\( 0.2 < 20 \\), the inequality is not satisfied at \\( x = \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, let's double-check the calculations for \\( x = \\frac{1}{5} \\):\n\n- Original expression:\n\n  \\[ 5\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^{2} + 19\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) - 4 = 5\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right) + \\frac{19}{5} - 4 \\]\n\n  \\[ = \\frac{1}{5} + 3.8 - 4 \\]\n\n  \\[ = 0.2 \\]\n\nSo, at \\( x = \\frac{1}{5} \\), the inequality is **not** satisfied. This matches my earlier reflection.\n\n### **Step 6: Identifying the Integer Values of x**\n\nNow, I need to find all integer \\( x \\) values where the inequality is **not** satisfied.\n\n**From the analysis:**\n\n- The inequality is not satisfied at:\n  - \\( x = -4 \\)\n  - \\( x = \\frac{1}{5} \\) (but since we're only considering integers, this doesn't count)\n  \n**Conclusion:**\nOnly \\( x = -4 \\) is an integer where the inequality is not satisfied.\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, that can't be right because I initially thought there might be more integers where the inequality is not satisfied. Let me reconsider the intervals and see if I've missed anything.\n\n**Re-checking the Intervals:**\nUpon revisiting, I realize that the inequality is not satisfied **within** the interval \\( (-4, \\frac{1}{5}) \\). So, I should consider all integer \\( x \\) values between \\( -4 \\) and \\( 0 \\), inclusive, because those are the integers where the quadratic is below or equal to 20.\n\n**Thinking it Through:**\nHmm, let's list those integers:\n\n- \\( -4 \\)\n- \\( -3 \\)\n- \\( -2 \\)\n- \\( -1 \\)\n- \\( 0 \\)\n\n**Checking Each:**\n\n- **\\( x = -4 \\)**: Already checked, equals 20, so not satisfied.\n- **\\( x = -3 \\)**:\n\n  \\[ 5(-3)^{2} + 19(-3) - 4 = 45 - 57 - 4 = -16 \\]\n\n  \\( -16 < 20 \\). Not satisfied.\n\n- **\\( x = -2 \\)**:\n\n  \\[ 5(-2)^{2} + 19(-2) - 4 = 20 - 38 - 4 = -22 \\]\n\n  \\( -22 < 20 \\). Not satisfied.\n\n- **\\( x = -1 \\)**:\n\n  \\[ 5(-1)^{2} + 19(-1) - 4 = 5 - 19 - 4 = -18 \\]\n\n  \\( -18 < 20 \\). Not satisfied.\n\n- **\\( x = 0 \\)**:\n\n  \\[ 5(0)^{2} + 19(0) - 4 = 0 - 4 = -4 \\]\n\n  \\( -4 < 20 \\). Not satisfied.\n\n**Reflection:**\nAh, I see now. The inequality is not satisfied for all integers from \\( x = -4 \\) to \\( x = 0 \\), inclusive. That's a total of 5 integer values.\n\n### **Step 7: Final Answer**\n\nSo, the integer values of \\( x \\) where the inequality \\( 5x^{2} + 19x + 16 > 20 \\) is **not** satisfied are:\n\n\\[ x = -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 \\]\n\n**Total Count:**\n**Five** integer values.\n\n**Final Check:**\nLet me quickly verify if each value makes the inequality not satisfied:\n\n- **\\( x = -4 \\)**: Equals 20.\n- **\\( x = -3 \\)**: \\( -16 < 20 \\).\n- **\\( x = -2 \\)**: \\( -22 < 20 \\).\n- **\\( x = -1 \\)**: \\( -18 < 20 \\).\n- **\\( x = 0 \\)**: \\( -4 < 20 \\).\n\nAll checks are correct. The inequality is not satisfied for all these integers.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming different strategies, rearranging the inequality, finding the x-intercepts, and testing intervals, I've determined that there are **five** integer values of \\( x \\) where the inequality \\( 5x^{2} + 19x + 16 > 20 \\) is **not** satisfied:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]",

  "ground_truth": "We can simplify the inequality to $5x^{2}+19x-4 > 0$, which can then be factored into $(5x-1)(x+4)>0$. We see that this inequality is satisfied when $x<-4$ and $\\frac{1}{5}<x$, because in former case $5x-1$ and $x+4$ are both negative, and in the latter case they are both positive. This means that the inequality is not satisfied for $x$ between $-4$ and $\\frac{1}{5}$. The integer values of $x$ in this range are $-4, -3, -2, -1, \\text{ and }0$, and there are $\\boxed{5}$ of them."
