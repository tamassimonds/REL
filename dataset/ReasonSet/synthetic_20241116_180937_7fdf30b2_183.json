    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, reflect, and check my work as I go along.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the problem involves a piecewise function \\( f(x) \\) defined as:\n\n\\[\nf(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2 - 4 & \\text{if } x \\ge -4 \\\\\nx + 3 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nWe're asked to find how many values of \\( x \\) satisfy \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Outer and Inner Functions:** Since we're dealing with \\( f(f(x)) \\), it's a composite function. This reminds me that I need to consider both the inner and outer applications of \\( f(x) \\).\n- **Solving for 5:** I need to think about what values \\( f(x) \\) can take to make \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\).\n- **Piecewise Nature:** The fact that \\( f(x) \\) is piecewise complicates things a bit. I might have to analyze different cases based on the definition of \\( f(x) \\).\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - Find \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 5 \\) and then see which of these \\( x \\) satisfy \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\).\n  - Alternatively, determine where \\( f(x) \\) can equal 5 and backtrack from there.\n  - Consider graphing \\( f(x) \\) to visualize the solution, but that might be time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\n### **Second Thoughts: Exploring the First Strategy**\n\nI think starting with finding \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 5 \\) makes sense. From there, I'll examine which of these \\( x \\) also satisfy \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\).\n\n**Step 1: Find \\( x \\) Where \\( f(x) = 5 \\)**\n\nLet's set up the equation based on the piecewise definition:\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\( x \\ge -4 \\)\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 4 = 5\n   \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x^2 = 9 \\implies x = 3 \\text{ or } x = -3\n     \\]\n     - Both \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\) are greater than or equal to \\( -4 \\), so they are valid solutions.\n\n2. **Case 2:** \\( x < -4 \\)\n   \\[\n   x + 3 = 5\n   \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 2\n     \\]\n     - However, \\( x = 2 \\) is not less than \\( -4 \\). So, there's no valid solution in this case.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Valid Solutions:** From **Case 1**, we have \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\).\n- **Check:** Wait, let me quickly check if these satisfy \\( f(x) = 5 \\):\n  - For \\( x = 3 \\): \\( f(3) = 3^2 - 4 = 5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - For \\( x = -3 \\): \\( f(-3) = (-3)^2 - 4 = 5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - Both are correct.\n\n### **Third Thoughts: Moving Forward with \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\)**\n\nNow, I need to find \\( x \\) such that \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\). This means \\( f(x) \\) must be either \\( 3 \\) or \\( -3 \\) since \\( f(3) = 5 \\) and \\( f(-3) = 5 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Find \\( x \\) Such That \\( f(x) = 3 \\) or \\( f(x) = -3 \\)**\n\nLet's tackle each case separately.\n\n#### **Case A: \\( f(x) = 3 \\)**\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\( x \\ge -4 \\)\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 4 = 3\n   \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x^2 = 7 \\implies x = \\sqrt{7} \\text{ or } x = -\\sqrt{7}\n     \\]\n     - Both \\( \\sqrt{7} \\) and \\( -\\sqrt{7} \\) are approximately \\( 2.65 \\) and \\( -2.65 \\), respectively, which are greater than or equal to \\( -4 \\).\n\n2. **Case 2:** \\( x < -4 \\)\n   \\[\n   x + 3 = 3\n   \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 0\n     \\]\n     - But \\( x = 0 \\) is not less than \\( -4 \\). So, no solution here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Valid Solutions for \\( f(x) = 3 \\):** \\( x = \\sqrt{7} \\) and \\( x = -\\sqrt{7} \\).\n- **Check:**\n  - For \\( x = \\sqrt{7} \\): \\( f(\\sqrt{7}) = (\\sqrt{7})^2 - 4 = 3 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - For \\( x = -\\sqrt{7} \\): \\( f(-\\sqrt{7}) = (-\\sqrt{7})^2 - 4 = 3 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n#### **Case B: \\( f(x) = -3 \\)**\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\( x \\ge -4 \\)\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 4 = -3\n   \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x^2 = 1 \\implies x = 1 \\text{ or } x = -1\n     \\]\n     - Both \\( 1 \\) and \\( -1 \\) are greater than or equal to \\( -4 \\).\n\n2. **Case 2:** \\( x < -4 \\)\n   \\[\n   x + 3 = -3\n   \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = -6\n     \\]\n     - \\( x = -6 \\) is less than \\( -4 \\), so it's a valid solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Valid Solutions for \\( f(x) = -3 \\):** \\( x = 1 \\), \\( x = -1 \\), and \\( x = -6 \\).\n- **Check:**\n  - For \\( x = 1 \\): \\( f(1) = 1^2 - 4 = -3 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - For \\( x = -1 \\): \\( f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 4 = -3 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - For \\( x = -6 \\): \\( f(-6) = -6 + 3 = -3 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n### **Fourth Thoughts: Compiling All Solutions**\n\nSo far, the solutions I've found are:\n- From **Case A:** \\( x = \\sqrt{7} \\), \\( x = -\\sqrt{7} \\)\n- From **Case B:** \\( x = 1 \\), \\( x = -1 \\), \\( x = -6 \\)\n\n**Wait a moment...** Let me double-check to ensure these are the only solutions.\n\n**Checking if \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\) for These \\( x \\):**\n- **For \\( x = \\sqrt{7} \\):**\n  - \\( f(\\sqrt{7}) = 3 \\)\n  - \\( f(f(\\sqrt{7})) = f(3) = 5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **For \\( x = -\\sqrt{7} \\):**\n  - \\( f(-\\sqrt{7}) = 3 \\)\n  - \\( f(f(-\\sqrt{7})) = f(3) = 5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **For \\( x = 1 \\):**\n  - \\( f(1) = -3 \\)\n  - \\( f(f(1)) = f(-3) = 5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **For \\( x = -1 \\):**\n  - \\( f(-1) = -3 \\)\n  - \\( f(f(-1)) = f(-3) = 5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **For \\( x = -6 \\):**\n  - \\( f(-6) = -3 \\)\n  - \\( f(f(-6)) = f(-3) = 5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Everything checks out!** All these \\( x \\) satisfy \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\).\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Counting the Solutions**\n\nNow, let's count the number of valid \\( x \\) values:\n\n- \\( x = \\sqrt{7} \\)\n- \\( x = -\\sqrt{7} \\)\n- \\( x = 1 \\)\n- \\( x = -1 \\)\n- \\( x = -6 \\)\n\n**Total:** There are **five** values of \\( x \\) that satisfy \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\).\n\n**Wait, does that seem right?** Let me quickly verify if there could be any other solutions I might have missed. But given the piecewise nature and the checks I've done, I believe five is correct.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter thoroughly exploring different strategies, checking each step, and ensuring all cases are covered, the final answer is that there are **five** values of \\( x \\) for which \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\).\n\n**Answer:**\nFive values of \\( x \\) satisfy \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let $y = f(x)$. Then, $f(f(x)) = f(y) = 5$, so either $x^2 - 4 = 5$ or $x + 3 = 5$. Solving the first equations yields that $y = f(x) = \\pm 3$, both of which are greater than or equal to $-4$. The second equation yields that $y = 2$, but we discard this solution because $y \\ge -4$.\n\nHence $f(x) = \\pm 3$, so $x^2 - 4 = \\pm 3$ or $x + 3 = \\pm 3$. The first equation yields that $x = \\pm 1, \\pm \\sqrt{7}$, all of which are greater than or equal to $-4$. The second equation yields that $x = -6, 0$, of which only the first value, $x = -6$, is less than $-4$. Hence, there are $\\boxed{5}$ values of $x$ that satisfy $f(f(x)) = 5$: $x = -6, -\\sqrt{7}, -1, 1, \\sqrt{7}$, as we can check."
