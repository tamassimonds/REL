I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their correctness, check my work frequently, and be open to changing direction if something doesn't seem right. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, the problem asks us to compute \\((1 - \\omega + \\omega^2)^4 + (1 + \\omega - \\omega^2)^4\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a nonreal root of \\(x^3 = 1\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Roots of Unity:** This reminds me of complex numbers and roots of unity. I recall that the nonreal roots of \\(x^3 = 1\\) are related to the cube roots of unity.\n  \n- **Symmetry:** The expression involves powers of binomials raised to the fourth power, which looks symmetrical. Maybe there's a pattern or identity I can leverage.\n\n- **Binomial Expansion:** I could expand each term using the binomial theorem, but that seems lengthy. Perhaps there's a more elegant approach.\n\n- **Simplification Opportunities:** Maybe simplifying inside the parentheses before expanding could help.\n\nHmm, I\u2019m not entirely sure which path to take initially. Let\u2019s explore a few strategies to see which one works best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Expand Using Binomial Theorem:**\n   - Expand \\((1 - \\omega + \\omega^2)^4\\) and \\((1 + \\omega - \\omega^2)^4\\) separately using the binomial theorem and then add them together.\n   \n2. **Utilize Properties of Roots of Unity:**\n   - Leverage the fact that \\(\\omega\\) is a root of \\(x^3 = 1\\) to simplify the expressions. Maybe use \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\) and relate \\(\\omega\\) to complex exponentials.\n\n3. **Factorization:**\n   - Look for common factors or patterns that can simplify the expression before expansion.\n\n4. **Symmetry and Simplification:**\n   - Since the terms are symmetrical, perhaps combining them cleverly could lead to cancellation of certain parts.\n\nLet\u2019s start by considering the second strategy: **Utilize Properties of Roots of Unity**. This might simplify things by reducing the complexity of \\(\\omega\\) terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Recall Properties of Roots of Unity**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI know that the cube roots of unity satisfy \\(x^3 = 1\\). The roots are \\(1\\), \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\) are the nonreal roots. Also, \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\) and \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUsing \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\) might help in simplifying the expressions. Let\u2019s see how it applies here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplify the Expressions Inside the Parentheses**\n\n**Applying Simplification:**\n\nConsider \\(1 - \\omega + \\omega^2\\).\n\nUsing \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), we can write:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\omega + \\omega^2 = (1 + \\omega + \\omega^2) - 2\\omega = 0 - 2\\omega = -2\\omega\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for \\(1 + \\omega - \\omega^2\\):\n\n\\[\n1 + \\omega - \\omega^2 = (1 + \\omega + \\omega^2) - 2\\omega^2 = 0 - 2\\omega^2 = -2\\omega^2\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis simplification seems useful. Now the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n(-2\\omega)^4 + (-2\\omega^2)^4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, that can't be right because I noticed that both terms involve \\(\\omega^4\\), but \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^4 = \\omega\\). Let's correct this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Simplification Correctly**\n\n**Correcting the Approach:**\n\nRecall that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\omega^4 = \\omega \\cdot \\omega^3 = \\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n(-2\\omega)^4 = (2\\omega)^4 = 2^4 \\cdot \\omega^4 = 16 \\cdot \\omega\n\\]\n\nAnd:\n\n\\[\n(-2\\omega^2)^4 = (2\\omega^2)^4 = 16 \\cdot \\omega^2\n\\]\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n16\\omega + 16\\omega^2 = 16(\\omega + \\omega^2)\n\\]\n\n**Recollecting Useful Identities:**\n\nFrom \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis simplification leads to:\n\n\\[\n16(-1) = -16\n\\]\n\nThat looks much cleaner. Let\u2019s proceed with this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Computation**\n\n**Calculating the Expression:**\n\nGiven our simplified expression:\n\n\\[\n(1 - \\omega + \\omega^2)^4 + (1 + \\omega - \\omega^2)^4 = 16(\\omega + \\omega^2) = 16(-1) = -16\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- Simplification from \\(1 - \\omega + \\omega^2\\) to \\(-2\\omega\\) and \\(1 + \\omega - \\omega^2\\) to \\(-2\\omega^2\\) is correct.\n- Raising \\(-2\\omega\\) and \\(-2\\omega^2\\) to the fourth power gives \\(16\\omega\\) and \\(16\\omega^2\\) respectively.\n- Adding them together results in \\(16(\\omega + \\omega^2) = 16(-1) = -16\\).\n\nEverything seems to align perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy utilizing the properties of the roots of unity, particularly the relation \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), I was able to simplify the original expression significantly. Initially, I considered expanding the terms using the binomial theorem, but recognizing the symmetry and applying known identities made the calculation much more straightforward.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Correctness Check:** Each step involved verifying the simplifications and ensuring that the properties of \\(\\omega\\) were applied correctly.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** It's always good to consider multiple approaches. Initially thinking about binomial expansion helped me realize that leveraging roots of unity was more efficient.\n- **Mistakes and Corrections:** Correcting the exponent from \\(\\omega^4\\) to \\(\\omega\\) was crucial. It\u2019s a reminder to always keep track of exponents, especially in complex number contexts.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-16}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with continuous reflection and checking, led to the correct and simplified solution.",
