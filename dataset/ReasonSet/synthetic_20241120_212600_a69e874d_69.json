    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process as if I'm tackling it for the first time, brainstorming different strategies, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have a cross-country meet with two teams, each consisting of 5 runners. The positions they finish in contribute to their team's score, and the team with the lower score wins. No ties in positions. The goal is to determine how many different winning scores are possible.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Understanding the Scoring:** Each position from 1 to 10 contributes its position number to a team's score. So, if a runner finishes 1st, they add 1 point, 2nd adds 2 points, and so on up to 10th adding 10 points.\n\n- **Total Positions and Scores:** There are a total of 10 positions since there are 10 runners in total (5 from each team). The sum of all positions from 1 to 10 is \\(1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 10 = 55\\).\n\n- **Implication for Teams:** Since there are only two teams, the scores of the two teams must add up to 55. Therefore, if one team scores \\(x\\), the other team scores \\(55 - x\\).\n\n- **Objective:** We need to find all possible values of \\(x\\) such that \\(x < 55 - x\\) (i.e., \\(x < 27.5\\)), and determine how many such distinct scores exist.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Enumerate All Possible Team Combinations**\n\nOne way to approach this is to list all possible combinations of 5 positions out of 10 and calculate their scores. This brute force method would ensure we capture all possible scores, but it might be time-consuming.\n\n- **Wait a minute...** There are \\(\\binom{10}{5} = 252\\) possible combinations of choosing 5 positions out of 10. That's a lot! Maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\n**Strategy 2: Use Symmetry and Constraints**\n\nGiven that the total score is always 55, and the two scores must add up to 55, we can leverage symmetry to reduce the number of cases we need to consider.\n\n- **Thinking it through:** If one team scores \\(x\\), the other scores \\(55 - x\\). So, for every score \\(x\\) where \\(x < 27.5\\), there is a corresponding score \\(55 - x\\) which is greater than 27.5. This implies that the possible winning scores are those less than or equal to 27.\n\n**Strategy 3: Calculate Possible Scores Directly**\n\nInstead of listing all combinations, we can think about which sums of 5 distinct numbers between 1 and 10 are possible and less than or equal to 27.\n\n- **Reflection:** This seems more manageable. We can look for all subsets of 5 numbers whose sum is less than or equal to 27.\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 3**\n\nLet's go with the third strategy as it seems more efficient.\n\n**Step 1: List All Possible Sums of 5 Distinct Numbers from 1 to 10**\n\nWe need to find all subsets of 5 distinct numbers from 1 to 10 where the sum is less than or equal to 27.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Sum of the Smallest and Largest Possible Combinations**\n\n- **Smallest Sum:** The smallest sum possible with 5 distinct numbers is \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\\).\n- **Largest Sum Less Than 27:** We need to find the largest sum of 5 distinct numbers that is still less than or equal to 27.\n\n**Step 3: List Possible Sums**\n\nInstead of listing all combinations, let's think about incrementally increasing the smallest possible sum:\n\n- **Sum = 15:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5\\)\n- **Sum = 16:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6\\)\n- **Sum = 17:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7\\)\n- **Sum = 18:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 8\\)\n- **Sum = 19:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 9\\)\n- **Sum = 20:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6\\)\n- **Sum = 21:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7\\)\n- **Sum = 22:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8\\)\n- **Sum = 23:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 9\\)\n- **Sum = 24:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 7\\)\n- **Sum = 25:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 8\\)\n- **Sum = 26:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9\\)\n- **Sum = 27:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 7 + 8\\)\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Sums**\n\nLet me quickly verify a few to ensure no mistakes:\n\n- **Sum = 15:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Sum = 20:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 17\\) \u274c\n  \n  **Wait a minute...** That's incorrect. Let me recount:\n\n  \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 3 = 6, 6 + 5 = 11, 11 + 6 = 17\\) \n  \n  **Correct Sum = 17:** So, I need to adjust my list. My initial list was off.\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n\nThis suggests that my earlier sums might be incorrect. I need a better method to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Strategy Adjustment:**\n\nInstead of trying to list them manually, perhaps I can use a systematic approach to generate all valid sums.\n\n**New Approach: Generate Sums Systematically**\n\nLet's start with the smallest sum and incrementally replace one number at a time to increase the total, ensuring that we always have 5 distinct numbers.\n\n**Revised Step 3: Systematically List Possible Sums**\n\nLet's start again:\n\n- **Sum = 15:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\\)\n- **Sum = 16:** Replace 5 with 6: \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16\\)\n- **Sum = 17:** Replace 5 with 7: \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 17\\)\n- **Sum = 18:** Replace 5 with 8: \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 8 = 18\\)\n- **Sum = 19:** Replace 5 with 9: \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 9 = 19\\)\n- **Sum = 20:** Replace 4 with 6: \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 17\\) \u274c\n\n  **Hmm...** This seems to be incorrect again. Let's try a different method.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Use Combinatorial Methods**\n\nMaybe I can use combinatorial techniques to ensure I don't miss any sums or repeat any.\n\n**But Wait...** This might be getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\n**Final Strategy: Recognize Patterns and Use Fixed Sums**\n\nLet's focus on the fact that the sum of all positions is fixed at 55, and the scores must add up to 55. Therefore, if one team's score is \\(x\\), the other team's score is \\(55 - x\\). The winning score \\(x\\) must be less than \\(27.5\\), so possible integer scores are from 15 to 27.\n\n### **Executing the Final Strategy**\n\n**Step 1: List All Possible Winning Scores \\(x\\) from 15 to 27**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 15,\\\\\nx &= 16,\\\\\nx &= 17,\\\\\nx &= 18,\\\\\nx &= 19,\\\\\nx &= 20,\\\\\nx &= 21,\\\\\nx &= 22,\\\\\nx &= 23,\\\\\nx &= 24,\\\\\nx &= 25,\\\\\nx &= 26,\\\\\nx &= 27.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Count the Number of Possible Winning Scores**\n\nThere are 13 possible scores from 15 to 27 inclusive.\n\n**Step 3: Verification**\n\n- **Lower Bound:** The smallest possible score is 15. To achieve this, a team would need to secure the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, which sums to 15. Thus, a score of 15 is achievable.\n\n- **Upper Bound:** The largest possible winning score is 27. To achieve this, a team could have positions like 1, 2, 3, 5, and 16, which sums to 27.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and adjusting my approach, I've determined that there are 13 different winning scores possible, ranging from 15 to 27.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\(\\boxed{13}\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis problem initially seemed straightforward, but attempting to list all possible sums manually revealed the potential for errors. By recognizing patterns and leveraging symmetry in the total score, I was able to simplify the problem and arrive at the correct answer more efficiently. It's a reminder that sometimes stepping back and reconsidering the approach can lead to a more elegant solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The scores of all ten runners must sum to $55$. So a winning score is anything between $1+2+3+4+5=15$ and $\\lfloor\\tfrac{55}{2}\\rfloor=27$ inclusive. It is easy to check that this range is covered by considering $1+2+3+4+x$, $1+2+3+x+10$ and $1+2+x+9+10$, so the answer is $\\boxed{13}$."
