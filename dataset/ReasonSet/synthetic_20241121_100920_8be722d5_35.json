  "problem": "Topsoil costs $\\$6$ per cubic foot. What is the cost, in dollars, of 5 cubic yards of topsoil?",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's craft a coherent and complete solution by integrating the thought process, brainstorming strategies, calculations, and reflections\u2014all while maintaining the final answer. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll proceed:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- We need to find the cost of 5 cubic yards of topsoil with a rate of $6 per cubic foot.\n- **Immediately Noticed:** Different units\u2014cubic yards vs. cubic feet. This hints at a conversion problem.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Unit Conversion First:** Convert cubic yards to cubic feet, then compute the total cost.\n  2. **Calculate Cost per Cubic Yard:** Determine the cost for one cubic yard and multiply by 5.\n  3. **Visualize the Volume:** Break down how cubic yards translate into cubic feet to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Converting cubic yards to cubic feet first seems logical since the cost is given per cubic foot. But let's keep other strategies in mind as a backup.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Strategy 1\u2014Unit Conversion First**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To convert cubic yards to cubic feet, remember that there are 3 feet in a yard.\n- Since we're dealing with **cubic** measurements, we need to cube the conversion factor.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n3 \\text{ feet/yard} \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27 \\text{ cubic feet per cubic yard}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5 \\text{ cubic yards} = 5 \\times 27 = 135 \\text{ cubic feet}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Quick Mental Check:** \\(5 \\times 30 = 150\\), and since 27 is slightly less than 30, 135 makes sense.\n- **Verification:** The conversion seems correct\u2014one cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet, so 5 cubic yards equals 135 cubic feet.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Total Cost**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now that we have the total volume in cubic feet, multiply by the cost per cubic foot.\n\n**Given:**\n\\[\n\\$6 \\text{ per cubic foot}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n135 \\text{ cubic feet} \\times \\$6/\\text{cubic foot} = \\$810\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Initial Reaction:** \\$810 seems substantial, but considering the volume, it aligns.\n- **Quick Check:** \\(100 \\times 6 = 600\\) and \\(35 \\times 6 = 210\\); adding those gives 810. The calculation holds up.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Strategy 2\u2014Calculating Cost per Cubic Yard**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To double-check, calculate the cost of one cubic yard and then multiply by 5.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n1 \\text{ cubic yard} = 27 \\text{ cubic feet} \\times \\$6/\\text{cubic foot} = \\$162\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5 \\text{ cubic yards} = 5 \\times \\$162 = \\$810\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both strategies yield the same total cost (\\$810), reinforcing the correctness of the calculations.\n- **Verification:** Multiple approaches confirming the same result increase confidence in the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Having used two different strategies and arrived at the same answer, it's time for a final check.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- If 1 cubic yard costs \\$162, then \\(5 \\times 162 = 810\\).\n- **Breaking It Down:** \\(5 \\times 100 = 500\\) and \\(5 \\times 62 = 310\\); adding those gives 810. Everything adds up correctly.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **Error Possibility:** None detected\u2014both methods align, and quick mental calculations support the outcome.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>The total cost of 5 cubic yards of topsoil is \\$810.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Identified the need for unit conversion and considered multiple strategies to ensure accuracy.\n- **Strategy Exploration:** Successfully applied both unit conversion and cost per cubic yard approaches, with consistent results.\n- **Frequent Checks:** Conducted quick mental checks and verification steps at each stage to confirm correctness.\n- **Final Verification:** Multiple methods agreeing on the same answer solidify the solution's validity.\n\nBy thoughtfully navigating through different strategies, continuously verifying each step, and ensuring consistency across methods, we've confidently arrived at the correct solution: The total cost is \\$810.",
  "ground_truth": "Cubing both sides of the equation $1\\text{ yd.}=3\\text{ ft.}$, we find that $1\\text{ yd.}^3=27\\text{ ft.}^3$.  Therefore, there are $27\\cdot5$ cubic feet in 5 cubic yards.  Multiplying the number of cubic feet by the cost per cubic foot, we find that the total cost is $27\\cdot5\\cdot6=27\\cdot30=\\boxed{810}$ dollars."
