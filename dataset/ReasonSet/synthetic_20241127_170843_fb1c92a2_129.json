We'll ensure it reads smoothly while preserving the authenticity of the step-by-step reflection and brainstorming.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Impressions:**\n- **Question:** How many positive integers smaller than 1,000,000 are powers of 2 but not powers of 8?\n- **Initial Thoughts:** Powers of 2 and 8 are related since \\(8 = 2^3\\). This implies that every power of 8 is also a power of 2. To find the desired numbers, I need to identify powers of 2 that aren\u2019t additionally powers of 8.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Listing Method:** Enumerate all powers of 2 up to 1,000,000 and exclude those that are also powers of 8.\n2. **Exponential Analysis:** Use properties of exponents to differentiate between powers of 2 and 8.\n3. **Logical Subtraction:** Calculate the total powers of 2 and subtract the overlapping powers of 8.\n\n**Reflection and Decision:**\n- **Listing seems straightforward but potentially lengthy.** A formulaic approach might be more efficient.\n- **Final Choice:** Proceed with calculating powers of 2 up to 1,000,000 and subtracting those that are also powers of 8.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying Powers of 2 Less Than 1,000,000**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Objective:** Find all \\(2^k\\) where \\(2^k < 1,000,000\\).\n- **Brainstorm:** Recalling that \\(2^{10} \\approx 1,024\\), which is just over 1,000, helps estimate the upper limit for \\(k\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Estimate \\(k\\):** Since \\(2^{20} \\approx 1,048,576\\) (just over a million), the largest \\(k\\) satisfying \\(2^k < 1,000,000\\) is \\(k = 19\\).\n  \n**Verification:**\n- **Quick Check:** \\(2^{19} = 524,288\\), which is indeed less than 1,000,000.\n\n**List of Powers of 2:**\n- \\(2^0 = 1\\)\n- \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- ...\n- Continue up to \\(2^{19} = 524,288\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, these are all the powers of 2 within the given limit.\n\n**Checkpoint:**\n- **Total Count:** 20 powers of 2 (including \\(2^0\\)).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Powers of 8 Less Than 1,000,000**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Objective:** Find all powers of 8 (\\(2^3\\)) within the same range.\n- **Strategy:** Since \\(8 = 2^3\\), look for \\(2^{3m}\\) where \\(m\\) is an integer.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Finding \\(m\\):** Determine the largest \\(m\\) such that \\(2^{3m} < 1,000,000\\).\n- **Test \\(m = 6\\):** \n  - \\(2^{18} = 262,144\\) (less than 1,000,000)\n  - \\(2^{21} = 2,097,152\\) (exceeds 1,000,000)\n- **Conclusion:** \\(m = 6\\) is the largest valid exponent.\n\n**List of Powers of 8:**\n- \\(2^0 = 1\\) (since \\(8^0 = 1\\))\n- \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n- \\(2^6 = 64\\)\n- \\(2^9 = 512\\)\n- \\(2^{12} = 4,096\\)\n- \\(2^{15} = 32,768\\)\n- \\(2^{18} = 262,144\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Is the list correct?** Yes, these are all powers of 8 up to \\(2^{18}\\).\n\n**Checkpoint:**\n- **Total Count:** 7 powers of 8.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Desired Quantity**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Objective:** Determine the number of powers of 2 that are **not** powers of 8.\n- **Strategy:** Subtract the number of powers of 8 from the total number of powers of 2.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Total Powers of 2:** 20\n- **Total Powers of 8:** 7\n- **Subtracting:** \\(20 - 7 = 13\\)\n\n**But Hold On:**\n- **Quick Reflection:** Does this result make sense? It\u2019s beneficial to double-check by listing the non-powers of 8.\n\n**Listing Non-Powers of 8:**\n- **Powers of 2:** \n  - \\(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, \\ldots, 2^{19}\\)\n- **Powers of 8:** \n  - \\(2^0, 2^3, 2^6, 2^9, 2^{12}, 2^{15}, 2^{18}\\)\n- **Non-Powers of 8:** \n  - \\(2^1, 2^2, 2^4, 2^5, 2^7, 2^8, 2^{10}, 2^{11}, 2^{13}, 2^{14}, 2^{16}, 2^{17}, 2^{19}\\)\n\n**Counting Non-Powers of 8:**\n- **Total:** 13\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does the number match?** Yes, subtracting 7 from 20 yields 13, and the list confirms it.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **Is there anything I missed?** No, everything aligns perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>\nThere are **13** positive integers smaller than 1,000,000 that are powers of 2 but are not powers of 8.\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Does this answer make sense?** Yes, by systematically identifying and subtracting the overlapping powers of 8 from the total powers of 2, the result is consistent.\n- **Is there an alternative way to check?** Considering that only powers of 2 where the exponent is **not** a multiple of 3 are included, which aligns with the list and calculations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Was the initial approach correct?** Yes, starting with identifying all relevant powers and then subtracting the overlapping ones worked smoothly.\n- **Did I encounter any issues?** No major issues, but double-checking by listing ensured accuracy.\n\n**Final Verification:**\n- **Listing Approach:** Confirms the calculation.\n- **Mathematical Consistency:** No discrepancies found.\n\n---\n\n### **Complete Solution Recap**\n\nBy methodically identifying all powers of 2 less than 1,000,000 and subtracting those that are also powers of 8, the solution accurately determines that there are **13** such numbers. Throughout the process, frequent reflections and checks ensured the correctness of the approach, leading to a reliable final answer.\n\n---\n\nAlright, that's it! By integrating brainstorming, step-by-step calculations, and continuous verification, I arrived at the correct solution while maintaining a clear and coherent narrative.",
  "ground_truth": "The hint is useful because it tells us that $2^{20}$ is equal to $1024^2$, which is slightly more than $1{,}000{,}000$, but is clearly less than $2{,}000{,}000$. Therefore, the largest power of $2$ which is less than $1{,}000{,}000$ is $2^{19}$. This tells us that $20$ of the integers smaller than $1{,}000{,}000$ are powers of $2$: $$2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \\ldots, 2^{17}, 2^{18}, 2^{19}.$$\n\nHowever, we have to exclude the $7$ numbers $$2^0, 2^3, 2^6, 2^9, 2^{12}, 2^{15}, 2^{18}$$ from our count, because these are all powers of $8$ (in general, $2^{3n}$ is the same as $(2^3)^n$, which is $8^n$). That leaves us with $20-7 = \\boxed{13}$ powers of $2$ that aren't powers of $8$."
