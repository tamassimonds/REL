Here's how it would look:\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nWe're given a parabola with the equation \\( y = x^2 + bx + c \\) that passes through the points \\((-1, -11)\\) and \\((3, 17)\\). Our goal is to find the value of \\( c \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Identifying the Unknowns:** We have two unknowns in the equation: \\( b \\) and \\( c \\). Since there are two points provided, it seems logical that we can set up a system of equations to solve for both variables.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Substitution Method:** Plug the points into the equation to create two equations and solve for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n  2. **Reflection on Symmetry:** Consider using properties of parabolas, like the vertex or axis of symmetry, but that might be overthinking it for this problem.\n  3. **Matrix Approach:** Employ linear algebra to solve the system, but that feels like overkill for just two equations.\n\nGiven the simplicity of the problem, I think the **Substitution Method** is the most straightforward approach. Let's start with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI'll plug each point into the parabola equation to create two separate equations. This should give me a system to solve for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **For the point \\((-1, -11)\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   -11 = (-1)^2 + b(-1) + c \\implies -11 = 1 - b + c\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n\n   \\[\n   -11 = 1 - b + c \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -12 = -b + c \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b - c = 12 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **For the point \\((3, 17)\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   17 = (3)^2 + b(3) + c \\implies 17 = 9 + 3b + c\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n\n   \\[\n   17 = 9 + 3b + c \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 8 = 3b + c \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, by plugging in the points, I've created two linear equations with two unknowns. This should be solvable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to solve the system:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nb - c &= 12 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)} \\\\\n3b + c &= 8 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n- **Possible Methods:**\n  1. **Elimination Method:** Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable.\n  2. **Substitution Method:** Solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other.\n\nGiven the setup, the **Elimination Method** seems quicker. Let's try adding the two equations to eliminate \\( c \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:**\n\n  \\[\n  (b - c) + (3b + c) = 12 + 8 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4b = 20\n  \\]\n\n- **Solving for \\( b \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  b = \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is this correct?** Yes, adding the equations neatly eliminated \\( c \\), allowing me to solve for \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( c \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have \\( b = 5 \\), I can substitute this back into one of the original equations to solve for \\( c \\).\n\n- **Which Equation to Use?** Equation 1 looks simpler:\n\n  \\[\n  b - c = 12\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Substituting \\( b = 5 \\) into Equation 1:**\n\n  \\[\n  5 - c = 12 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c = 5 - 12 = -7\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Let's substitute \\( b = 5 \\) and \\( c = -7 \\) back into Equation 2 to verify:\n\n  \\[\n  3(5) + (-7) = 15 - 7 = 8 \\quad \\text{which matches Equation 2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Does everything check out?** Yes, both equations are satisfied with \\( b = 5 \\) and \\( c = -7 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure the solution is correct, I'll plug both \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) back into the original parabola equation and check if both given points lie on it.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **For \\((-1, -11)\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   y = (-1)^2 + 5(-1) - 7 = 1 - 5 - 7 = -11\n   \\]\n\n   - **Does it match the given point?** Yes.\n\n2. **For \\((3, 17)\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   y = (3)^2 + 5(3) - 7 = 9 + 15 - 7 = 17\n   \\]\n\n   - **Does it match the given point?** Yes.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Final Check:** Both points satisfy the parabola equation with \\( b = 5 \\) and \\( c = -7 \\). This confirms that our solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter systematically setting up and solving the equations derived from the given points, and verifying the solution by substituting back into the original equation, we find that:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{c = -7}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Alternate Strategies and Lessons Learned**\n\n**Alternate Strategies Considered:**\n\n- **Using Parabola Properties:** Initially thought about leveraging the vertex or axis of symmetry, but realized it wasn't necessary with the information provided.\n- **Matrix Approach:** Considered using matrices, but deemed it too complex for a simple two-equation system.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n- **Substitution vs. Elimination:** The elimination method proved to be more efficient in this case.\n- **Importance of Verification:** Always verifying the solution with the original equations helps catch any potential errors.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, exploring different strategies, and continuously checking the validity of each step, we ensured the correctness of our solution. This methodical approach not only leads to the correct answer but also reinforces effective problem-solving skills.\n\n---\n\nThere you have it\u2014a complete, coherent solution that maintains the original thought process while ensuring clarity and correctness.",
  "ground_truth": "We substitute these two points into the given equation to solve for $c$. Plugging in $(-1,-11)$, we get $-11=(-1)^2-1b+c\\Rightarrow -b+c=-12$. Plugging in $(3,17)$, we get $17=3^2+3b+c \\Rightarrow 3b+c=8$. In summary, we have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n-b+c&=-12\\\\\n3b+c&=8\n\\end{align*} Multiplying the first equation by 3, we have $-3b+3c=-36$. Adding the second equation to this last one, we have $(-3b+3c)+(3b+c)=-36+8 \\Rightarrow c=\\boxed{-7}$.\n\nThe parabola is graphed below: [asy]\n\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(-9,4,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nyaxis(-13,17,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn x^2+5x-7;\n\n}\n\ndraw(graph(f,-8,3), Arrows(4));\n\n[/asy]"
