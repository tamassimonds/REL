    "working_out": "**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. When I first see it, my brain is buzzing with options. We have two functions, \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\), and we're given that \\( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \\). The goal is to find the value of \\( k \\).\n\nInitially, I think this looks like a typical algebraic problem involving functions and maybe quadratic equations since both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are quadratics. Quadratics often involve finding roots, factoring, or maybe even using the quadratic formula. But here, it's not about finding roots directly; we're given a specific condition at \\( x = 10 \\).\n\nMy mind wanders to different strategies:\n\n1. **Direct Evaluation:** Plug \\( x = 10 \\) into both functions and set up the equation based on the given condition. This seems straightforward.\n   \n2. **Equating Functions:** Maybe treat \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) as equal at \\( x = 10 \\) since their difference is a constant. But wait, that's not entirely correct because their difference is given as 10, not zero.\n\n3. **Solving for \\( k \\):** Since \\( g(x) \\) involves \\( k \\), perhaps rearranging the equation to solve for \\( k \\) would work.\n\nAt this point, the **Direct Evaluation** strategy seems the most straightforward. Let's see how that goes. If it doesn't lead me to the solution, I'll reconsider and brainstorm other approaches.\n\n**Step 1: Evaluating \\( f(10) \\) and \\( g(10) \\)**\n\nI'll start by plugging \\( x = 10 \\) into both functions.\n\n\\[\nf(10) = 3(10)^2 - 2(10) + 4\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( f(10) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(10) = 3(100) - 20 + 4 = 300 - 20 + 4 = 284\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( f(10) = 284 \\).\n\nNow, let's evaluate \\( g(10) \\):\n\n\\[\ng(10) = (10)^2 - k(10) - 6 = 100 - 10k - 6\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, this involves \\( k \\), which is what we're trying to find. Alright, let's set up the equation based on the given condition.\n\n**Step 2: Setting Up the Given Condition**\n\nThe problem states that:\n\n\\[\nf(10) - g(10) = 10\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\n284 - (100 - 10k - 6) = 10\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[\n284 - 100 + 10k + 6 = 10\n\\]\n\\[\n190 + 10k = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense so far? I plugged in \\( x = 10 \\) correctly and set up the equation based on the given condition. The simplification looks right. Let's proceed to solve for \\( k \\).\n\n**Step 3: Solving for \\( k \\)**\n\nNow, let's isolate \\( k \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[\n190 + 10k = 10\n\\]\n\nSubtract 190 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n10k = 10 - 190\n\\]\n\\[\n10k = -180\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n\\[\nk = -18\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nBefore moving on, let's quickly check if this value of \\( k \\) satisfies the original condition.\n\n**Step 4: Verification**\n\nI\u2019ll plug \\( k = -18 \\) back into \\( g(10) \\) and see if the condition \\( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \\) holds true.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( g(10) \\) with \\( k = -18 \\):\n\n\\[\ng(10) = 100 - (-18)(10) - 6 = 100 + 180 - 6 = 274\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( f(10) - g(10) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(10) - g(10) = 284 - 274 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nPerfect! The condition \\( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \\) is satisfied with \\( k = -18 \\). \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe value of \\( k \\) is **-18**. \n\nThroughout the process, by directly evaluating the functions at \\( x = 10 \\) and setting up the given condition as an equation, I was able to solve for \\( k \\) efficiently. Checking the work at each step ensured the correctness of the solution.\n\n\n---\n\n**Brainstorming Different Strategies Again**\n\nI see that my initial approach worked, but let's reflect and think if there might be alternative methods to verify or perhaps make the solution more elegant.\n\n1. **Symmetry in Quadratics:** Notice that both functions are quadratics. Perhaps there's a property of quadratics that can simplify the problem.\n\n2. **Factoring Differences:** Maybe the difference \\( f(x) - g(x) \\) can be factored or simplified, providing insights into \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Graphical Interpretation:** Though not always practical without tools, considering the graphs of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) might help visualize the relationship.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Factoring Differences**\n\nLet's explore the second idea: factoring the difference between \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\).\n\nThe difference is:\n\n\\[\nf(x) - g(x) = (3x^2 - 2x + 4) - (x^2 - kx - 6) = 2x^2 + (k - 2)x + 10\n\\]\n\nWait a second, this looks like a quadratic in itself. Perhaps we can set this equal to some multiple of the difference \\( f(x) - g(x) \\) to find relationships between coefficients.\n\nBut then, considering that \\( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \\), and with \\( x = 10 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n2(10)^2 + (k - 2)(10) + 10 = 10\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n200 + 10k - 20 + 10 = 10\n\\]\n\\[\n190 + 10k = 10\n\\]\n\n\\(\\hspace{2.5cm}\\) **Wait, this is exactly the same equation we got before!**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms that the initial approach is correct. Factoring the difference didn't lead to a new solution but reassured that the equation was set up correctly.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nGiven that both methods lead to the same equation:\n\n\\[\n190 + 10k = 10\n\\]\n\\[\n10k = -180\n\\]\n\\[\nk = -18\n\\]\n\nAnd verifying \\( k = -18 \\) satisfies the original condition, it's clear that the solution is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nEven by exploring different strategies, we've consistently arrived at the same solution: \\( k = -18 \\). This reinforces the validity of the approach and ensures confidence in the answer.\n\nOverall, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the solution led to a robust and correct answer.",
