  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem. I\u2019ll keep my original good insights but also integrate new strategies to correct the errors I made earlier. I'll naturally walk through my thought process, catching mistakes, and adjusting my approach\u2014just like solving it step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, we have the function:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sqrt{x(50 - x)} + \\sqrt{x(2 - x)}\n\\]\n\ndefined for \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 2\\). We need to find the maximum value \\(M\\) of \\(f(x)\\) and the point \\(x = x_0\\) where this maximum occurs. Essentially, we're looking for \\((x_0, M)\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This looks like an optimization problem.\n- The function involves square roots, which might suggest symmetry or a neat geometric interpretation.\n- Maybe calculus (derivatives) could help, but perhaps there's a simpler way given the limited domain.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Graphical Insight:** Sketching the function to get a visual idea.\n2. **Calculus Approach:** Using the derivative to find critical points.\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Simplifying the expression to see if patterns emerge.\n4. **Symmetry Consideration:** Checking if the function is symmetric, which could simplify finding the maximum.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Given the restricted domain \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 2\\), perhaps evaluating the function at key points might be sufficient.\n- It might be overkill to use calculus if the maximum is at an endpoint or a straightforward point within the domain.\n\nAlright, let's start with **Strategy 1: Graphical Insight** to get an initial feel.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Graphical Insight**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let\u2019s try to visualize what \\(f(x)\\) looks like.\n- Maybe plotting a few points will give us an idea of where the maximum occurs.\n\n**Calculating Key Points:**\n- **At \\(x = 0\\):**\n  \\[\n  f(0) = \\sqrt{0 \\times 50} + \\sqrt{0 \\times 2} = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **At \\(x = 2\\):**\n  \\[\n  f(2) = \\sqrt{2 \\times 48} + \\sqrt{2 \\times 0} = \\sqrt{96} = 4\\sqrt{6} \\approx 9.796\n  \\]\n  \n- **At \\(x = 1\\):**\n  \\[\n  f(1) = \\sqrt{1 \\times 49} + \\sqrt{1 \\times 1} = 7 + 1 = 8\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- Hmm, at \\(x = 1\\), \\(f(x) = 8\\), and at \\(x = 2\\), \\(f(x) \\approx 9.796\\).\n- So far, it seems like the function is increasing towards \\(x = 2\\).\n- But is \\(x = 2\\) really the maximum? Let's check further by testing another point closer to \\(x = 2\\).\n\n**Testing \\(x = 1.5\\):**\n\\[\nf(1.5) = \\sqrt{1.5 \\times 48.5} + \\sqrt{1.5 \\times 0.5} \\approx 8.531 + 0.866 \\approx 9.397\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- \\(f(1.5) \\approx 9.397\\), which is less than \\(f(2) \\approx 9.796\\).\n- This suggests that the maximum might indeed be at \\(x = 2\\).\n\n**Graphical Conclusion:**\n- Based on these points, it seems like \\(f(x)\\) increases as \\(x\\) approaches 2 within the given domain.\n\n---\n\n### **Wait a Minute... Realizing an Oversight**\n\n**Realization:**\n- Actually, looking at this again, the maximum might not necessarily be at an endpoint. Perhaps there's a point within the domain where \\(f(x)\\) reaches its maximum.\n- Maybe I need to consider other strategies to be sure.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The endpoint analysis seems straightforward, but I might be missing something deeper. Let's explore other methods to confirm.\n\nAlright, let's move on to **Strategy 2: Calculus Approach** to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Calculus Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To confirm whether \\(x = 2\\) is the maximum, let's use calculus to find critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.\n\n**Calculating the Derivative:**\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sqrt{x(50 - x)} + \\sqrt{x(2 - x)}\n\\]\n  \nLet\u2019s denote:\n\\[\nu = \\sqrt{x(50 - x)},\\quad v = \\sqrt{x(2 - x)}\n\\]\n  \nTherefore,\n\\[\nf(x) = u + v\n\\]\n  \nTaking the derivative:\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{du}{dx} + \\frac{dv}{dx}\n\\]\n  \nCalculating \\(\\frac{du}{dx}\\):\n\\[\nu = (x(50-x))^{1/2}\n\\]\n  \nUsing the chain rule:\n\\[\n\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}(x(50-x))^{-1/2} \\times (50 - 2x) = \\frac{50 - 2x}{2\\sqrt{x(50-x)}}\n\\]\n  \nSimilarly, for \\(v\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dv}{dx} = \\frac{1 - x}{\\sqrt{x(2-x)}}\n\\]\n  \nSo,\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{50 - 2x}{2\\sqrt{x(50-x)}} + \\frac{1 - x}{\\sqrt{x(2-x)}}\n\\]\n  \n**Setting \\(f'(x) = 0\\):**\n\\[\n\\frac{50 - 2x}{2\\sqrt{x(50-x)}} + \\frac{1 - x}{\\sqrt{x(2-x)}} = 0\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- Hmm, this equation looks complicated to solve analytically.\n- Maybe there's a better way to approach this or simplify the problem.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n- Let's see if we can factor or manipulate the equation to make it easier.\n\n**Rearranging:**\n\\[\n\\frac{50 - 2x}{2\\sqrt{x(50-x)}} = -\\frac{1 - x}{\\sqrt{x(2-x)}}\n\\]\n  \nCross-multiplying:\n\\[\n(50 - 2x)\\sqrt{x(2 - x)} = -2(1 - x)\\sqrt{x(50 - x)}\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- Still messy. Perhaps this isn't the most efficient path.\n\n**Check:**\n- Given that the derivative approach is getting complicated, maybe it's better to consider another strategy.\n\nAlright, since calculus isn't providing a clear path, let's try **Strategy 3: Algebraic Manipulation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Algebraic Manipulation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's try to simplify the original function to see if any patterns emerge.\n- Maybe factoring or completing the square could help.\n\n**Simplifying \\(f(x)\\):**\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sqrt{x(50 - x)} + \\sqrt{x(2 - x)}\n\\]\n  \nAttempting to factor out \\(\\sqrt{x}\\):\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sqrt{x}(\\sqrt{50 - x} + \\sqrt{2 - x})\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- Factoring out \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) doesn\u2019t immediately reveal anything useful.\n- No obvious simplification or pattern emerges.\n\n**Check:**\n- This path doesn't seem to lead to an easy solution.\n\nHmm, algebraic manipulation isn't helping either. Let's consider **Strategy 4: Symmetry Consideration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 4: Symmetry Consideration**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The function involves terms with \\((50 - x)\\) and \\((2 - x)\\).\n- Given the domain is \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 2\\), perhaps there's symmetry we can exploit.\n\n**Analyzing Symmetry:**\n- However, the large constant 50 outside the domain might not directly contribute to symmetry within \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 2\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Symmetry might not be immediately helpful here since the maximum seems to occur at an endpoint.\n\n**Check:**\n- This strategy doesn't provide additional insights.\n\nAlright, since none of these strategies are yielding a clear answer, maybe I need to think differently. **Wait a minute, I think I see where I went wrong...** Perhaps a more advanced approach is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Introducing a New Strategy: Applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Actually, looking at this again, maybe I can apply the **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality** to bound \\(f(x)\\) and find the maximum value.\n- This reminds me of problems where inequalities help simplify and provide exact bounds.\n\n**Applying Cauchy-Schwarz:**\n\\[\n\\left[ \\sqrt{x(50 - x)} + \\sqrt{x(2 - x)} \\right]^2 \\leq \\left[ (x + (2 - x))((50 - x) + x) \\right] = 100\n\\]\n  \nSo,\n\\[\nf(x) \\leq 10\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- Hmm, this inequality suggests that the maximum value of \\(f(x)\\) is 10.\n- But does \\(f(x)\\) actually reach 10? Let's check when equality holds in Cauchy-Schwarz.\n\n**Condition for Equality:**\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2 - x} = \\frac{50 - x}{x}\n\\]\n  \nCross-multiplying:\n\\[\nx^2 = (2 - x)(50 - x) = x^2 - 52x + 100\n\\]\n  \nSimplifying:\n\\[\n52x = 100 \\implies x = \\frac{100}{52} = \\frac{25}{13} \\approx 1.923\n\\]\n  \n**Calculating \\(f\\left(\\frac{25}{13}\\right)\\):**\n- To verify, let's plug \\(x = \\frac{25}{13}\\) back into \\(f(x)\\) and see if it equals 10.\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{25}{13}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{13}\\left(50 - \\frac{25}{13}\\right)} + \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{13}\\left(2 - \\frac{25}{13}\\right)}\n\\]\n  \nCalculating:\n\\[\n50 - \\frac{25}{13} = \\frac{625}{13},\\quad 2 - \\frac{25}{13} = \\frac{1}{13}\n\\]\n  \nSo,\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{25}{13}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{25 \\times 625}{169}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{25 \\times 1}{169}} = \\frac{25}{13} \\times 5 + \\frac{5}{13} = 10\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- Oh! This confirms that \\(f(x)\\) reaches its maximum value of 10 at \\(x = \\frac{25}{13}\\).\n- **Aha moment:** The maximum isn't at the endpoint \\(x = 2\\) as I initially thought, but rather at \\(x = \\frac{25}{13}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Strategy: Correcting the Initial Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now that I've identified the correct maximum using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, let's re-evaluate the initial strategies and see where I can integrate this insight.\n\n**Revisiting Strategy 1: Graphical Insight**\n- **Initial Mistake:** I only tested integer points and endpoints, missing the actual maximum within the domain.\n- **Correction:** Including \\(x = \\frac{25}{13} \\approx 1.923\\) provides the true maximum.\n\n**Revisiting Strategy 2: Calculus Approach**\n- **Initial Mistake:** The derivative approach became too complicated, leading me away from the correct solution.\n- **Correction:** Recognizing that setting the derivative to zero corresponds to the condition for equality in Cauchy-Schwarz simplifies finding the critical point.\n\n**Revisiting Strategy 3: Algebraic Manipulation**\n- **Initial Mistake:** Factoring out \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) didn't reveal useful information.\n- **Correction:** Applying inequalities instead of direct manipulation leads to better insights.\n\n**Revisiting Strategy 4: Symmetry Consideration**\n- **Initial Mistake:** Assuming symmetry based on endpoints was insufficient.\n- **Correction:** Understanding that symmetry in the inequality conditions helps locate the maximum.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>\\left(\\frac{25}{13}, 10\\right)</ANSWER>\\)\n\n**Ordered Pair:**\n\\((x_0, M) = \\left(\\frac{25}{13}, 10\\right)\\)\n\n**Approximate Value:**\n\\((1.923, 10)\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n1. **Initial Brainstorming:**\n   - Considered multiple strategies: graphical insight, calculus, algebraic manipulation, and symmetry.\n   - Initially leaned towards graphical insight by evaluating key points.\n\n2. **Graphical Insight:**\n   - Calculated \\(f(x)\\) at \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = 1\\), \\(x = 1.5\\), and \\(x = 2\\).\n   - Observed increasing values towards \\(x = 2\\) but missed the actual maximum within the domain.\n\n3. **Calculus Approach:**\n   - Attempted to find critical points using the derivative but faced complexity.\n   - Abandoned this approach initially but later realized that setting the derivative to zero aligns with the equality condition in Cauchy-Schwarz.\n\n4. **Algebraic Manipulation:**\n   - Tried simplifying the function by factoring but didn't gain useful insights.\n   \n5. **Symmetry Consideration:**\n   - Explored potential symmetry but found it unhelpful without applying inequalities.\n\n6. **Introducing Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:**\n   - Applied Cauchy-Schwarz to bound \\(f(x)\\) and identified the maximum value.\n   - Determined the exact point \\(x = \\frac{25}{13}\\) where \\(f(x) = 10\\).\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - Plugged \\(x = \\frac{25}{13}\\) back into \\(f(x)\\) to confirm that the maximum value is indeed 10.\n   - Ensured that all strategies align with this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer Recap**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>\\left(\\frac{25}{13}, 10\\right)</ANSWER>\\)\n\n**Ordered Pair:**\n\\((x_0, M) = \\left(\\frac{25}{13}, 10\\right)\\)\n\n**Approximate Value:**\n\\((1.923, 10)\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy initially exploring various strategies and realizing that endpoint analysis alone was insufficient, I integrated the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to accurately determine the maximum value of \\(f(x)\\). This approach led me to identify the correct maximum point within the domain, correcting the earlier oversight. Reflecting on the initial strategies and incorporating advanced techniques ensured a precise and reliable solution.",
  "ground_truth": "By Cauchy-Schwarz,\n\\[\\left[ \\sqrt{x(50 - x)} + \\sqrt{(2 - x)x} \\right]^2 \\le [(x + (2 - x))((50 - x) + x)] = 100,\\]so $f(x) \\le 10.$\n\nEquality occurs when\n\\[\\frac{x}{2 - x} = \\frac{50 - x}{x}.\\]Cross-multiplying, we get $x^2 = (2 - x)(50 - x) = x^2 - 52x + 100,$ so $x = \\frac{100}{52} = \\frac{25}{13}.$\n\nThus, $(x_0,M) = \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{25}{13}, 10 \\right)}.$"
