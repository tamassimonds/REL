    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were working on it myself.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{x} + \\sqrt[3]{20 - x} = 2\n\\]\n\nI think, \"This looks like a problem involving cube roots and maybe some algebraic manipulation.\" My initial instinct is to try and isolate one of the cube roots or perhaps cube both sides to eliminate the roots. However, I'm not entirely sure if that's the best approach right off the bat.\n\nAnother thought is to consider substituting variables to simplify the equation. For example, letting \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{x}\\) could make things easier. But then I wonder if that complicates the equation further.\n\nI also recall that equations involving cube roots can sometimes be solved using symmetry or by recognizing certain patterns. Maybe there's a way to relate the two cube roots that I'm not seeing immediately.\n\nOverall, I'm feeling a bit uncertain about the initial approach\u2014should I attempt to cube both sides, or is substitution a better starting point? Let me brainstorm and see which method seems more promising.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Cube Both Sides:**  \n   - Pros: Directly eliminates the cube roots, making the equation simpler.\n   - Cons: Might lead to a higher-degree polynomial that's messy to solve.\n\n2. **Substitution Approach:**  \n   - Letting \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{x}\\), so the equation becomes \\(y + \\sqrt[3]{20 - y^3} = 2\\).\n   - Pros: Simplifies the equation by changing variables.\n   - Cons: Still involves cube roots, which might not be straightforward.\n\n3. **Symmetry Consideration:**  \n   - The equation is symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(20 - x\\), which might hint at solutions being related.\n   - Pros: Could lead to identifying solutions without full algebraic expansion.\n   - Cons: Might not be straightforward to implement.\n\n4. **Graphical Insight:**  \n   - Plotting the functions to visually identify intersections.\n   - Pros: Provides a visual understanding.\n   - Cons: Not precise and doesn't help with finding exact values needed for \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\nAt this point, cubing both sides seems like a straightforward approach, but I'm wary of ending up with a complicated polynomial. Perhaps combining this with substitution might streamline the process. Let me try starting with substitution to see if that simplifies things.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Substitution**\n\nLet's substitute \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{x}\\). Then, the original equation becomes:\n\n\\[\ny + \\sqrt[3]{20 - y^3} = 2\n\\]\n\nNow, isolate \\(\\sqrt[3]{20 - y^3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{20 - y^3} = 2 - y\n\\]\n\nThis looks more manageable. It suggests that the cube of \\(2 - y\\) might relate to \\(20 - y^3\\). But before jumping to conclusions, let's explore further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Cubing Both Sides**\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt[3]{20 - y^3} = 2 - y\\), let's cube both sides to eliminate the cube root:\n\n\\[\n20 - y^3 = (2 - y)^3\n\\]\n\nNow, expand the right side:\n\n\\[\n(2 - y)^3 = 2^3 - 3 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot y + 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot y^2 - y^3 = 8 - 12y + 6y^2 - y^3\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n20 - y^3 = 8 - 12y + 6y^2 - y^3\n\\]\n\nWait a second... The \\(y^3\\) terms on both sides cancel out:\n\n\\[\n20 = 8 - 12y + 6y^2\n\\]\n\nLet me pause and reflect\u2014this simplifies nicely. It suggests that there's a quadratic relationship between \\(y\\) and the constants. Let's proceed to rearrange it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Rearranging the Equation**\n\nRearrange the equation to bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n6y^2 - 12y + 8 - 20 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n6y^2 - 12y - 12 = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, I notice that all coefficients can be divided by 6 to simplify the equation:\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 2y - 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis looks much cleaner. Now, let's solve this quadratic equation for \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\nUse the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -2\\), and \\(c = -2\\):\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-2)}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 8}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\(\\sqrt{12}\\):\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the two possible values for \\(y\\) are:\n\n\\[\ny = 1 + \\sqrt{3} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = 1 - \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nAlright, let's reflect\u2014these are real values, which makes sense given the problem context. Now, recall that \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{x}\\), so we need to find the corresponding \\(x\\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Corresponding \\(x\\) Values**\n\nSince \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{x}\\), we have:\n\n1. For \\(y = 1 + \\sqrt{3}\\):\n   \\[\n   x = (1 + \\sqrt{3})^3\n   \\]\n   \n2. For \\(y = 1 - \\sqrt{3}\\):\n   \\[\n   x = (1 - \\sqrt{3})^3\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute these \\(x\\) values one by one.\n\n---\n\n#### **Calculation for \\(x = (1 + \\sqrt{3})^3\\)**\n\nFirst, expand \\((1 + \\sqrt{3})^3\\):\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\sqrt{3})^3 = 1^3 + 3 \\cdot 1^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{3} + 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (\\sqrt{3})^2 + (\\sqrt{3})^3\n\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n- \\(1^3 = 1\\)\n- \\(3 \\cdot 1^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 3\\sqrt{3}\\)\n- \\(3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9\\)\n- \\((\\sqrt{3})^3 = 3\\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n\\[\n1 + 3\\sqrt{3} + 9 + 3\\sqrt{3} = 10 + 6\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(x = 10 + 6\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n#### **Reflection: Does This Make Sense?**\n\nThe expression \\(10 + 6\\sqrt{3}\\) is positive, which is reasonable since \\(x\\) represents a real number in the original equation. The cube of a positive number is also positive, aligning with our calculations.\n\n---\n\n#### **Calculation for \\(x = (1 - \\sqrt{3})^3\\)**\n\nNow, expand \\((1 - \\sqrt{3})^3\\):\n\n\\[\n(1 - \\sqrt{3})^3 = 1^3 - 3 \\cdot 1^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{3} + 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (\\sqrt{3})^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^3\n\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n- \\(1^3 = 1\\)\n- \\(-3 \\cdot 1^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = -3\\sqrt{3}\\)\n- \\(3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 9\\)\n- \\(-(\\sqrt{3})^3 = -3\\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n\\[\n1 - 3\\sqrt{3} + 9 - 3\\sqrt{3} = 10 - 6\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(x = 10 - 6\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n#### **Reflection: Does This Make Sense?**\n\nThe expression \\(10 - 6\\sqrt{3}\\) involves subtracting a multiple of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) from 10. Since \\(\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732\\), calculating \\(6 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\approx 10.392\\). Therefore, \\(10 - 10.392 \\approx -0.392\\), which is negative.\n\nThis negative value makes sense in the context of the original equation. Since \\(x\\) can be any real number, having \\(x = 10 - 6\\sqrt{3}\\) as a solution is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Identifying the Smaller Value**\n\nWe have two \\(x\\) values:\n\n1. \\(x = 10 + 6\\sqrt{3}\\)\n2. \\(x = 10 - 6\\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nClearly, \\(10 - 6\\sqrt{3}\\) is smaller. To express it in the form \\(p - \\sqrt{q}\\), let's rewrite it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Expressing the Smaller Value as \\(p - \\sqrt{q}\\)**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\nx = 10 - 6\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nWe can express this as:\n\n\\[\nx = 10 - \\sqrt{(6\\sqrt{3})^2} = 10 - \\sqrt{108}\n\\]\n\nBut to match the form \\(p - \\sqrt{q}\\), we recognize that \\(p = 10\\) and \\(q = 108\\). However, \\(q\\) should ideally be expressed as a perfect square if possible.\n\nCalculating \\(\\sqrt{108}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{108} = \\sqrt{36 \\times 3} = 6\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression remains:\n\n\\[\nx = 10 - 6\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(p = 10\\) and \\(q = 108\\).\n\n#### **Reflection: Is This the Correct Representation?**\n\nYes, the smaller value \\(x = 10 - 6\\sqrt{3}\\) can be expressed as \\(p - \\sqrt{q}\\) with \\(p = 10\\) and \\(q = 108\\). This satisfies the condition given in the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Computing \\(p + q\\)**\n\nNow, compute:\n\n\\[\np + q = 10 + 108 = 118\n\\]\n\n#### **Final Check**\n\nLet me quickly verify:\n\n- The substitution and cubing steps were logically sound.\n- The quadratic equation was simplified correctly.\n- The cubic expansions were accurate.\n- The determination of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) aligns with the required form.\n\nEverything checks out, so the final answer is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming and exploring different strategies, starting with substitution led to a straightforward path:\n\n1. **Substitution:** Simplified the original equation.\n2. **Cubing Both Sides:** Eliminated cube roots and simplified to a quadratic equation.\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equation:** Found the two possible \\(y\\) values.\n4. **Finding Corresponding \\(x\\) Values:** Determined the cube of those \\(y\\) values to get \\(x\\).\n5. **Identifying Smaller Value:** Recognized and expressed the smaller \\(x\\) value in the desired form.\n6. **Computing \\(p + q\\):** Found the sum of constants to arrive at the final answer.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{118}\n\\]",

Factoring,\\[a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)((a+b)^2-3ab) = 2(4-3ab)= 8-6ab=20 \\Longrightarrow ab = -2\\]\nSolving $a+b=2, ab=-2$ gives us the quadratic $a^2 - 2a - 2 = 0$.
