  "solution": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem naturally, exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and ensuring everything checks out\u2014just like solving it on paper. Here's how I approached it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, the question asks how much cheaper Penny Wise's price is compared to Super Savers for Camera \\( X \\). Both stores offer discounts off the same list price of \\$39.96:\n\n- **Super Savers:** \\$9 off\n- **Penny Wise:** 25% off\n\nImmediately, I think about comparing absolute discounts (\\$9) to percentage discounts (25%). But to make sure, let\u2019s brainstorm different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Calculate Final Prices for Both Stores**\n\n- **Thought:** By finding the sale price at each store, I can directly see the difference.\n\n**Strategy 2: Compare Discounts Directly**\n\n- **Thought:** Maybe compare the \\$9 discount to the 25% discount without calculating final prices. However, since one is in dollars and the other in percentage, it might get tricky.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nStrategy 1 seems more straightforward\u2014calculating the final prices first makes sense. Let\u2019s go with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Sale Price at Super Savers**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- List price: \\$39.96\n- Discount: \\$9 off\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sale Price at Super Savers} = \\$39.96 - \\$9\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\$39.96 - \\$9 = \\$30.96\n\\]\n\n**Checking Work:**\n\n- Quick check: \\$39.96 minus \\$9 equals \\$30.96. That\u2019s correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Sale Price at Penny Wise**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- List price: \\$39.96\n- Discount: 25% off\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discount Amount} = 25\\% \\times \\$39.96\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n0.25 \\times \\$39.96 = \\$9.99\n\\]\n\n**Sale Price at Penny Wise:**\n\n\\[\n\\$39.96 - \\$9.99 = \\$29.97\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Hmm, subtracting \\$9.99 from \\$39.96 gives \\$29.97. Does a 25% discount being \\$9.99 make sense? Yes, because 25% is a quarter of the price, and \\$9.99 is roughly a quarter of \\$39.96. So, it checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Price Difference**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Find how much cheaper Penny Wise\u2019s price is compared to Super Savers.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price Difference} = \\$30.96 - \\$29.97\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\$30.96 - \\$29.97 = \\$0.99\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- So, Penny Wise is \\$0.99 cheaper than Super Savers. That\u2019s less than a dollar, which seems plausible given the discounts.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Quick Sanity Check:**\n\n- Super Savers offers a flat \\$9 off, while Penny Wise offers a 25% discount amounting to \\$9.99. Since \\$9.99 is slightly more than \\$9, it makes sense that Penny Wise's final price is slightly lower.\n\n- **Does That Make Sense?** Yes, because a larger discount leads to a lower final price.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything adds up correctly. The calculations make sense, and the final price difference aligns with the logic of the discounts provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>Penny Wise's price is 99 cents cheaper than Super Savers'.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming Helped:** Exploring different strategies ensured I chose the most straightforward path.\n\n- **Reflection and Checking:** Regularly checking each step prevented errors and confirmed the correctness of the approach.\n\n- **Natural Flow:** Thinking aloud and questioning each part of the process made the solution robust and helped catch potential mistakes early on.\n\n---\n\n**Recap:** By calculating the final prices at both stores and comparing them, I determined that Penny Wise's price is 99 cents cheaper than Super Savers'. Regular reflections and checks ensured the accuracy of each step.\n\nThere we go! By approaching the problem step-by-step, reflecting often, and checking my work like I naturally would, I arrived at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "The price at Super Savers is $\\$39.96-\\$9=\\$30.96.$ The price at Penny Wise is $0.75(\\$39.96)=\\$29.97.$ Thus the difference is $\\$30.96-\\$29.97=\\boxed{99}$ cents."
