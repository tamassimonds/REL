    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through it as naturally as possible, mimicking real human thought processes. This means brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on whether each approach is correct, checking work frequently, and being open to changing directions if something feels off. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\n**First Reaction:**\n\nOkay, so we have a point \\((3,6)\\) that's on the graph of \\(y = g(x)\\). Then, \\(h(x) = (g(x))^2\\). The question asks for a point that must be on the graph of \\(y = h(x)\\), and we're supposed to find the sum of its coordinates.\n\n**What's Striking Me:**\n\n- The relationship between \\(h(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) involves squaring \\(g(x)\\). That seems straightforward.\n- I remember that squaring a function might involve dealing with positive and negative values, but here we only have one point given.\n- The point \\((3,6)\\) suggests that when \\(x = 3\\), \\(g(3) = 6\\).\n- It feels like I need to find another \\(x\\) where \\(h(x)\\) is defined and relates back to \\(g(x)\\).\n\n**Uncertainty:**\n\n- Wait, do I need to find another point on \\(g(x)\\), or am I only dealing with the given point?\n- How exactly does squaring \\(g(x)\\) affect the coordinates of \\(h(x)\\)?\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Substitution Approach:** Use the given point to find \\(h(3)\\) and see if that gives me another point on \\(h(x)\\).\n2. **General Function Relationship:** Consider how squaring \\(g(x)\\) affects its graph to maybe identify other points.\n3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Think about how the coordinates transform when moving from \\(g(x)\\) to \\(h(x)\\).\n\nI think starting with **Direct Substitution** makes the most sense because we have a specific point on \\(g(x)\\). If that doesn't lead anywhere, I'll explore the other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Direct Substitution Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince \\((3,6)\\) is on \\(g(x)\\), it means \\(g(3) = 6\\). Let's see how this relates to \\(h(x)\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[ h(3) = (g(3))^2 = 6^2 = 36 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, so \\(h(3) = 36\\). This gives us the point \\((3,36)\\) on the graph of \\(h(x)\\).\n\n**Checking:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because \\(h(x)\\) is defined as the square of \\(g(x)\\), and squaring 6 gives 36. Seems correct so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Required Point**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe problem asks for a point that **must** be on the graph of \\(y = h(x)\\). So far, we've found \\((3,36)\\). But the wording suggests there might be more to consider\u2014perhaps another point due to the nature of squaring the function.\n\n**Idea:**\n\nMaybe considering negative values is essential here. Since squaring a value results in a positive, perhaps \\(g(-3) = -6\\) could also be a point if \\(g(x)\\) is an odd function. But we don't know if \\(g(x)\\) is odd; we only have one point.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\nWait a moment\u2014there's no indication that \\(g(x)\\) is odd, and we can't assume \\(g(-3) = -6\\). Therefore, bringing in negative values doesn't seem justified with the given information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt appears that the only point we can definitively assign to \\(h(x)\\) based on the given information is \\((3,36)\\).\n\n**Checking:**\n\nDoes this align with the problem's requirements? Yes, because the problem specifies that \\(h(x) = (g(x))^2\\), and we have a concrete value from \\(g(3)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Ensuring the Found Point is Correct**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo be sure, let me double-check if squaring \\(g(3)\\) correctly translates to a point on \\(h(x)\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Given: \\(g(3) = 6\\)\n- So, \\(h(3) = 6^2 = 36\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis calculation is straightforward and matches what we expect. No inconsistencies here.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nIs \\(h(3) = 36\\) a valid point on the graph of \\(y = h(x)\\)? Yes, because the definition of \\(h(x)\\) is satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach is Complete**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI initially considered whether there might be other points due to the squaring operation, but since no additional information about \\(g(x)\\) is provided (like it being an odd function), it's safe to conclude that \\((3,36)\\) is the only point we can definitively determine.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nDoes relying solely on the given point meet the problem's requirements? Yes, because the point \\((3,36)\\) satisfies the definition of \\(h(x)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe approach seems correct. Assuming \\(g(x)\\) behaves normally (like most functions), squaring it only amplifies the existing point.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Calculating the Sum of the Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of the coordinates of the point on \\(h(x)\\). We've identified the point as \\((3,36)\\), so let's calculate the sum.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[ 3 + 36 = 39 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSimple addition here. The sum makes sense and aligns with the coordinates we've found.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nIs \\(39\\) a reasonable answer? Yes, it corresponds directly to the point \\((3,36)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying each step, the sum of the coordinates of the point that must be on the graph of \\(y = h(x)\\) is **39**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{39} \\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy starting with a straightforward substitution based on the given point, I was able to identify a specific point on \\(h(x)\\). Reflecting frequently and checking the validity of each approach ensured that the final answer was correct. Initially considering other potential points helped confirm that \\((3,36)\\) was indeed the only one determinable from the provided information. Overall, the process involved brainstorming, testing, reflecting, and verifying\u2014much like how a human problem-solver would tackle it.",
