    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming and exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking if my approach is correct before moving on.\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, the question is about finding how many even three-digit numbers less than 500 can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, with each digit being usable more than once. \n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Even Numbers:** I remember that even numbers must end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Oh wait, but the digits available are only 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. So, only 2 and 4 can be used as the last digit.\n- **Three-Digit Numbers:** The first digit must be between 1 and 4 (since the number has to be less than 500).\n- **Digits Can Repeat:** This means the same digit can appear more than once in the number.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Case-Based Approach:** Consider different cases for each digit's position (hundreds, tens, units) and count valid combinations.\n2. **Permutations with Restrictions:** Since the order matters and digits can repeat, perhaps calculating permutations with specific constraints could work.\n3. **Combining Choices for Each Digit:** Multiply the number of choices available for each digit position.\n\nAt this point, the **Combining Choices for Each Digit** approach seems straightforward. That would involve calculating the number of valid options for each digit position and multiplying them together.\n\n### **Step 1: Determining the Last Digit (Units Place)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The number must be even, so the last digit has to be 2 or 4 (since those are the only even digits available).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Options for the Last Digit:** 2, 4\n\nSo, there are **2** choices for the last digit.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- This makes sense because we're only considering the available digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and among them, only 2 and 4 are even.\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the First Digit (Hundreds Place)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The number must be less than 500, so the first digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Options for the First Digit:** 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nThus, there are **4** choices for the first digit.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- This aligns with the requirement that the number is less than 500. Including 4 as an option is correct because a number starting with 4 and followed by any valid digits (including even ones) would still be under 500.\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Second Digit (Tens Place)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- There are no specific restrictions on the tens place aside from using the available digits with repetition allowed.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Options for the Second Digit:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nSo, there are **5** choices for the second digit.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- It seems logical since repetition is allowed, and any of the available digits can occupy the tens place.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Total Number of Valid Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, multiply the number of choices for each digit position to find the total number of even three-digit numbers less than 500.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Total Combinations} = (\\text{Choices for First Digit}) \\times (\\text{Choices for Second Digit}) \\times (\\text{Choices for Last Digit}) = 4 \\times 5 \\times 2 = 40\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **40** seems like a reasonable number. Each combination of first and second digits (20 total) can pair with an even last digit (2 options), leading to 40 unique numbers.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let me double-check if each step makes sense and whether all constraints are satisfied.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **First Digit:** Choices are 1-4, ensuring the number is less than 500.\n- **Second Digit:** All five digits are valid, and repetition is allowed.\n- **Last Digit:** Only even digits (2 and 4) are considered.\n\nEverything checks out. The approach is consistent with the problem's requirements.\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Correctness**\n\n**Possible Concerns:**\n- **Overcounting or Underaccounting?** The multiplication approach assumes independence between digit positions, which seems valid here since repetition is allowed.\n- **Invalid Combinations?** All generated numbers will be three-digit, even, and less than 500, fitting the criteria perfectly.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- The strategy seems solid, and quick checks at each step confirm its validity. Therefore, I\u2019m confident that the total number of valid even three-digit numbers less than 500 is **40**.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the calculations, the total number of even three-digit numbers less than 500 that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (with repetition allowed) is **40**.",

  "ground_truth": "There are four choices for the hundreds digit: 1, 2, 3, or 4. The tens digit is unrestricted; it could be any one of the five. Finally, the units digit can only be a 2 or 4. Thus, there are $4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{40}$ such numbers that can be formed."
