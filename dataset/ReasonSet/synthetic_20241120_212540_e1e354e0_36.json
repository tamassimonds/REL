    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, exploring different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nHow many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) intercepts of the curve \\( y = (x-3)^2 (x+2) \\)?\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see this problem, my initial reaction is to identify the **intercepts** of the given curve since they will serve as the vertices of the triangle. Specifically, the **\\( x \\)-intercepts** are where the curve crosses the \\( x \\)-axis (\\( y = 0 \\)), and the **\\( y \\)-intercept** is where the curve crosses the \\( y \\)-axis (\\( x = 0 \\)).\n\nWith these intercepts, I can plot the vertices of the triangle and then compute its area. But before diving in, let's brainstorm the steps involved:\n\n1. **Find the \\( x \\)-intercepts**: Solve \\( (x-3)^2 (x+2) = 0 \\).\n2. **Find the \\( y \\)-intercept**: Evaluate \\( y \\) when \\( x = 0 \\).\n3. **Determine the vertices of the triangle**: Collect the intercept points.\n4. **Calculate the area of the triangle**: Use an appropriate formula based on the coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the \\( x \\)-Intercepts**\n\nTo find the \\( x \\)-intercepts, set \\( y = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n(y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)) \\Rightarrow (x-3)^2 (x+2) = 0\n\\]\n\nI notice that this is a **product of factors**, so the equation holds zero when any factor is zero:\n\n- \\( (x-3)^2 = 0 \\) \u27f9 \\( x = 3 \\)\n- \\( x+2 = 0 \\) \u27f9 \\( x = -2 \\)\n\nSo, the \\( x \\)-intercepts are:\n\n\\[\n(x_1, y_1) = (3, 0) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (x_2, y_2) = (-2, 0)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** That was straightforward. Having two distinct \\( x \\)-intercepts makes sense for a cubic polynomial like this one.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the \\( y \\)-Intercept**\n\nNext, let's find the \\( y \\)-intercept by setting \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\ny = (0-3)^2 (0+2) = 9 \\times 2 = 18\n\\]\n\nSo, the \\( y \\)-intercept is:\n\n\\[\n(x_3, y_3) = (0, 18)\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Plugging \\( x = 0 \\) back into the equation, the calculations confirm \\( y = 18 \\). That seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Vertices of the Triangle**\n\nNow, we have the vertices of the triangle:\n\n- \\( A = (3, 0) \\)\n- \\( B = (-2, 0) \\)\n- \\( C = (0, 18) \\)\n\n**Thoughts:** These points make sense\u2014two on the \\( x \\)-axis and one on the \\( y \\)-axis\u2014forming a right triangle.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Area of the Triangle**\n\nGiven that the triangle's base lies along the \\( x \\)-axis from \\( x = -2 \\) to \\( x = 3 \\), and the height extends up to \\( y = 18 \\) at \\( x = 0 \\), we can use the area formula for a right triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's determine the **base length**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Base} = 3 - (-2) = 5\n\\]\n\nAnd the **height** is \\( 18 \\).\n\nSo, the area is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 18 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 90 = 45 \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** The calculations seem straightforward. However, let's briefly consider whether there's a better method to confirm this or if another approach might yield the same result.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternate Approach: Using the Determinant Formula**\n\nTo verify, let's use the **determinant formula** for the area of a triangle given its vertices \\((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nPlugging in our vertices:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 3(0 - 18) + (-2)(18 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 3(-18) + (-2)(18) \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| -54 - 36 \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\times 90 = 45 \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** The alternate method confirms our initial calculation. Both approaches agree, which reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the triangle is \\(\\boxed{45}\\) square units.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically identifying the intercepts of the curve and calculating the area using both the basic geometric formula and the determinant method, we've confidently determined that the area of the triangle is 45 square units. Checking our work with different methods ensures accuracy and reinforces our understanding of the problem.\n\nWhenever faced with such problems, it's beneficial to explore multiple strategies and verify results through cross-checking to ensure correctness.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5\\cdot 18=\\boxed{45}$."
