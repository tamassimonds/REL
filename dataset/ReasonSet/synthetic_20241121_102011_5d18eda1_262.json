  "problem": "How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$",
  "solution": "Sure, let's put this together into a cohesive, complete solution that mirrors a natural thinking process while maintaining clarity and correctness. I'll retain the essential elements of brainstorming, checking, and reflecting, just as someone would when solving a problem step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The equation given is:\n\n\\[\n(x-2)^{(25-x^2)} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis looks like an exponential equation where the base is \\(x-2\\) and the exponent is \\(25-x^2\\). Our goal is to find all integer values of \\(x\\) that satisfy this equation.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**  \n- **Set the Exponent to Zero:** Since any non-zero base raised to the power of zero is 1, perhaps \\(25-x^2 = 0\\).\n- **Set the Base to One:** If the base is 1, any exponent will yield 1.\n- **Set the Base to Negative One with Even Exponent:** \\((-1)\\) raised to an even exponent also equals 1.\n- **Consider Other Cases:** Maybe there are other combinations where the base and exponent result in 1.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nExploring each strategy one by one seems like a logical approach. If one method doesn't yield all solutions, I'll pivot to another.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting the Exponent to Zero**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's start by considering when the exponent is zero because any non-zero number raised to the power of zero is 1.\n\n\\[\n25 - x^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\):**\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 25  \n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = 5 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -5\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n- For \\(x = 5\\): \\((5-2)^{(25-25)} = 3^0 = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- For \\(x = -5\\): \\((-5-2)^{(25-25)} = (-7)^0 = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth solutions work perfectly. So, \\(x = 5\\) and \\(x = -5\\) are valid.\n\n**Progress So Far:**  \nTwo solutions found: \\(x = 5\\) and \\(x = -5\\). But there might be more, so let's keep exploring.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting the Base to One**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNext, consider when the base is 1 because 1 raised to any power is always 1.\n\n\\[\nx - 2 = 1  \n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n- For \\(x = 3\\): \\((3-2)^{(25-9)} = 1^{16} = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis solution works too! Therefore, \\(x = 3\\) is another valid solution.\n\n**Progress So Far:**  \nNow, we have three solutions: \\(x = -5, 3, 5\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting the Base to Negative One with Even Exponent**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's consider when the base is -1 because \\((-1)\\) raised to an even exponent equals 1.\n\n\\[\nx - 2 = -1  \n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n- For \\(x = 1\\): \\((1-2)^{(25-1)} = (-1)^{24} = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis also works! So, \\(x = 1\\) is a valid solution.\n\n**Progress So Far:**  \nAdding this to the list, we now have four solutions: \\(x = -5, 1, 3, 5\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Other Cases**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAre there any other integer values that could satisfy the equation? Perhaps when both the base and exponent are such that the result is still 1.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Base is Zero:** But \\(0\\) raised to any non-zero exponent is 0, not 1. So, this doesn't help.\n- **Higher Powers:** Given the simplicity of the equation, it's unlikely that other integer solutions exist.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI believe I've covered the main cases: exponent zero, base one, and base negative one with an even exponent. It's unlikely that other integer solutions exist.\n\n**Check:**  \nLet's list all solutions found:\n\n- \\(x = -5\\)\n- \\(x = 1\\)\n- \\(x = 3\\)\n- \\(x = 5\\)\n\n**Quick Verification:**  \nPlugging each back into the original equation confirms that they all satisfy the equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Is There Anything Missing?**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that no other integer solutions exist. Given the strategies applied, I believe all possible cases are covered.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Exponent Zero:** Captured \\(x = -5, 5\\).\n- **Base One:** Captured \\(x = 3\\).\n- **Base Negative One with Even Exponent:** Captured \\(x = 1\\).\n\nNo other straightforward cases seem applicable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll integer solutions have been identified.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Conclusion</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>\nThere are **four** integer solutions:\n- \\(x = -5\\)\n- \\(x = 1\\)\n- \\(x = 3\\)\n- \\(x = 5\\)\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies\u2014setting the exponent to zero, the base to one, and the base to negative one with an even exponent\u2014I was able to identify all integer solutions to the equation. Regular checks ensured that each solution was valid, and reflecting after each step confirmed that no solutions were missed.\n\n---\n\nI hope this approach provides a clear and thorough solution, maintaining the integrity of the original thought process while enhancing readability.",
  "ground_truth": "We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \\pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\\boxed{4}$ integer solutions."
