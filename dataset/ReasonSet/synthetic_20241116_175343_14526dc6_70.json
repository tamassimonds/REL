    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure to check my work along the way. The goal is to find \\( a + b + c \\) for the expression \\( \\sqrt{53 + 20\\sqrt{7}} \\), where the square root can be expressed in the form \\( a + b\\sqrt{c} \\).\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, the expression under the square root, \\( 53 + 20\\sqrt{7} \\), looks familiar. It reminds me of expressions that can be simplified using the technique of completing the square or expressing them as a sum of squares. \n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Express as a Sum of Squares:** Try to write \\( 53 + 20\\sqrt{7} \\) as \\( (a + b\\sqrt{c})^2 \\).\n  2. **Linear Combination of Square Roots:** Consider that \\( (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\) and see if matching coefficients helps.\n  3. **Numerical Approximation:** Estimate the value to get a rough idea if the integer solution makes sense, but this might not be very exact.\n\nHonestly, the first strategy seems the most straightforward\u2014trying to express it as a square. But I\u2019ll keep the other strategies in mind if this doesn\u2019t work out.\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Express as a Sum of Squares**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first strategy: expressing \\( 53 + 20\\sqrt{7} \\) as \\( (a + b\\sqrt{c})^2 \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- If \\( (a + b\\sqrt{c})^2 = x + y\\sqrt{z} \\), then expanding gives:\n  \\[\n  a^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{c} + b^2c = x + y\\sqrt{z}\n  \\]\n  - Matching coefficients:\n    - \\( a^2 + b^2c = x \\)\n    - \\( 2ab\\sqrt{c} = y\\sqrt{z} \\)\n  - But here, \\( \\sqrt{c} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{z} \\) must be the same for the equality to hold, implying \\( c = z \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, this requires \\( c = z \\), which might not always be the case. The given expression has \\( \\sqrt{7} \\) and needs to match that. It\u2019s limiting but let's see if it still works.\n\n**Let\u2019s try matching coefficients:**\n- Given: \\( \\sqrt{53 + 20\\sqrt{7}} \\)\n  - Let\u2019s assume \\( a + b\\sqrt{7} \\) is the form.\n  - Then, \\( (a + b\\sqrt{7})^2 = a^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{7} + 7b^2 \\).\n\n**Setting up equations:**\n- Match the rational parts:\n  \\[\n  a^2 + 7b^2 = 53\n  \\]\n  - Match the irrational parts:\n  \\[\n  2ab = 20 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad ab = 10 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = \\frac{10}{a}\n  \\]\n  \n**Substituting \\( b \\) into the equation:**\n\\[\na^2 + 7\\left(\\frac{10}{a}\\right)^2 = 53\n\\]\n\\[\na^2 + \\frac{700}{a^2} = 53\n\\]\n\\[\na^4 - 53a^2 + 700 = 0 \\quad \\text{(Multiplying both sides by } a^2\\text{)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This is a quartic equation in terms of \\( a^2 \\). Solving quartics can be messy, but maybe there's a simpler way.\n- **Alternative Thoughts:** Perhaps factoring is possible or substituting \\( a^2 = x \\) to make it a quadratic in \\( x \\).\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Quartic Equation**\n\n**Let\u2019s proceed by substituting \\( a^2 = x \\):**\n\\[\nx^2 - 53x + 700 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thinking About Factoring:**\n- I\u2019ll look for two numbers that multiply to \\( 700 \\) and add up to \\( -53 \\).\n- Possible pairs:\n  - \\( 1 \\times 700 \\)\n  - \\( 2 \\times 350 \\)\n  - \\( 4 \\times 175 \\)\n  - \\( 7 \\times 100 \\)\n  - \\( 10 \\times 70 \\)\n  - \\( 14 \\times 50 \\)\n  - \\( 28 \\times 25 \\)\n\n**Wait, none of these pairs add up to \\( -53 \\).**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider the factorization approach. Alternatively, I can use the quadratic formula:\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{53 \\pm \\sqrt{(-53)^2 - 4 \\times 700}}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{53 \\pm \\sqrt{2809 - 2800}}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{53 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{53 \\pm 3}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n**Calculating \\( x \\):**\n\\[\nx = \\frac{56}{2} = 28 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n\\]\n\n**Thinking Back:**\n- Since \\( x = a^2 \\), we have \\( a^2 = 28 \\) or \\( a^2 = 25 \\).\n- Thus, \\( a = \\sqrt{28} = 2\\sqrt{7} \\) or \\( a = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\).\n\n**Corresponding \\( b \\):**\n- Recall \\( ab = 10 \\):\n  - If \\( a = 2\\sqrt{7} \\):\n    \\[\n    2\\sqrt{7} \\times b = 10 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = \\frac{10}{2\\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{7}\n    \\]\n  - If \\( a = 5 \\):\n    \\[\n    5 \\times b = 10 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = \\frac{10}{5} = 2\n    \\]\n    \n**Possible Solutions:**\n1. \\( a = 2\\sqrt{7}, b = \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{7} \\)\n2. \\( a = 5, b = 2 \\)\n\n**Checking Both Solutions:**\n\n**For \\( a = 2\\sqrt{7}, b = \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{7} \\):**\n\\[\n(a + b\\sqrt{7})^2 = (2\\sqrt{7} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{7} \\cdot \\sqrt{7})^2 = (2\\sqrt{7} + \\frac{5 \\times 7}{7})^2 = (2\\sqrt{7} + 5)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= (2\\sqrt{7})^2 + 2 \\times 2\\sqrt{7} \\times 5 + 5^2 = 28 + 20\\sqrt{7} + 25 = 53 + 20\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n- **Reflection:** This matches the original expression. So, this solution seems valid.\n\n**For \\( a = 5, b = 2 \\):**\n\\[\n(5 + 2\\sqrt{7})^2 = 25 + 20\\sqrt{7} + 28 = 53 + 20\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n- **Reflection:** This also matches the original expression. Both solutions are correct.\n\n**But I Need \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) to be Integers and \\( c \\) to be Square-Free:**\n- In the first solution, \\( c = 7 \\), which is already square-free.\n- In the second solution, \\( c = 7 \\) as well. \n\n**Choosing the Correct Solution:**\n- Both solutions fit the criteria, but the problem asks for integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). The second solution \\( a = 5, b = 2, c = 7 \\) has all integers, while the first involves a square root in \\( a \\).\n\n**Final Decision:**\n- **Select:** \\( a = 5, b = 2, c = 7 \\)\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\( a + b + c \\)**\n\nNow, simply add them up:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = 5 + 2 + 7 = 14\n\\]\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does \\( (5 + 2\\sqrt{7})^2 \\) equal \\( 53 + 20\\sqrt{7} \\)?\n  \\[\n  (5 + 2\\sqrt{7})^2 = 25 + 20\\sqrt{7} + 28 = 53 + 20\\sqrt{7}\n  \\]\n- **Reflection:** Yes, it matches perfectly.\n\n**Does the Solution Meet All Criteria?**\n- \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are integers.\n- \\( c = 7 \\), which is square-free.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** Everything checks out.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nInitially, I thought expressing the original expression as a sum of squares would lead me directly to the solution. However, solving the resulting quartic equation required careful consideration and alternative strategies, like substituting variables. \n\n- **Reflection on Strategy:** Factoring didn't work straightforwardly, so using the quadratic formula was appropriate.\n- **Alternative Approach:** Considering numerical approximation or verification helped confirm that \\( a = 5, b = 2, c = 7 \\) was correct.\n- **Mistake and Correction:** I briefly considered both solutions but focused on integer values to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nIn the end, by systematically exploring different strategies, verifying each step, and ensuring all conditions were met, I confidently arrived at the solution. \n\n**Final Answer:** \\( \\boxed{14} \\)",

Squaring both sides, we get: \\begin{align*}\na^2+2a\\sqrt{d}+d=(a^2+d)+\\sqrt{4a^2 \\cdot d}=53+20\\sqrt{7}=53+\\sqrt{2800}\\\\\n\\end{align*}We set the terms with radicals equal to each other, and ones without radicals equal.  From this, we get that $a^2+d=53$ and $\\sqrt{4a^2 \\cdot d}=\\sqrt{2800}$, so $4a^2 \\cdot d =2800$. Solving, we get that $a=5$, and $d=28$.\n\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{53+20\\sqrt{7}}=5+\\sqrt{28}=5+2\\sqrt{7}$. $a=5$, $b=2$, and $c=7$. $a+b+c=5+2+7=\\boxed{14}$."
