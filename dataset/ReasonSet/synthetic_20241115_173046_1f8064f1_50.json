    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, writing out all my thoughts and reflecting often, just like how I'd naturally approach a tricky question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a system of equations involving absolute values. Absolute value equations often have multiple solutions because they can represent lines or distances in different quadrants. \n- **Similar Problems:** I've dealt with absolute values before, where the expressions inside can be positive or negative, leading to multiple cases.\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure how to start, but I remember that breaking it down into different cases based on the definition of absolute value might help.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Case Analysis:** Handle each possible scenario for the absolute values separately. This seems like a standard approach for absolute value equations.\n2. **Graphical Interpretation:** Plotting the equations to see where they intersect could provide visual insights.\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Try to simplify the equations step by step to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nI think starting with **Case Analysis** makes the most sense because it directly addresses the absolute values, which are the core of the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Absolute Values**\n\nBefore diving in, let's recall what absolute values mean:\n\n- **|a - b| = k** implies two scenarios: \n  - a - b = k\n  - a - b = -k\n\nSo, each absolute value equation can split into two linear equations.\n\n**Reflection:** This gives me a clue that I can set up multiple linear equations by considering both positive and negative cases for each absolute value expression.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Case Analysis**\n\nLet's apply this to the given equations:\n\n1. **|x - 3| = |y - 9|**\n   - Possible cases:\n     - Case 1.1: x - 3 = y - 9\n     - Case 1.2: x - 3 = -(y - 9)\n\n2. **|x - 9| = 2|y - 3|**\n   - Possible cases:\n     - Case 2.1: x - 9 = 2(y - 3)\n     - Case 2.2: x - 9 = -2(y - 3)\n\n**Total Possible Combinations:**\nThere are 4 combinations:\n- **(1.1 & 2.1)**\n- **(1.1 & 2.2)**\n- **(1.2 & 2.1)**\n- **(1.2 & 2.2)**\n\n**Reflection:** With four combinations, I should handle each one separately to ensure I capture all possible solutions. This seems manageable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving Each Case**\n\nLet's solve each case one by one.\n\n#### **Case 1.1: x - 3 = y - 9 and x - 9 = 2(y - 3)**\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n\n1. **From |x - 3| = |y - 9|:**\n   - x - 3 = y - 9 \u21d2 x - y = -6  (Equation A)\n   \n2. **From |x - 9| = 2|y - 3|:**\n   - x - 9 = 2(y - 3) \u21d2 x - 9 = 2y - 6 \u21d2 x - 2y = 3  (Equation B)\n\n**Solving the System:**\n\n- **Equation A:** x - y = -6\n- **Equation B:** x - 2y = 3\n\nSubtract Equation A from Equation B:\n\\[\n(x - 2y) - (x - y) = 3 - (-6) \\\\\n-x + 2y - x + y = 3 + 6 \\\\\n-y = 9 \\\\\ny = -9\n\\]\n\n**Finding x:**\nPlug y = -9 into Equation A:\n\\[\nx - (-9) = -6 \\\\\nx + 9 = -6 \\\\\nx = -15\n\\]\n\n**Solution:** (x, y) = (-15, -9)\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, y = -9 seems like a valid solution. Let me quickly check if this satisfies both original equations:\n\n- **Check |x - 3| = |y - 9|:**\n  \\[ |-15 - 3| = |-9 - 9| \\\\\n  | -18 | = | -18 | \\\\\n  18 = 18 \\text{ \u2714\ufe0f} \\]\n  \n- **Check |x - 9| = 2|y - 3|:**\n  \\[ |-15 - 9| = 2|-9 - 3| \\\\\n  | -24 | = 2| -12 | \\\\\n  24 = 24 \\text{ \u2714\ufe0f} \\]\n\nBoth checks are correct. So, (x, y) = (-15, -9) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 1.2: x - 3 = -(y - 9) and x - 9 = 2(y - 3)**\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n\n1. **From |x - 3| = |y - 9|:**\n   - x - 3 = -(y - 9) \u21d2 x - 3 = -y + 9 \u21d2 x + y = 12  (Equation C)\n\n2. **From |x - 9| = 2|y - 3|:**\n   - x - 9 = 2(y - 3) \u21d2 x - 9 = 2y - 6 \u21d2 x - 2y = 3  (Equation B, same as before)\n\n**Solving the System:**\n\n- **Equation C:** x + y = 12\n- **Equation B:** x - 2y = 3\n\nSubtract Equation B from Equation C:\n\\[\n(x + y) - (x - 2y) = 12 - 3 \\\\\nx + y - x + 2y = 9 \\\\\n3y = 9 \\\\\ny = 3\n\\]\n\n**Finding x:**\nPlug y = 3 into Equation C:\n\\[\nx + 3 = 12 \\\\\nx = 9\n\\]\n\n**Solution:** (x, y) = (9, 3)\n\n**Reflection:** Let me quickly verify this solution against both original equations:\n\n- **Check |x - 3| = |y - 9|:**\n  \\[ |9 - 3| = |3 - 9| \\\\\n  6 = 6 \\text{ \u2714\ufe0f} \\]\n  \n- **Check |x - 9| = 2|y - 3|:**\n  \\[ |9 - 9| = 2|3 - 3| \\\\\n  0 = 0 \\text{ \u2714\ufe0f} \\]\n\nBoth checks are satisfied. So, (x, y) = (9, 3) is a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 1.3: x - 3 = y - 9 and x - 9 = -2(y - 3)**\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n\n1. **From |x - 3| = |y - 9|:**\n   - x - 3 = y - 9 \u21d2 x - y = -6  (Equation A)\n\n2. **From |x - 9| = -2|y - 3|:**\n   - x - 9 = -2(y - 3) \u21d2 x - 9 = -2y + 6 \u21d2 x + 2y = 15  (Equation D)\n\n**Solving the System:**\n\n- **Equation A:** x - y = -6\n- **Equation D:** x + 2y = 15\n\nSubtract Equation A from Equation D:\n\\[\n(x + 2y) - (x - y) = 15 - (-6) \\\\\nx + 2y - x + y = 21 \\\\\n3y = 21 \\\\\ny = 7\n\\]\n\n**Finding x:**\nPlug y = 7 into Equation A:\n\\[\nx - 7 = -6 \\\\\nx = 1\n\\]\n\n**Solution:** (x, y) = (1, 7)\n\n**Reflection:** Let's check if this solution satisfies both original equations:\n\n- **Check |x - 3| = |y - 9|:**\n  \\[ |1 - 3| = |7 - 9| \\\\\n  2 = 2 \\text{ \u2714\ufe0f} \\]\n  \n- **Check |x - 9| = 2|y - 3|:**\n  \\[ |1 - 9| = 2|7 - 3| \\\\\n  8 = 8 \\text{ \u2714\ufe0f} \\]\n\nBoth checks are correct, so (1, 7) is a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 1.4: x - 3 = -(y - 9) and x - 9 = -2(y - 3)**\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n\n1. **From |x - 3| = |y - 9|:**\n   - x - 3 = -(y - 9) \u21d2 x - 3 = -y + 9 \u21d2 x + y = 12  (Equation C)\n\n2. **From |x - 9| = -2|y - 3|:**\n   - x - 9 = -2(y - 3) \u21d2 x - 9 = -2y + 6 \u21d2 x + 2y = 15  (Equation D, same as before)\n\n**Solving the System:**\n\n- **Equation C:** x + y = 12\n- **Equation D:** x + 2y = 15\n\nSubtract Equation C from Equation D:\n\\[\n(x + 2y) - (x + y) = 15 - 12 \\\\\nx + 2y - x - y = 3 \\\\\ny = 3\n\\]\n\n**Finding x:**\nPlug y = 3 into Equation C:\n\\[\nx + 3 = 12 \\\\\nx = 9\n\\]\n\n**Solution:** (x, y) = (9, 3)\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a second, I've already encountered this solution in **Case 1.2**. This means that this case doesn't provide a new solution but instead matches an already found solution.\n\n**Realization:** Not all cases yield unique solutions. Some might repeat solutions already discovered in other cases. This is important to note to avoid counting solutions multiple times.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Solutions Found**\n\nFrom the four cases, we have three distinct solutions:\n\n1. **Case 1.1:** (x, y) = (-15, -9)\n2. **Case 1.2:** (x, y) = (9, 3)\n3. **Case 1.3:** (x, y) = (1, 7)\n\n**Reflection:** Initially, I thought each case would yield unique solutions, but I ended up with three distinct solutions. This is a common occurrence in absolute value problems where multiple cases overlap.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solutions**\n\nBefore proceeding, let's verify that all three solutions satisfy both original equations.\n\n1. **(x, y) = (-15, -9):**\n   - |x - 3| = |-15 - 3| = 18\n   - |y - 9| = |-9 - 9| = 18\n   - \u2713 18 = 18\n   \n   - |x - 9| = |-15 - 9| = 24\n   - 2|y - 3| = 2|-9 - 3| = 24\n   - \u2713 24 = 24\n\n2. **(x, y) = (9, 3):**\n   - |x - 3| = |9 - 3| = 6\n   - |y - 9| = |3 - 9| = 6\n   - \u2713 6 = 6\n   \n   - |x - 9| = |9 - 9| = 0\n   - 2|y - 3| = 2|3 - 3| = 0\n   - \u2713 0 = 0\n\n3. **(x, y) = (1, 7):**\n   - |x - 3| = |1 - 3| = 2\n   - |y - 9| = |7 - 9| = 2\n   - \u2713 2 = 2\n   \n   - |x - 9| = |1 - 9| = 8\n   - 2|y - 3| = 2|7 - 3| = 8\n   - \u2713 8 = 8\n\n**Reflection:** All three solutions satisfy both original equations, confirming their validity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Sum of All Solutions**\n\nNow, let's find \\( S = x_1 + y_1 + x_2 + y_2 + \\dots + x_n + y_n \\). From our solutions:\n\n1. **(x\u2081, y\u2081) = (-15, -9)**\n2. **(x\u2082, y\u2082) = (9, 3)**\n3. **(x\u2083, y\u2083) = (1, 7)**\n\nAdding them together:\n\\[\nS = (-15) + (-9) + 9 + 3 + 1 + 7\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nS = (-15) + (-9) + 9 + 3 + 1 + 7 \\\\\n= -24 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 7 \\\\\n= -15 + 3 + 1 + 7 \\\\\n= -12 + 1 + 7 \\\\\n= -11 + 7 \\\\\n= -4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Let me quickly recheck the addition to ensure there's no mistake:\n\n- **Step 1:** (-15) + (-9) = -24\n- **Step 2:** -24 + 9 = -15\n- **Step 3:** -15 + 3 = -12\n- **Step 4:** -12 + 1 = -11\n- **Step 5:** -11 + 7 = -4\n\nThe sum checks out. So, \\( S = -4 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Approach Validation:** Starting with **Case Analysis** was effective in this problem. It allowed me to systematically explore all possible scenarios involving absolute values.\n- **Dealing with Repeated Solutions:** Realizing that some cases yielded duplicate solutions helped avoid overcounting.\n- **Verification is Key:** Checking each solution against the original equations ensured correctness.\n- **Reflection Throughout:** Constantly reflecting and verifying steps prevented mistakes and guided the solution process.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-4}\n\\]\n\nThis detailed, step-by-step approach ensured that all possible solutions were considered, verified, and correctly summed to arrive at the final answer.",
