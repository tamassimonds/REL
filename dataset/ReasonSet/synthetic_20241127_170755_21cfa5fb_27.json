  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how you'd think through it naturally. I'll walk you through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness, and making adjustments as needed. Here\u2019s how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**What\u2019s Given:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n(\\log_{10} x)^2 - \\log_{10}(x^2) = 48\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\n\nwith \\( x < 1 \\).\n\n**What We Need to Compute:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n(\\log_{10} x)^3 - \\log_{10}(x^3)\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Logs Involved:** The presence of logarithms suggests that properties of logarithms might be helpful.\n- **Exponents and Logs:** I recall that \\(\\log(x^n) = n \\cdot \\log(x)\\). Maybe I can apply this property.\n- **Solving for \\(\\log_{10} x\\):** If I can find the value of \\(\\log_{10} x\\), it would simplify the second expression.\n\n**First Impression:** This looks like a problem where manipulating logarithmic expressions will lead to solving for the unknown.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Applying Logarithmic Identities**\n\n- **Thought Process:** I can use the property \\(\\log(x^n) = n \\cdot \\log(x)\\) to simplify \\(\\log_{10}(x^2)\\). Let\u2019s see if that helps.\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(x^2) = 2 \\cdot \\log_{10} x\n\\]\n\n- **Substituting Back:** Let's substitute this into the original equation.\n\n\\[\n(\\log_{10} x)^2 - 2 \\cdot \\log_{10} x = 48\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This simplifies the equation to a quadratic in terms of \\(\\log_{10} x\\). Quadratics are straightforward to solve, so this seems like a good path.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 1: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Step 1: Let\u2019s Set \\( y = \\log_{10} x \\)**\n\n- **Why?** To make the equation cleaner and easier to handle.\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 2y = 48\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 2y - 48 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This is a standard quadratic equation. I can solve it using the quadratic formula or factoring if possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:** Let's see if the quadratic can be factored easily. If not, I'll use the quadratic formula.\n\n**Attempting to Factor:**\n\n- **Looking for Factors of -48:** I need two numbers that multiply to -48 and add up to -2.\n\n\\[\n(y - 8)(y + 6) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \n\n\\[\n-8 + 6 = -2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -8 \\times 6 = -48\n\\]\n\n**Factoring Successful!**\n\n\\[\n(y - 8)(y + 6) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n\\[\ny - 8 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 8\n\\]\n\\[\ny + 6 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = -6\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:** Recall that \\( y = \\log_{10} x \\). So, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10} x = 8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\log_{10} x = -6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** The problem states \\( x < 1 \\). Since \\(\\log_{10} x = 8\\) implies \\( x = 10^8 \\), which is greater than 1, this solution doesn't satisfy the condition \\( x < 1 \\). Therefore, only \\(\\log_{10} x = -6\\) is valid.\n\n**Valid Solution:**\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10} x = -6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 10^{-6}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** \\( x = 10^{-6} \\) is indeed less than 1, so this solution fits the given constraint.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying the Solution to the Second Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:** Now that I have \\(\\log_{10} x = -6\\), I can substitute this into the expression we need to compute:\n\n\\[\n(\\log_{10} x)^3 - \\log_{10}(x^3)\n\\]\n\n**Substituting \\( y = -6 \\):**\n\n\\[\n(-6)^3 - \\log_{10}(x^3)\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\((-6)^3\\):**\n\n\\[\n(-6)^3 = -216\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:** I need to simplify \\(\\log_{10}(x^3)\\). Using the logarithmic identity again:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(x^3) = 3 \\cdot \\log_{10} x = 3 \\cdot (-6) = -18\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This substitution seems straightforward. Let's proceed and see if it makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Plugging Back into the Expression**\n\n\\[\n(-6)^3 - \\log_{10}(x^3) = -216 - (-18)\n\\]\n\\[\n= -216 + 18\n\\]\n\\[\n= -198\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** The calculations are straightforward, and the negative signs are accounted for correctly. This outcome seems logical given the values involved.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:** Before finalizing the answer, let's ensure that all steps make sense and that no errors were made in the process.\n\n- **Solving the Quadratic:** The factoring was correct, and only \\(\\log_{10} x = -6\\) satisfied \\( x < 1 \\).\n- **Substituting into the Expression:** The calculations for \\((-6)^3\\) and \\(\\log_{10}(x^3)\\) were correct.\n- **Final Computation:** The subtraction was handled correctly, leading to the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-198}\n\\]\n\n**<ANSWER> solution:** -198 **</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategies and Reflection**\n\n**Alternative Strategy 1:** Using Different Logarithmic Properties\n\n- **Thought Process:** Initially, I considered using \\(\\log(a) - \\log(b) = \\log\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)\\), but it's not directly applicable here due to the exponents and squares involved.\n\n- **Reflection:** This property doesn't simplify the original equation effectively, so it's better to stick with the initial approach of applying \\(\\log(x^n) = n \\cdot \\log(x)\\).\n\n**Alternative Strategy 2:** Numerical Verification\n\n- **Thought Process:** As a quick check, I could plug \\( x = 10^{-6} \\) back into the original equation to verify.\n\n\\[\n(\\log_{10} (10^{-6}))^2 - \\log_{10}((10^{-6})^2) = 36 - 12 = 24\n\\]\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** Hmm, that doesn't match the given equation \\( 48 \\). Let me double-check my steps.\n\n**Reflection:** This indicates a possible oversight. Let me revisit the quadratic equation and the value of \\( y \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:** Let\u2019s go back to the quadratic equation to ensure that the solutions are correct.\n\n**Given:**\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 2y - 48 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Factoring:**\n\n\\[\n(y - 8)(y + 6) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n\\[\ny = 8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = -6\n\\]\n\n**Valid Solution:** Since \\( x < 1 \\), only \\( y = -6 \\) is valid.\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10} x = -6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 10^{-6}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Plugging \\( y = -6 \\) back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n(-6)^2 - 2(-6) = 36 + 12 = 48\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Oh, wait! That actually matches the given equation \\( 48 \\). My earlier quick check was incorrect because I misinterpreted the substitution. The initial approach was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Validation**\n\n**Thought Process:** Now that the quadratic solution is confirmed correct, and the substitution into the second expression yields a consistent result, the final answer is validated.\n\n**Check:** All steps logically follow from one another, and the numerical calculations are accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The initial strategy of applying logarithmic identities and solving the resulting quadratic equation was effective. The final computation accurately reflects the given conditions, leading to the correct answer of \\(-198\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-198}\n\\]\n\n**<ANSWER> solution:** -198 **</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** By systematically applying logarithmic properties, solving the resulting quadratic equation, and carefully validating each step, we've arrived at the correct solution. Alternative strategies were considered but ultimately reinforced the effectiveness of the initial approach.",
  "ground_truth": "Using the identity $\\log_{10}(x^2) = 2 \\log_{10} x,$ the first equation simplifies to \\[(\\log_{10}x)^2 - 2\\log_{10} x = 48.\\]Subtracting $48$ from both sides gives a quadratic equation in $\\log_{10} x,$ which factors as \\[(\\log_{10} x- 8)(\\log_{10} x + 6) = 0.\\]Since $x < 1,$ we have $\\log_{10} x < 0,$ so we must choose the negative root, $\\log_{10} x = -6.$ Then using the identity $\\log_{10}(x^3) = 3 \\log_{10} x$ gives the answer: \\[\\begin{aligned} (\\log_{10}x)^3 - \\log_{10}x^3 &= (\\log_{10}x)^3 - 3\\log_{10} x \\\\ &= (-6)^3 - 3(-6) \\\\ &= -216 + 18 \\\\ &= \\boxed{-198}. \\end{aligned}\\]"
