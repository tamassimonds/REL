    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust my approach as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\]\n\nI think, \"This looks like a linear equation involving two variables, but it's not in the standard form.\" Immediately, I recall that problems involving absolute differences between variables often hint at either factoring, completing the square, or perhaps some manipulation to make it more manageable.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Rearranging the Equation:** Maybe I can group terms related to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to see if that helps.\n  \n2. **Factoring:** Look if factoring could simplify it, but the mixed terms (\\(-3a\\) and \\(4b\\)) make me hesitant.\n\n3. **Substitution or Elimination:** Usually used for systems of equations, but we only have one equation here.\n\n4. **Completing the Square:** A method I'm familiar with for dealing with quadratics, but not sure if that applies here directly.\n\n5. **Exploring Small Integer Values:** Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers, maybe plugging in some small values could give a hint.\n\n**Wait a Moment...**\n\nBut I realize: since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, perhaps there's a way to transform the equation that makes searching for integer solutions easier without guessing.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Rearranging the Equation**\n\nLet's start by trying to rearrange the equation to see if that helps:\n\n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe grouping terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) separately could reveal a pattern or a way to factor.\n\n**Attempting to Rearrange:**\n\n\\[\nab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\\\\na(b - 3) + 4b = 137\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis feels like it's getting somewhere. By factoring out \\(a\\), I can see \\(b\\) is offset by 3, which might be useful.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yeah, because now it\u2019s easier to see the relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Introducing a New Variable**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nLet\u2019s introduce a new variable to simplify the equation. Let\u2019s set:\n\n\\[\nc = b - 3 \\quad \\text{(so, \\(b = c + 3\\))}\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Back:**\n\n\\[\na(c + 3) + 4(c + 3) = 137 \\\\\nac + 3a + 4c + 12 = 137 \\\\\nac + 3a + 4c = 125 \\quad \\text{(subtract 12 from both sides)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks cleaner! Now, the equation is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(c\\), which might be easier to work with.\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, does this help with finding \\( |a - b| \\)? Recall that \\(b = c + 3\\), so:\n\n\\[\n|a - b| = |a - (c + 3)| = |(a - c) - 3|\n\\]\n\nHmm, now the problem is about minimizing \\(|(a - c) - 3|\\), which is similar to minimizing \\(|m - 3|\\) where \\(m = a - c\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Rewriting the Equation in Terms of \\(m\\)**\n\n**Goal:**\n\nExpress the equation in terms of \\(m\\) to see how it relates to minimizing \\(|m - 3|\\).\n\n**From Previous Step:**\n\n\\[\nac + 3a + 4c = 125 \\\\\na(c + 3) + 4c = 125 \\\\\na(b) + 4(c) = 125 \\quad \\text{(recalling \\(b = c + 3\\))}\n\\]\n\n**Substitute \\(b = c + 3\\):**\n\n\\[\na(c + 3) + 4c = 125 \\\\\nac + 3a + 4c = 125\n\\]\n\nDoesn\u2019t seem to lead directly to \\(m\\). I\u2019m feeling a bit stuck here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, maybe substituting back isn't helping. Perhaps a different approach is needed.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s see if considering \\( |a - b| = |a - (c + 3)| = |(a - c) - 3| \\) can lead us somewhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using the Completed Square Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince the previous step didn't lead clearly to minimizing \\(|a - b|\\), maybe completing the square could help in managing the quadratic-like form.\n\n**Original Equation:**\n\n\\[\nab - 3a + 4b = 137\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging Again:**\n\n\\[\nab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\\\\na(b - 3) + 4b = 137\n\\]\n\n**Completing the Square:**\n\nHmm, I remember completing the square is useful for quadratics. Let's see if we can complete the square for the \\(a\\) terms.\n\n\\[\na(b - 3) + 4b = 137 \\\\\na(b - 3) = 137 - 4b \\\\\na = \\frac{137 - 4b}{b - 3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis gives \\(a\\) in terms of \\(b\\), which might help if we can find integer values satisfying this.\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, the denominator \\(b - 3\\) must divide the numerator \\(137 - 4b\\) for \\(a\\) to be an integer.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nMaybe we can find values of \\(b\\) such that \\(b - 3\\) is a divisor of \\(137 - 4b\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding Divisors**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nLet\u2019s find integer values of \\(b\\) where \\(b - 3\\) divides \\(137 - 4b\\).\n\n**Setting Up the Division:**\n\n\\[\nb - 3 \\mid 137 - 4b\n\\]\n\nRearranging \\(137 - 4b\\):\n\n\\[\n137 - 4b = 137 - 4(b - 3) - 12 = 137 - 4b + 12 = 149 - 4b\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nb - 3 \\mid 149 - 4b\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis means \\(b - 3\\) must be a divisor of \\(149 - 4b\\). Let me think about this. It looks like we can find potential \\(b\\) values by considering divisors.\n\n**Wait a Moment...**\n\nBut, instead of finding all divisors, perhaps checking small integer values directly could also work since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me start checking small values of \\(b\\) and see if \\(a\\) comes out as a positive integer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Testing Small Integer Values**\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nGiven that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers, I\u2019ll test small \\(b\\) values to see if corresponding \\(a\\) values are also positive integers.\n\n**Starting with \\(b = 4\\):**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{137 - 4(4)}{4 - 3} = \\frac{137 - 16}{1} = 121\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, for \\(b = 4\\), \\(a = 121\\). This gives:\n\n\\[\n|a - b| = |121 - 4| = 117\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs \\(117\\) the minimum? Hmm, let\u2019s test a few more \\(b\\) values to see if we can get a smaller \\(|a - b|\\).\n\n**Trying \\(b = 5\\):**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{137 - 4(5)}{5 - 3} = \\frac{137 - 20}{2} = \\frac{117}{2} = 58.5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, \\(a = 58.5\\) isn\u2019t an integer. So, \\(b = 5\\) doesn\u2019t work.\n\n**Trying \\(b = 6\\):**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{137 - 4(6)}{6 - 3} = \\frac{137 - 24}{3} = \\frac{113}{3} \\approx 37.67\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAgain, \\(a\\) isn\u2019t an integer. This suggests that not all \\(b\\) values lead to integer \\(a\\), which makes sense given the condition that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers.\n\n**Continuing with \\(b = 7\\):**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{137 - 4(7)}{7 - 3} = \\frac{137 - 28}{4} = \\frac{109}{4} = 27.25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nStill not an integer. It seems I\u2019m not getting integer \\(a\\) values for \\(b > 4\\). Perhaps there\u2019s a pattern here.\n\n**Pause and Reflect:**\n\nMaybe \\(b\\) values larger than 4 don\u2019t yield integer \\(a\\) due to the division by \\(b - 3\\). Let me check a few more to be sure.\n\n**Trying \\(b = 8\\):**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{137 - 4(8)}{8 - 3} = \\frac{137 - 32}{5} = \\frac{105}{5} = 21\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFor \\(b = 8\\), \\(a = 21\\). This gives:\n\n\\[\n|a - b| = |21 - 8| = 13\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, \\(13\\) is smaller than \\(117\\) from \\(b = 4\\)! Could this be the minimal possible value? Let\u2019s test \\(b = 9\\) to see if we can get an even smaller \\(|a - b|\\).\n\n**Trying \\(b = 9\\):**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{137 - 4(9)}{9 - 3} = \\frac{137 - 36}{6} = \\frac{101}{6} \\approx 16.83\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n\\(a\\) isn\u2019t an integer here either. So, testing \\(b = 9\\) doesn\u2019t give a valid \\(a\\).\n\n**Realization:**\n\nIt seems that increasing \\(b\\) beyond 8 doesn\u2019t yield integer \\(a\\) values. Therefore, \\(b = 8\\) and \\(a = 21\\) might be the optimal solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Solution Found:**\n\nWhen \\(b = 8\\), \\(a = 21\\), so:\n\n\\[\n|a - b| = |21 - 8| = 13\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet's plug \\(a = 21\\) and \\(b = 8\\) back into the original equation to ensure it's correct:\n\n\\[\nab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\\\\n21 \\times 8 - 3 \\times 21 + 4 \\times 8 = 137 \\\\\n168 - 63 + 32 = 137 \\\\\n105 + 32 = 137 \\\\\n137 = 137\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe equation holds true, so the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nGiven the checks above, and since testing \\(b\\) values above 8 didn\u2019t yield integer \\(a\\) values, I\u2019m confident that the minimal possible value of \\(|a - b|\\) is indeed \\(13\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Started by exploring different strategies like rearranging, factoring, and testing small values.\n\n- **Rearranging the Equation:** Attempted to group terms, which led to introducing a new variable to simplify the expression.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Considered completing the square but realized that directly testing integer solutions was more straightforward.\n\n- **Testing Integer Values:** Checked small \\(b\\) values to find corresponding \\(a\\) values, identifying that \\(b = 8\\) and \\(a = 21\\) provided the minimal \\(|a - b|\\).\n\n- **Verification:** Plugged the values back into the original equation to confirm the solution was correct.\n\n- **Reflection and Check:** Regularly checked if each step made sense, ensuring that the approach was leading to a valid solution.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with continuous reflection and adjustment, led us to confidently determine the minimal possible value of \\(|a - b|\\) as \\(13\\).",

Thus, $$ab - 3a + 4b -12 = 125 \\rightarrow (a+4)(b-3) = 125$$Since $a,b$ are positive integers, then $a+4, b-3$ must be a pair of factors of $125= 5^3$, so $(a+4,b-3)$ must be among  $$(1,125), (5,25), (25,5),(125,1).$$Thus, $(a,b)$ must be among  $$(-3,128), (1,28), (21,8), (121,4).$$Ruling out the first solution on account of the negative value for $a$, we find that the minimal value of $|a-b|$ among the remaining three is $|21-8|=\\boxed{13}$."
