    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem about Misha. I'll approach it just like I would if I were working through it myself, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and checking my progress along the way. Let's begin by really understanding the question.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, a few things stand out:\n\n- **Misha is the 50th best and the 50th worst student.** This seems contradictory at first because being ranked 50th best implies there are at least 50 students better than her, and being ranked 50th worst implies there are at least 50 students worse.\n  \n- **Question is about the total number of students.** I need to find out how many students fit into these rankings.\n\nInitially, I'm thinking, \"This looks like a problem involving ranking and possibly the total number of students in a list.\" But I'm not entirely sure how to proceed.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Visualize the Rankings:**\n   - Maybe drawing a number line or list could help visualize where Misha fits in compared to other students.\n\n2. **Use Mathematical Equations:**\n   - Perhaps setting up equations based on rankings to find the total number of students.\n\n3. **Consider Overlapping Positions:**\n   - Think about how positions can overlap; for example, being 50th in both best and worst.\n\nAt this point, none of these seem immediately clear, but visualizing the rankings feels like a good starting point. Let's try that and see where it leads.\n\n### **Step 1: Visualizing the Rankings**\n\nLet me think about what it means to be both the 50th best and 50th worst:\n\n- **50th Best:** There are 49 students better than Misha.\n- **50th Worst:** There are 49 students worse than Misha.\n\nWait, this suggests that Misha is exactly in the middle of the rankings. But this doesn't seem to make sense because normally, the top 100 would be the top 100, and the bottom 100 would be the bottom 100.\n\nHmm, maybe I've misinterpreted this. Let me reconsider.\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nThinking about it again, being 50th best and 50th worst implies Misha is at a unique position where both the number of students better and worse than her is the same. This suggests that there could be an overlap in the rankings, which is only possible if the total number of students is 2 times 50 minus 1 (to account for her being in the middle).\n\n### **Step 2: Re-evaluating the Strategy**\n\nGiven this reflection, perhaps a mathematical approach would be more effective. Let's try setting up an equation based on the total number of students.\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nLet:\n- \\( N \\) = total number of students\n\nFrom the problem:\n- Misha is the 50th best, so there are 49 students better than her.\n- Misha is the 50th worst, so there are 49 students worse than her.\n\nThe key realization here is that the rankings overlap at Misha's position. So, the total number of students is:\n\n\\[\nN = \\text{Number of students better} + \\text{Number of students worse} + 1 (\\text{Misha herself})\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN = 49 + 49 + 1 = 99\n\\]\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\nLet me double-check this:\n\n- If there are 49 students better and 49 worse, including Misha, that adds up to 99.\n- This makes sense because the rankings overlap, so Misha occupies a unique position in the middle.\n\n### **Natural Check**\n\nDoes 99 students make sense? Let's see:\n\n- With 99 students, being 50th best means 49 above her.\n- Being 50th worst means 49 below her.\n- This aligns perfectly, as the total encompasses all students, including Misha.\n\n### **Step 4: Confirming the Solution**\n\nEverything checks out. The total number of students in Misha's grade is **99**.\n\n### **Alternative Approach**\n\nTo ensure the solution is robust, let's briefly consider another method.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Total Number Students Calculation**\n\n- **Total Number of Students (N):** To be both 50th best and 50th worst, the total number of students is \\( N = 50 + 49 + 1 = 100 \\). Rechecking, this seems incorrect because it doesn't account for Misha's unique position overlapping both rankings.\n\nWait, this contradicts our earlier finding. This suggests that the initial approach was more accurate.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nIt's important to verify different strategies to ensure accuracy. In this case, visualizing the rankings and setting up the equation led to the correct total number of students.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and checking the work, the total number of students in Misha's grade is **99**. This approach ensured a thorough understanding and verification, leading to a confident and correct solution.",
