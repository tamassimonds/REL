  "problem": "How many sides does a square have?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem, thinking like a human by brainstorming, reflecting, and checking our work along the way. I'll start by exploring different strategies, being open to changing directions if needed, and ensuring the solution is thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nHmm, the question asks, \"How many sides does a square have?\" At first glance, this seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything. It's been a while since I studied basic shapes, so recalling those lessons might be helpful.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Recall Basic Geometry:**  \n   Think back to primary school lessons about polygons.\n\n2. **Visualize a Square:**  \n   Try to picture a square or draw one to examine its properties.\n\n3. **Consider Definitions:**  \n   Reflect on the formal definition of a square.\n\n4. **Explore Alternative Shapes:**  \n   Compare a square to other polygons like triangles and pentagons.\n\n5. **Look at Real-World Examples:**  \n   Consider objects shaped like squares to confirm.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI think starting with recalling basic geometry and visualizing a square might be the easiest approach. If that doesn't clarify things, I'll move on to defining it formally and comparing it with other shapes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Recalling Basic Geometry**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- I remember that a square is a type of polygon.\n- Polygons are shapes with straight sides.\n- But how many sides does a square specifically have?\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI think a square has four sides, but I want to double-check to be sure. Just relying on memory might not be enough, so let's explore further.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nIf recalling isn't definitive, visualizing or drawing a square could help confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Visualizing a Square**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Let me try to picture a square in my mind.\n- Better yet, I'll grab a piece of paper and draw one to see for myself.\n\n**Action:**\n\n- Drawing a square:  \n  ![Square Drawing](Imagine a simple square here)\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- I see four straight lines connecting at right angles.\n- Each side appears equal in length.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLooking at the drawing, it definitely has four sides. This visual confirmation supports my initial recall. However, I want to ensure there's no trick in the question.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes the drawing help confirm the number of sides? Yes, it does.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nIf visualizing wasn't clear, considering the formal definition would be the next step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Definitions**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- What exactly defines a square?\n- I recall that a square is a regular quadrilateral.\n\n**Definition:**  \nA square is a polygon with four equal sides and four right angles.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThe definition clearly states that a square has four sides. This aligns with both my recall and the drawing.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything is pointing towards four sides. But let's ensure there's no ambiguity in the definition.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIs there any ambiguity in the definition? No, it's straightforward.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nTo reinforce understanding, comparing a square to other polygons could be helpful.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Alternative Shapes**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- How does a square compare to other polygons like triangles or pentagons?\n- A triangle has three sides, a pentagon has five, etc.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nBy comparing, I can see that each polygon has a specific number of sides, and a square fits in as having four.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis comparison solidifies that a square indeed has four sides. There's consistency across different shapes.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this comparison make sense? Yes, it reinforces the original idea.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nIf still uncertain, looking at real-world examples could provide additional confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Real-World Examples**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Think of objects shaped like squares\u2014chessboards, tiles, picture frames, etc.\n- How many sides do these objects have?\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nEvery square object I can think of has four sides. This real-world application supports the earlier conclusions.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nReal-world examples align with the geometric definition and the drawing. It all adds up.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIs there any real-world example that contradicts this? No, all square objects have four sides.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Check:**  \nAfter exploring multiple strategies\u2014recalling geometry, visualizing, defining, comparing shapes, and considering real-world examples\u2014everything consistently points to a square having four sides.\n\n<ANSWER>  \nA square has **four** sides.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBy approaching the problem from various angles and checking each step, I can confidently conclude that a square has four sides. This thorough exploration ensures that the answer is correct, even for a seemingly simple question.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap of the Thought Process**\n\n1. **Initial Brainstorming:**  \n   Consider different strategies like recalling, visualizing, defining, comparing, and real-world examples.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Exploration:**  \n   Start with recalling basic geometry, then visualize by drawing, confirm with definitions, compare with other polygons, and finally, look at real-world examples.\n\n3. **Frequent Reflections and Checks:**  \n   At each step, verify the correctness of the approach and ensure consistency across different methods.\n\n4. **Final Confirmation:**  \n   All strategies align, leading to a confident conclusion.\n\nBy thinking like a human\u2014exploring, reflecting, checking, and being open to changing strategies\u2014I ensured a comprehensive and accurate solution to the problem.\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:**  \nThis approach not only confirms the correctness of the answer but also demonstrates the importance of verifying and validating knowledge through multiple perspectives. It highlights the human tendency to question, reflect, and seek confirmation, ensuring that even simple questions are thoroughly understood.\n\n---",
