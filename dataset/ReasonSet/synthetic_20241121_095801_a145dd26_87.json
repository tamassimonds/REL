  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving this on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n- **Brainstorming:**  \n  Okay, we have a rectangle \\(ABCD\\) with \\(AB = 100\\). Point \\(E\\) is the midpoint of \\(\\overline{AD}\\). We're also given that lines \\(AC\\) and \\(BE\\) are perpendicular. The goal is to find the greatest integer less than \\(AD\\).\n\n- **Initial Reflection:**  \n  This reminds me of problems involving rectangles and diagonals, especially with midpoints and perpendicularity. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry or the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:**  \n  - **Coordinate Geometry:** Assign coordinates to the rectangle and compute vectors.\n  - **Pythagorean Theorem:** Use properties of right triangles since \\(AC\\) and \\(BE\\) are perpendicular.\n  - **Vector Dot Product:** Perpendicular lines have a dot product of zero.\n\n- **Unsure Where to Start:**  \n  Honestly, multiple strategies seem viable. Let's start with coordinate geometry to see if it works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Assigning Coordinates**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Assigning coordinates might simplify the problem by making calculations straightforward.\n\n- **Assign Coordinates:**  \n  Let's set up the rectangle in a coordinate plane:\n  - \\(A = (0, 0)\\)\n  - \\(B = (100, 0)\\) since \\(AB = 100\\)\n  - \\(D = (0, h)\\) where \\(h = AD\\) (the length we need to find)\n  - \\(C = (100, h)\\) to complete the rectangle\n\n- **Defining Point \\(E\\):**  \n  Since \\(E\\) is the midpoint of \\(\\overline{AD}\\), its coordinates are:\n  \\[\n  E = \\left(0, \\frac{h}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n- **Checking:**  \n  This setup seems correct. The midpoint calculation looks good.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing Lines \\(AC\\) and \\(BE\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Now, let's find the vectors for \\(AC\\) and \\(BE\\) to use the perpendicularity condition.\n\n- **Calculating Vector \\(AC\\):**  \n  \\[\n  AC = C - A = (100, h) - (0, 0) = (100, h)\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating Vector \\(BE\\):**  \n  \\[\n  BE = E - B = \\left(0, \\frac{h}{2}\\right) - (100, 0) = (-100, \\frac{h}{2})\n  \\]\n\n- **Checking:**  \n  The vectors seem correct. Moving from \\(B\\) to \\(E\\) involves negative x-direction and half of \\(h\\) in the y-direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying Perpendicularity Condition**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Two vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is zero. Let's use this condition.\n\n- **Calculating Dot Product:**  \n  \\[\n  AC \\cdot BE = (100)(-100) + (h)\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right) = -10{,}000 + \\frac{h^2}{2}\n  \\]\n  Setting the dot product to zero:\n  \\[\n  -10{,}000 + \\frac{h^2}{2} = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Solving for \\(h\\):**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{h^2}{2} = 10{,}000 \\\\\n  h^2 = 20{,}000 \\\\\n  h = \\sqrt{20{,}000} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 5{,}000} = 2\\sqrt{5{,}000}\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplifying Further:**  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{5{,}000} = \\sqrt{100 \\times 50} = 10\\sqrt{50} = 10 \\times 5\\sqrt{2} = 50\\sqrt{2}\n  \\]\n  Therefore,\n  \\[\n  h = 2 \\times 50\\sqrt{2} = 100\\sqrt{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Checking:**  \n  Wait a minute, this seems too large. Let me double-check my calculations. It doesn't seem right given the rectangle's side is 100.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Hmm, maybe I made an error in simplification. Let's go through it again carefully.\n\n- **Simplifying Correctly:**  \n  \\[\n  h = \\sqrt{20{,}000} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 5{,}000} = 2\\sqrt{5{,}000}\n  \\]\n  But,\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{5{,}000} = \\sqrt{100 \\times 50} = 10\\sqrt{50} = 10 \\times 5\\sqrt{2} = 50\\sqrt{2}\n  \\]\n  So,\n  \\[\n  h = 2 \\times 50\\sqrt{2} = 100\\sqrt{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Realization:**  \n  Actually, this simplification is correct. Let's proceed to find the greatest integer less than \\(100\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n- **Approximating \\( \\sqrt{2} \\):**  \n  \\(\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\\)\n  \\[\n  h = 100 \\times 1.414 \\approx 141.4\n  \\]\n\n- **Greatest Integer Less Than \\(h\\):**  \n  \\(\\lfloor 141.4 \\rfloor = 141\\)\n\n- **Checking:**  \n  This makes sense. Given \\(AB = 100\\), having \\(AD \\approx 141.4\\) seems reasonable for the conditions provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Validating the Solution**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Let's double-check if all conditions are satisfied with this value.\n\n- **Checking Perpendicularity:**  \n  With \\(h = 100\\sqrt{2}\\), compute the dot product again:\n  \\[\n  AC \\cdot BE = -10{,}000 + \\frac{(100\\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = -10{,}000 + \\frac{20{,}000}{2} = -10{,}000 + 10{,}000 = 0\n  \\]\n  The dot product is zero, confirming that \\(AC\\) and \\(BE\\) are perpendicular.\n\n- **Final Reflection:**  \n  Everything checks out. The approach is correct, and the calculations are consistent with the given conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>solution  \nThe greatest integer less than \\(AD\\) is \\(\\boxed{141}\\).\n</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully assigning coordinates, applying the perpendicularity condition through the dot product, and validating each step, we arrived at the correct solution. Regular checks and re-evaluations ensured that any potential errors were caught and corrected, leading us to the final answer confidently.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe greatest integer less than \\(AD\\) is \\(\\boxed{141}\\).",

As $ABCD$ is a rectangle, triangles $BCA$, and $ABE$ are also right triangles. By $AA$, $\\triangle FBA \\sim \\triangle BCA$, and $\\triangle FBA \\sim \\triangle ABE$, so $\\triangle ABE \\sim \\triangle BCA$. This gives $\\frac {AE}{AB}= \\frac {AB}{BC}$. $AE=\\frac{AD}{2}$ and $BC=AD$, so $\\frac {AD}{2AB}= \\frac {AB}{AD}$, or $(AD)^2=2(AB)^2$, so $AD=AB \\sqrt{2}$, or $100 \\sqrt{2}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{141}$."
