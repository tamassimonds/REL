I'll approach it like I would if I were working on it myself, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, and checking my work along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem states:\n\n**The equation \\( x^2 - kx - 12 = 0 \\) has only integer solutions for certain positive integers \\( k \\). What is the sum of all such values of \\( k \\)?**\n\nWhen I first read this:\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Wait, so the quadratic equation has only integer solutions for some positive \\( k \\). That reminds me of the conditions for quadratics to have integer roots\u2014maybe something about the discriminant? But let me think if there are other ways too.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:**\n  1. **Use the Discriminant:** The quadratic formula involves the discriminant; perhaps that can tell us about the nature of the roots.\n  2. **Factorization Approach:** Maybe see if the equation can be factored into integers, which would directly give integer solutions.\n  3. **Vieta\u2019s Formulas:** These relate the coefficients and roots; perhaps they can provide insights into the possible values of \\( k \\).\n\n- **Initial Feeling:** The discriminant seems like a solid starting point because it directly relates to the nature of the roots. But I'm not entirely sure\u2014maybe I'll try it and see if it leads me anywhere.\n\nAlright, let's start with the **Discriminant Approach** and see where it takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Discriminant Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Understanding the Discriminant:** For a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant \\( \\Delta \\) is given by \\( b^2 - 4ac \\). If \\( \\Delta \\) is a perfect square, the equation has integer solutions.\n\n- **Applying to Our Equation:** Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -k \\), and \\( c = -12 \\). So, the discriminant would be:\n\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = (-k)^2 - 4(1)(-12) = k^2 + 48\n  \\]\n\n- **Setting the Condition:** For the equation to have integer solutions, \\( k^2 + 48 \\) must be a perfect square. Let's set it up:\n\n  \\[\n  k^2 + 48 = m^2 \\quad \\text{for some integer } m\n  \\]\n\n- **Rearranging the Equation:**\n\n  \\[\n  m^2 - k^2 = 48\n  \\]\n\n  This looks like a difference of squares, which can be factored:\n\n  \\[\n  (m - k)(m + k) = 48\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Checking if This Makes Sense:** Okay, so we're looking for pairs of integers \\( (m - k) \\) and \\( (m + k) \\) that multiply to 48. This seems like a reasonable approach because it ties back to the properties of perfect squares.\n\n- **Potential Issue:** But wait, since \\( k \\) needs to be a positive integer, I should ensure that the solutions we find for \\( k \\) are positive.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Is 48 a manageable number for this kind of problem?  \n  Yes, 48 has multiple factor pairs, so there should be several possible solutions to explore.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding Factor Pairs of 48**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Listing Factor Pairs:** We need to find all pairs of integers \\( (m - k) \\) and \\( (m + k) \\) such that their product is 48.\n\n  \\[\n  (1, 48), (2, 24), (3, 16), (4, 12), (6, 8), (-1, -48), (-2, -24), (-3, -16), (-4, -12), (-6, -8)\n  \\]\n\n- **Ignoring Negative Solutions:** Since \\( k \\) must be positive, we can ignore the negative factor pairs.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Thinking About \\( m \\) and \\( k \\):** From each pair \\( (a, b) \\), we have:\n\n  \\[\n  m - k = a \\quad \\text{and} \\quad m + k = b\n  \\]\n\n  Adding and subtracting these equations will give us \\( m \\) and \\( k \\).\n\n- **Potential Oversight:** Do I need to worry about \\( k \\) being greater than \\( m \\)?  \n  No, because from \\( m + k = b \\) and \\( m - k = a \\), adding them gives \\( 2m = a + b \\), so \\( m = \\frac{a + b}{2} \\). As long as \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are both even or both odd, \\( m \\) will be an integer.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does each factor pair lead to integer values for \\( m \\) and \\( k \\)?  \n  Yes, as long as \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are both even or both odd.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\( k \\) for Each Factor Pair**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Solving for \\( m \\) and \\( k \\):** Let's go through each positive factor pair and calculate \\( k \\).\n\n  1. **Pair (1, 48):**\n     \\[\n     m - k = 1 \\\\\n     m + k = 48\n     \\]\n     Adding:\n     \\[\n     2m = 49 \\implies m = 24.5 \\quad \\text{(not an integer)}\n     \\]\n     **Reflection:**  \n     Wait, \\( m \\) must be an integer, but here it's 24.5. This doesn't work, so we discard this pair.\n\n  2. **Pair (2, 24):**\n     \\[\n     m - k = 2 \\\\\n     m + k = 24\n     \\]\n     Adding:\n     \\[\n     2m = 26 \\implies m = 13\n     \\]\n     Subtracting:\n     \\[\n     2k = 22 \\implies k = 11\n     \\]\n     **Check:**  \n     \\( k = 11 \\) is a positive integer. This seems valid.\n\n  3. **Pair (3, 16):**\n     \\[\n     m - k = 3 \\\\\n     m + k = 16\n     \\]\n     Adding:\n     \\[\n     2m = 19 \\implies m = 9.5 \\quad \\text{(not an integer)}\n     \\]\n     **Reflection:**  \n     Again, \\( m \\) is not an integer, so we discard this pair.\n\n  4. **Pair (4, 12):**\n     \\[\n     m - k = 4 \\\\\n     m + k = 12\n     \\]\n     Adding:\n     \\[\n     2m = 16 \\implies m = 8\n     \\]\n     Subtracting:\n     \\[\n     2k = 8 \\implies k = 4\n     \\]\n     **Check:**  \n     \\( k = 4 \\) is a positive integer. Valid.\n\n  5. **Pair (6, 8):**\n     \\[\n     m - k = 6 \\\\\n     m + k = 8\n     \\]\n     Adding:\n     \\[\n     2m = 14 \\implies m = 7\n     \\]\n     Subtracting:\n     \\[\n     2k = 2 \\implies k = 1\n     \\]\n     **Check:**  \n     \\( k = 1 \\) is a positive integer. Valid.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Summarizing Valid \\( k \\) Values:** From these pairs, we've found \\( k = 11, 4, \\) and \\( 1 \\) as valid.\n\n- **Considering Uniqueness:** Do these represent all possible positive \\( k \\) values?  \n  Yes, since we've exhausted all positive factor pairs of 48 that could lead to integer \\( k \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does each \\( k \\) lead to a perfect square discriminant?**  \n  Let's verify:\n  - For \\( k = 11 \\):  \n    \\( \\Delta = 11^2 + 48 = 121 + 48 = 169 = 13^2 \\) (perfect square)\n  - For \\( k = 4 \\):  \n    \\( \\Delta = 4^2 + 48 = 16 + 48 = 64 = 8^2 \\) (perfect square)\n  - For \\( k = 1 \\):  \n    \\( \\Delta = 1^2 + 48 = 1 + 48 = 49 = 7^2 \\) (perfect square)\n\n  **Conclusion:**  \n  All these \\( k \\) values lead to a perfect square discriminant, confirming integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Summing the Valid \\( k \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Adding the Valid \\( k \\) Values:**  \n  We've identified \\( k = 11, 4, \\) and \\( 1 \\) as valid. Let's sum them up:\n\n  \\[\n  11 + 4 + 1 = 16\n  \\]\n\n- **Double-Checking the Addition:**  \n  Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing any \\( k \\) values.  \n  We considered all positive factor pairs of 48, and each led to valid \\( k \\) values.  \n  So, the sum should be correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does the Sum Make Sense?**  \n  16 seems reasonable given the \\( k \\) values we found.\n\n- **Final Check:**  \n  Are there any other possible \\( k \\) values we haven't considered?  \n  I think we've covered all scenarios by examining each positive factor pair.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Approach Validity:**  \n  Using the discriminant was a effective starting point. It led us to factor \\( k^2 + 48 \\) into a difference of squares, which allowed us to find integer solutions systematically.\n\n- **Considering Alternative Strategies:**  \n  Initially, I thought about factorization directly or using Vieta\u2019s formulas, but the discriminant method provided a clear path.  \n  Alternative methods could involve checking each \\( k \\) individually, but that would be less efficient.\n\n- **Reflecting on the Process:**  \n  Throughout, I checked each step to ensure \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) were integers and that \\( k \\) was positive.  \n  Discarding pairs where \\( m \\) wasn't an integer was crucial to narrowing down the valid \\( k \\) values.\n\n- **Final Answer:**  \n  The sum of all such \\( k \\) values is **16**.\n\nI hope this breakdown shows a human-like thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflections, potential missteps, and checks along the way!",
