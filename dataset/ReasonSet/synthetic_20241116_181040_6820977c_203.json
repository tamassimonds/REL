    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work, and adjust my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's start by fully understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The problem states that the difference between two perfect squares is 133.\n- I need to find the smallest possible sum of these two perfect squares.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Perfect squares are numbers like \\(0, 1, 4, 9, 16, \\ldots\\) (i.e., \\(n^2\\) where \\(n\\) is an integer).\n- The difference between two perfect squares can be expressed as \\(a^2 - b^2 = 133\\) (assuming \\(a > b\\)).\n- I recall that the difference of squares factors into \\((a - b)(a + b) = 133\\).\n- This factoring idea feels familiar, but I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s the only way to approach it.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Does factoring provide a direct path to the solution?\n- Are there other methods I should consider, like looking for patterns with actual perfect squares?\n- I think starting with factoring might be a good initial approach since it directly relates to the properties of perfect squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the Factoring Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Given \\(a^2 - b^2 = 133\\), I can factor this as \\((a - b)(a + b) = 133\\).\n- This means \\(a - b\\) and \\(a + b\\) are two factors of 133.\n- I need to find pairs of integers that multiply to 133 and correspond to \\(a - b\\) and \\(a + b\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let's list the factors of 133: \\(1 \\times 133\\) and \\(7 \\times 19\\).\n- So, the possible pairs \\((a - b, a + b)\\) are:\n  1. \\((1, 133)\\)\n  2. \\((7, 19)\\)\n\n**Checking the First Pair (1, 133):**\n- \\(a - b = 1\\)\n- \\(a + b = 133\\)\n\n**Solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):**\n- Adding the two equations:  \n  \\[\n  (a - b) + (a + b) = 1 + 133 \\implies 2a = 134 \\implies a = 67\n  \\]\n- Subtracting the two equations:  \n  \\[\n  (a + b) - (a - b) = 133 - 1 \\implies 2b = 132 \\implies b = 66\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, \\(b = 66\\) is not a perfect square because \\(66\\) is not a perfect square number.\n- But the problem asks for the sum of two perfect squares, so \\(b\\) must be a perfect square.\n- This pair gives \\(b = 66\\), which means our choice of factors might be incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- It seems the first pair does not lead to both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) being perfect squares.\n- I need to reconsider which pairs to try or perhaps look for another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Revisiting the Factoring Approach with the Second Pair**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's try the second pair: \\((7, 19)\\).\n- Maybe this pair will lead to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) being perfect squares.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Assigning:  \n  \\[\n  a - b = 7\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a + b = 19\n  \\]\n\n**Solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):**\n- Adding the two equations:  \n  \\[\n  (a - b) + (a + b) = 7 + 19 \\implies 2a = 26 \\implies a = 13\n  \\]\n- Subtracting the two equations:  \n  \\[\n  (a + b) - (a - b) = 19 - 7 \\implies 2b = 12 \\implies b = 6\n  \\]\n\n**Checking Perfect Squares:**\n- \\(a = 13\\) and \\(b = 6\\).\n- \\(13\\) is \\(3^2 + 4^2\\); however, the problem only allows \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to be perfect squares themselves, not sums of squares.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, \\(a = 13\\) and \\(b = 6\\) don't both need to be perfect squares; rather, their squares need to differ by 133.\n- But \\(6\\) is not a perfect square.\n- It seems that \\(b = 6\\) also doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- This approach also leads to \\(b = 6\\), which is not a perfect square.\n- It seems that neither pair directly provides both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as perfect squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Another Approach \u2013 Listing Perfect Squares**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since the factoring method didn't yield perfect squares, maybe I should list perfect squares and check their differences to see if any pair gives a difference of 133.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let's list some perfect squares:\n  - \\(0^2 = 0\\)\n  - \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n  - \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n  - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n  - \\(4^2 = 16\\)\n  - \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n  - \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n  - \\(7^2 = 49\\)\n  - \\(8^2 = 64\\)\n  - \\(9^2 = 81\\)\n  - \\(10^2 = 100\\)\n  - \\(11^2 = 121\\)\n  - \\(12^2 = 144\\)\n  - \\(13^2 = 169\\)\n\n- Now, let's look for pairs where the difference is 133:\n  - \\(13^2 - 12^2 = 169 - 144 = 25\\)\n  - \\(12^2 - 11^2 = 144 - 121 = 23\\)\n  - \\(11^2 - 10^2 = 121 - 100 = 21\\)\n  - \\(10^2 - 9^2 = 100 - 81 = 19\\)\n  - \\(9^2 - 8^2 = 81 - 64 = 17\\)\n  - \\(8^2 - 7^2 = 64 - 49 = 15\\)\n  - \\(7^2 - 6^2 = 49 - 36 = 13\\)\n  - \\(6^2 - 5^2 = 36 - 25 = 11\\)\n  - \\(5^2 - 4^2 = 25 - 16 = 9\\)\n  - \\(4^2 - 3^2 = 16 - 9 = 7\\)\n  - \\(3^2 - 2^2 = 9 - 4 = 5\\)\n  - \\(2^2 - 1^2 = 4 - 1 = 3\\)\n\n**Observation:**\n- None of the consecutive perfect squares have a difference of 133.\n- This suggests that the difference of 133 might only occur between perfect squares that are not consecutive.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Maybe I need to consider perfect squares further apart, or perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Listing perfect squares didn't help directly, but it confirms that simple consecutive squares don't yield a difference of 133.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Re-evaluating the Factoring Approach with Negative Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Perhaps I overlooked the negative factors when assigning \\(a - b\\) and \\(a + b\\).\n- Let's consider negative factors of 133: \\((-1, -133)\\) and \\((-7, -19)\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let's attempt the negative factors:\n  - Assigning:  \n    \\[\n    a - b = -1\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    a + b = -133\n    \\]\n\n**Solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):**\n- Adding the two equations:  \n  \\[\n  (-1) + (-133) = -134 \\implies 2a = -134 \\implies a = -67\n  \\]\n- Subtracting the two equations:  \n  \\[\n  (-133) - (-1) = -132 \\implies 2b = -132 \\implies b = -66\n  \\]\n\n**Checking Perfect Squares:**\n- \\(a = -67\\) and \\(b = -66\\).\n- However, negative perfect squares are not typically considered in this context because perfect squares are non-negative integers.\n- This doesn't seem to align with the problem's requirements.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, allowing negative perfect squares doesn't make sense within the context of the problem.\n- Perfect squares in this context should be non-negative integers.\n- Therefore, negative factors aren't applicable here.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Considering negative factors isn't relevant because perfect squares are non-negative.\n- This approach doesn't lead to a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Looking for a Pattern or Alternative Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since the factoring approach didn't directly work, perhaps I need to think differently.\n- Maybe looking for a relationship or pattern between the perfect squares could help.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Algebraic Manipulation:**\n   - Use the difference of squares formula more creatively.\n   \n2. **Trial and Error:**\n   - Test different perfect squares manually to see if their difference is 133.\n   \n3. **System of Equations:**\n   - Set up equations based on the properties of perfect squares and solve.\n\n4. **Quadratic Equations:**\n   - Use quadratic equations to find possible values.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Out of these, **Trial and Error** seems straightforward and would confirm the existence of such squares.\n- **System of Equations** could work as well, but it might get complicated.\n- Considering both, I think starting with **Trial and Error** might be the most intuitive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Let's try testing different perfect squares to see if any fit the criteria.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Implementing the Trial and Error Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I'll start with small perfect squares and gradually increase to see which pairs have a difference of 133.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let's list some perfect squares again for reference:\n  - \\(0^2 = 0\\)\n  - \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n  - \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n  - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n  - \\(4^2 = 16\\)\n  - \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n  - \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n  - \\(7^2 = 49\\)\n  - \\(8^2 = 64\\)\n  - \\(9^2 = 81\\)\n  - \\(10^2 = 100\\)\n  - \\(11^2 = 121\\)\n  - \\(12^2 = 144\\)\n  - \\(13^2 = 169\\)\n  - \\(14^2 = 196\\)\n  - \\(15^2 = 225\\)\n\n- Now, let's compute the differences:\n  - \\(1^2 - 0^2 = 1 - 0 = 1\\)\n  - \\(2^2 - 0^2 = 4 - 0 = 4\\)\n  - \\(3^2 - 0^2 = 9 - 0 = 9\\)\n  - \\(4^2 - 0^2 = 16 - 0 = 16\\)\n  - \\(5^2 - 0^2 = 25 - 0 = 25\\)\n  - \\(6^2 - 0^2 = 36 - 0 = 36\\)\n  - \\(7^2 - 0^2 = 49 - 0 = 49\\)\n  - \\(8^2 - 0^2 = 64 - 0 = 64\\)\n  - \\(9^2 - 0^2 = 81 - 0 = 81\\)\n  - \\(10^2 - 0^2 = 100 - 0 = 100\\)\n  - \\(11^2 - 0^2 = 121 - 0 = 121\\)\n  - \\(12^2 - 0^2 = 144 - 0 = 144\\)\n  - \\(13^2 - 0^2 = 169 - 0 = 169\\)\n  - \\(14^2 - 0^2 = 196 - 0 = 196\\)\n  - \\(15^2 - 0^2 = 225 - 0 = 225\\)\n\n**Observation:**\n- None of these differences are 133.\n- However, all these differences are either small or increase slowly, which makes me wonder if higher perfect squares need to be considered.\n\n**Adjustment:**\n- Perhaps starting with higher perfect squares is necessary to find a difference of 133.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Let's continue testing larger perfect squares to see if the pattern holds.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Continuing with Higher Perfect Squares**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I'll keep testing pairs of perfect squares to see if any have a difference of 133.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let's extend our list:\n  - \\(13^2 - 12^2 = 169 - 144 = 25\\)\n  - \\(14^2 - 13^2 = 196 - 169 = 27\\)\n  - \\(15^2 - 14^2 = 225 - 196 = 29\\)\n  - \\(16^2 - 15^2 = 256 - 225 = 31\\)\n  - \\(17^2 - 16^2 = 289 - 256 = 33\\)\n  - \\(18^2 - 17^2 = 324 - 289 = 35\\)\n  - \\(19^2 - 18^2 = 361 - 324 = 37\\)\n  - \\(20^2 - 19^2 = 400 - 361 = 39\\)\n  - \\(21^2 - 20^2 = 441 - 400 = 41\\)\n\n**Observation:**\n- Still, none of these differences are 133.\n- It seems that even with larger perfect squares, a difference of 133 isn't easily found.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Maybe instead of testing all perfect squares sequentially, I should look for a mathematical relationship or pattern that can help identify the correct pair more efficiently.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given that testing individual perfect squares is becoming time-consuming and isn't yielding results, perhaps there's a better way to approach the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Revisiting the Factoring Approach with Insight**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Remembering from the beginning that \\(a^2 - b^2 = 133\\) factors into \\((a - b)(a + b) = 133\\).\n- Perhaps I can find integer values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that satisfy both being perfect squares and the equation.\n\n**Strategic Insight:**\n- Given that \\(a - b\\) and \\(a + b\\) are factors of 133, and considering that 133 is an odd number, both factors must be odd.\n- Therefore, \\(a - b\\) and \\(a + b\\) must both be odd integers.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- The odd factors of 133 are: \\(1\\), \\(7\\), \\(19\\), \\(133\\).\n- But since \\(a - b\\) must be less than \\(a + b\\), the pairs are:\n  - \\((1, 133)\\)\n  - \\((7, 19)\\)\n\n**Re-examining the First Pair (1, 133):**\n- \\(a - b = 1\\)\n- \\(a + b = 133\\)\n\n**Solving Again:**\n- Adding:  \n  \\[\n  2a = 134 \\implies a = 67\n  \\]\n- Subtracting:  \n  \\[\n  2b = 132 \\implies b = 66\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- As mentioned earlier, \\(b = 66\\) is not a perfect square, which conflicts with the requirement that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) need to be perfect squares.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Despite this re-examination, the first pair still doesn't yield both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as perfect squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Reflecting and Seeking an Alternative Approach**\n\n**Realization:**\n- The factoring approach, while logical, isn't providing the correct solution because it's yielding \\(b = 66\\), which isn't a perfect square.\n\n**Possible Alternative:**\n- Maybe there's a mistake in how I'm applying the factoring method or perhaps an assumption that's led me astray.\n\n**Re-thinking the Problem:**\n- The original equation is \\(a^2 - b^2 = 133\\).\n- This factors into \\((a - b)(a + b) = 133\\).\n- Therefore, \\(a - b\\) and \\(a + b\\) must be integers that multiply to 133.\n\n**Alternative Insight:**\n- Perhaps considering higher perfect squares and their differences without strictly adhering to consecutive squares could help.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given that previous attempts haven't worked, I need to think outside the box or maybe even accept that the solution isn't straightforward with basic factoring and perfect square knowledge.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Exploring the Quadratic Equation Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's consider setting up a quadratic equation based on the difference of squares to find \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Strategic Steps:**\n1. Start with the original equation:  \n   \\[\n   a^2 - b^2 = 133\n   \\]\n2. Factor it:  \n   \\[\n   (a - b)(a + b) = 133\n   \\]\n3. Let \\(x = a - b\\) and \\(y = a + b\\), so:  \n   \\[\n   xy = 133\n   \\]\n4. Also, \\(a = \\frac{x + y}{2}\\) and \\(b = \\frac{y - x}{2}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Given the odd factors of 133 are \\(1, 7, 19, 133\\), but since \\(a > b\\), we take:\n  - \\(x = 1\\), \\(y = 133\\) \u21d2 \\(a = 67\\), \\(b = 66\\)\n  - \\(x = 7\\), \\(y = 19\\) \u21d2 \\(a = 13\\), \\(b = 6\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- As previously noted, neither pair yields both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as perfect squares.\n- This suggests that perhaps the initial factoring approach isn't sufficient.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The quadratic equation approach reaffirms that \\(b\\) isn't a perfect square, which is a hint that maybe there's a deeper mathematical insight needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 12: Considering the Pythagorean Triple Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Maybe looking at the problem from the perspective of Pythagorean triples could help.\n- Pythagorean triples are sets of three positive integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) such that \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\).\n- However, our problem involves the difference of squares, so this might not directly apply.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, Pythagorean triples deal with the sum of squares, not their difference, so this approach likely won't be helpful.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Exploring Pythagorean triples doesn't seem relevant to our problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 13: Final Reflection and Realization**\n\n**Realization:**\n- Despite multiple attempts with different strategies, the factoring approach keeps leading to \\(b\\) being non-perfect squares.\n- This indicates that perhaps the problem is structured in a way that isn't immediately apparent through straightforward factoring.\n\n**Possible Insight:**\n- Maybe the problem requires recognizing that not all perfect squares need to be consecutive or that solutions might involve larger perfect squares which weren't initially considered.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given that previous strategies haven't yielded a correct solution, perhaps the problem is designed to challenge the solver to think beyond basic methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 14: Revisiting the Initial Idea with New Insight**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's go back to the original factoring idea but consider that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) might not be small perfect squares.\n  \n**Strategic Steps:**\n1. Recall that \\(a^2 - b^2 = 133\\) factors into \\((a - b)(a + b) = 133\\).\n2. The odd factors of 133 are \\(1, 7, 19, 133\\).\n3. Since \\(a > b\\), the relevant pairs are:\n   - \\(a - b = 1\\), \\(a + b = 133\\)\n   - \\(a - b = 7\\), \\(a + b = 19\\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let's solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) using both pairs:\n\n**First Pair:**\n- \\(a - b = 1\\)\n- \\(a + b = 133\\)\n\n**Solving:**\n- Adding:  \n  \\[\n  2a = 134 \\implies a = 67\n  \\]\n- Subtracting:  \n  \\[\n  2b = 132 \\implies b = 66\n  \\]\n  \n**Checking:**\n- \\(67\\) and \\(66\\) are not both perfect squares.\n\n**Second Pair:**\n- \\(a - b = 7\\)\n- \\(a + b = 19\\)\n\n**Solving:**\n- Adding:  \n  \\[\n  2a = 26 \\implies a = 13\n  \\]\n- Subtracting:  \n  \\[\n  2b = 12 \\implies b = 6\n  \\]\n  \n**Checking:**\n- \\(13\\) and \\(6\\) are not both perfect squares.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both pairs lead to \\(b\\) not being a perfect square, which suggests a flaw in the initial approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The original factoring method, while logical, doesn't align with the requirement that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be perfect squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 15: Considering a Different Approach \u2013 Setting Up a System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's try setting up equations based on the properties of perfect squares to see if we can find valid \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Strategic Steps:**\n1. Start from the fact that \\(a^2 - b^2 = 133\\).\n2. Also, consider that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are perfect squares, so \\(a = m^2\\) and \\(b = n^2\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers.\n3. The equation becomes \\(m^2 - n^2 = 133\\), which factors into \\((m - n)(m + n) = 133\\).\n4. Thus, \\(m - n\\) and \\(m + n\\) are factors of 133.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let's list the factors of 133 again: \\(1, 7, 19, 133\\).\n- Since \\(m > n\\), the possible pairs are:\n  - \\(m - n = 1\\), \\(m + n = 133\\)\n  - \\(m - n = 7\\), \\(m + n = 19\\)\n\n**Solving for \\(m\\) and \\(n\\):**\n\n**First Pair:**\n- \\(m - n = 1\\)\n- \\(m + n = 133\\)\n\n**Solving:**\n- Adding:  \n  \\[\n  2m = 134 \\implies m = 67\n  \\]\n- Subtracting:  \n  \\[\n  2n = 132 \\implies n = 66\n  \\]\n  \n**Checking:**\n- \\(67\\) and \\(66\\) are not perfect squares, which contradicts the requirement.\n\n**Second Pair:**\n- \\(m - n = 7\\)\n- \\(m + n = 19\\)\n\n**Solving:**\n- Adding:  \n  \\[\n  2m = 26 \\implies m = 13\n  \\]\n- Subtracting:  \n  \\[\n  2n = 12 \\implies n = 6\n  \\]\n  \n**Checking:**\n- \\(13\\) and \\(6\\) are not perfect squares, which again contradicts the requirement.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This approach also fails to provide a solution where both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are perfect squares.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Setting up a system of equations based on perfect squares doesn't yield a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 16: Considering Higher Perfect Squares**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Maybe the perfect squares involved are larger than those initially considered.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let's consider \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) to be higher perfect squares:\n  \n- Suppose:\n  \\[\n  m^2 - n^2 = 133\n  \\]\n  \n- Rearranging:\n  \\[\n  m^2 = n^2 + 133\n  \\]\n  \n- This suggests that \\(m^2\\) is 133 more than \\(n^2\\). Maybe finding perfect squares that differ by 133 could help.\n\n**Example:**\n- Let's pick \\(n^2 = 36\\) (which is \\(6^2\\)):\n  \\[\n  m^2 = 36 + 133 = 169 \\implies m = 13\n  \\]\n  \n- So, \\(m = 13\\), \\(n = 6\\).\n  \n**Checking:**\n- \\(m = 13\\) and \\(n = 6\\) are both integers, and their squares differ by 133:\n  \\[\n  13^2 - 6^2 = 169 - 36 = 133\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, but \\(m = 13\\) and \\(n = 6\\) don't both need to be perfect squares themselves; rather, their squares differ by 133.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- This suggests that the perfect squares can be higher than initially considered. Therefore, the perfect squares involved are \\(169\\) and \\(36\\), which sum to:\n  \\[\n  169 + 36 = 205\n  \\]\n  \n- **Final Answer:**\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{205}\n  \\]\n  \n---\n\n### **Step 17: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing the answer, let's double-check the calculations to ensure everything is correct.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Given:\n  \\[\n  m^2 - n^2 = 133\n  \\]\n  \n- From the previous example:\n  \\[\n  m = 13, \\quad n = 6\n  \\]\n  \n- Calculating their squares:\n  \\[\n  13^2 = 169, \\quad 6^2 = 36\n  \\]\n  \n- Difference:\n  \\[\n  169 - 36 = 133\n  \\]\n  \n- Sum:\n  \\[\n  169 + 36 = 205\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- The calculations align perfectly with the problem's requirements.\n- The difference between the squares is indeed 133, and the sum of the squares is correctly calculated as 205.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The solution is verified to be correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n**Realization:**\n- Initially, the factoring approach led to \\(b = 66\\) and \\(b = 6\\), which didn't satisfy the perfect square requirement.\n- However, by considering higher perfect squares and recognizing that the perfect squares involved don't need to be small, the correct pair was identified.\n\n**Insight:**\n- Sometimes, looking beyond immediate factors and considering larger perfect squares can reveal the solution.\n- It\u2019s essential to remain flexible in approach and be open to exploring different strategies when the initial one doesn't yield a valid solution.\n\n**final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{205}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- The problem required carefully linking the difference of perfect squares to their factoring properties.\n- Initially, straightforward factoring didn't work because it yielded non-perfect squares.\n- By stepping back and considering higher perfect squares, the correct solution emerged.\n- Always reflecting and checking the validity of each step is crucial in problem-solving to ensure accuracy.\n\n--- \n\n**Reiteration:**\n- Initially tempted to solve through basic factoring, the journey involved recognizing the need for broader strategies.\n- The breakthrough came by acknowledging that the perfect squares involved could be larger than expected.\n- This led to identifying \\(m = 13\\) and \\(n = 6\\), yielding the correct sum of 205.\n- Throughout, reflecting on the approach's effectiveness ensured the solution path remained correct.\n\n--- \n\n**Final Takeaway:**\n- Embrace multiple strategies and remain open to adjusting your approach.\n- Reflection and verification are key to successful problem-solving, ensuring that each step logically leads to the next.\n\n---",

  "ground_truth": "We are given that $x^2 - y^2 = 133$, which is the same as $(x+y)(x-y) = 133$. $133$ has two pairs of factors: 1 and 133, and 7 and 19. So, either $x+y = 133$ and $x-y = 1$, or $x+y = 19$ and $x-y = 7$. It is clear that $x$ and $y$ will be much larger in the first case, because they must sum to 133, so, because we are trying to minimize $x^2 + y^2$, we can simply consider the second case. Through simple algebra, we find that $x = 13$ and $y = 6$. Thus, $x^2 + y^2$ is minimized as $169 + 36 = \\boxed{205}$."
