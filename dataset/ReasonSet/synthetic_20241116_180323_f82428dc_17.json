    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a natural human thought process. I'll brainstorm various strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and adjust my approach as needed, just like I would if I were solving it myself. \n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem involves a geometric sequence with given first and second terms. We're asked to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the \\( n \\)th term is divisible by one million (\\( 10^6 \\)). \n\n**Initial brainstorming:**\n\n- **Geometric sequence:** I remember that in such sequences, each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. So, knowing the first two terms, I can find the common ratio.\n- **Divisibility by \\( 10^6 \\):** I know \\( 10^6 = 2^6 \\times 5^6 \\). This suggests that the \\( n \\)th term must have at least six factors of 2 and six factors of 5.\n- **Strategy options:**\n  - Find the common ratio and express the \\( n \\)th term in terms of it.\n  - Analyze the prime factorization requirements directly.\n  - Possibly look into logarithmic approaches to handle large exponents.\n\nWhich seems most straightforward? Let's start by finding the common ratio.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Common Ratio**\n\n**Thought process:**\n\nTo identify the common ratio (\\( r \\)), I can utilize the relationship between the first and second terms of the geometric sequence.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven:\n- First term (\\( a_1 \\)) = \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n- Second term (\\( a_2 \\)) = \\( 15 \\)\n\nIn a geometric sequence:\n\\[\na_2 = a_1 \\times r\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n15 = \\frac{3}{4} \\times r\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( r \\):**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{15}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 15 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat makes sense. The common ratio is 20. I can already see that 20 has factors of both 2 and 5, which might be useful later when checking divisibility by \\( 10^6 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Expressing the \\( n \\)th Term**\n\n**Thought process:**\n\nNow that I know the common ratio, I can write the formula for the \\( n \\)th term (\\( a_n \\)) of the geometric sequence.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe general formula for the \\( n \\)th term is:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 \\times r^{(n-1)}\n\\]\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\na_n = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 20^{(n-1)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, this formula looks good. But to determine when \\( a_n \\) is divisible by \\( 10^6 \\), I need to consider the prime factorization of both the \\( n \\)th term and \\( 10^6 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Analyzing Prime Factorization Requirements**\n\n**Thought process:**\n\nSince \\( 10^6 = 2^6 \\times 5^6 \\), the \\( n \\)th term must have at least six factors of 2 and six factors of 5.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1. **Prime factorization of the components:**\n   - \\( a_1 = \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{2^2} \\)\n     - So, \\( a_1 \\) has one factor of 3 and two factors of 2.\n   - \\( r = 20 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\)\n     - So, \\( r \\) has two factors of 2 and one factor of 5.\n\n2. **Total factors in \\( a_n \\):**\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3}{2^2} \\times (2^2 \\times 5)^{(n-1)} = \\frac{3}{2^2} \\times 2^{2(n-1)} \\times 5^{(n-1)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_n = 3 \\times 2^{2(n-1) - 2} \\times 5^{(n-1)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_n = 3 \\times 2^{2n - 4} \\times 5^{n - 1}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, now I can see the exponents of 2 and 5 in the \\( n \\)th term. To be divisible by \\( 10^6 \\), the exponents must be at least 6.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Setting Up Inequalities for Exponents**\n\n**Thought process:**\n\nI need to ensure that both exponents are greater than or equal to 6. Let's set up the inequalities.\n\n**Inequalities:**\n\n1. **For factors of 2:**\n   \\[\n   2n - 4 \\geq 6\n   \\]\n   \n2. **For factors of 5:**\n   \\[\n   n - 1 \\geq 6\n   \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Solving the inequality for \\( n \\) with factors of 2:**\n   \\[\n   2n - 4 \\geq 6 \\\\\n   2n \\geq 10 \\\\\n   n \\geq 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solving the inequality for \\( n \\) with factors of 5:**\n   \\[\n   n \\geq 7\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, interesting. The smallest \\( n \\) that satisfies both conditions is \\( n = 7 \\). But before finalizing, let's double-check if \\( n = 7 \\) actually meets the divisibility requirement.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying \\( n = 7 \\)**\n\n**Thought process:**\n\nIt's important to confirm that when \\( n = 7 \\), the \\( n \\)th term indeed has at least six factors of both 2 and 5.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nUsing the expression for \\( a_n \\):\n\\[\na_7 = 3 \\times 2^{2(7) - 4} \\times 5^{7 - 1} \\\\\na_7 = 3 \\times 2^{10} \\times 5^6\n\\]\n\n**Prime factorization:**\n\n- \\( 2^{10} \\): Has 10 factors of 2.\n- \\( 5^6 \\): Has 6 factors of 5.\n- The number 3: Does not affect the factors of 2 and 5 needed for divisibility by \\( 10^6 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nPerfect! \\( a_7 \\) has more than enough factors of both 2 and 5, so it's definitely divisible by \\( 10^6 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Confirmation**\n\n**Thought process:**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let's ensure that \\( n = 6 \\) does NOT satisfy the condition. This will confirm that \\( n = 7 \\) is indeed the smallest such \\( n \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nCheck \\( a_6 \\):\n\\[\na_6 = 3 \\times 2^{2(6) - 4} \\times 5^{6 - 1} \\\\\na_6 = 3 \\times 2^{8} \\times 5^5\n\\]\n\n**Prime factorization:**\n\n- \\( 2^8 \\): Eight factors of 2.\n- \\( 5^5 \\): Five factors of 5.\n- The number 3: Again, does not impact the required factors.\n\n**Divisibility check:**\n\n- \\( a_6 \\) has **eight** factors of 2, which is sufficient.\n- However, it only has **five** factors of 5, which is **not enough**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nExactly as expected. \\( n = 6 \\) fails to meet the requirements because it lacks the necessary factors of 5. This reinforces that \\( n = 7 \\) is indeed the smallest \\( n \\) that makes \\( a_n \\) divisible by \\( 10^6 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter thoroughly exploring different strategies, checking prime factorization, and verifying specific cases, we've determined that the smallest \\( n \\) for which the \\( n \\)th term of the sequence is divisible by one million is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]\n\nThis approach ensured that both the exponents of 2 and 5 were adequately satisfied, confirming the divisibility requirement. Each step was reflected upon and checked to ensure correctness, leading to a confident and accurate solution.",

This can only happen if $n-1$ is at least $6$, or $n \\ge 7$.\n\n\nThe $7$th term is $$\\left(20^6\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\left(4\\right)^6\\left(5\\right)^6\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = (2)^{10}(5)^6(3),$$which is divisible by $(2)^6(5)^6=10^6$, so the answer is indeed $\\boxed{7}$."
