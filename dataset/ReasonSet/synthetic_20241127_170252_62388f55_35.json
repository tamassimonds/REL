  "problem": "How many even perfect square factors does $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ have?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling it on paper\u2014complete with brainstorming, checking, and reflecting. Let's explore different strategies and adjust as needed to ensure we arrive at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see the question:\n\n**\"How many even perfect square factors does \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^9\\) have?\"**\n\na few things immediately come to mind:\n\n- **Perfect Square Factors:** I recall that perfect squares have even exponents in their prime factorization.\n- **Even Perfect Squares:** These would need to include at least the factor of 2, making them even.\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  - Listing out the factors and checking which are perfect squares.\n  - Using exponent properties to determine which combinations yield perfect squares.\n  - Focusing only on factors that include \\(2\\) to ensure they're even.\n\nAt first glance, listing all factors seems **tedious**, especially since exponents can create many combinations. I think using exponent properties might be more efficient, so I'll lean towards that.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Listing All Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nMaybe I can list all factors of \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^9\\) and then identify which ones are even perfect squares.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, that might be too time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with higher exponents. There must be a better way.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet's try a different approach. **Listing isn't practical here.**\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Using Exponent Properties**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI recall that **perfect squares have even exponents**. So, I can look at the exponents of 2 and 7 to see which combinations produce perfect squares.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems more efficient. Let's proceed with this.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementing Strategy 2: Using Exponent Properties**\n\n#### **Step 1: Prime Factorization Understanding**\n\nGiven:  \n\\[\nn = 2^4 \\cdot 7^9\n\\]  \nI need to find **even perfect square factors** of \\(n\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEven perfect square factors must have:\n- An exponent of 2 being at least **2** (to ensure evenness and a perfect square).\n- Exponents of both primes being **even** (since perfect squares require even exponents).\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Determining Possible Exponents for Perfect Squares**\n\n**For \\(2^a\\):**  \n- Possible exponents: **2 and 4** (since they need to be even and \u2264 4).\n\n**For \\(7^b\\):**  \n- Possible exponents: **0, 2, 4, 6, 8** (even and \u2264 9).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBy combining these exponents, I can form all even perfect square factors.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculating Total Perfect Square Factors**\n\n**Combining Exponents:**  \nEach factor can be represented as \\(2^a \\cdot 7^b\\) where:\n- \\(a\\) is **2 or 4** (to ensure the factor is even and a perfect square).\n- \\(b\\) is **0, 2, 4, 6, or 8** (to ensure the factor is a perfect square).\n\n**Calculating Combinations:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = \\text{Number of choices for } a \\times \\text{Number of choices for } b = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSo, there are **10 even perfect square factors**.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes this make sense? Let me double-check by listing a few to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Check: Listing Some Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s list a few to verify.\n\n1. \\(2^2 \\cdot 7^0 = 4\\)  \n2. \\(2^2 \\cdot 7^2 = 4 \\times 49 = 196\\)  \n3. \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^0 = 16\\)  \n4. \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^2 = 16 \\times 49 = 784\\)  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nThese are indeed **even perfect squares**. Listing all would take time, but the sample checks out.\n\n**Decision:**  \nI\u2019m **confident** in the calculation. The total is **10**.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Factor Counting Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nActually, there's a formulaic way to count perfect square factors by considering the exponents.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet\u2019s explore this to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Applying the Perfect Square Factor Formula**\n\n**Given:**  \n\\(n = 2^4 \\cdot 7^9\\)\n\n#### **Step 1: General Perfect Square Factors**\n\n- Perfect squares require **even exponents**.\n\n**Exponents Possibilities:**  \n- For \\(2\\): Exponents can be **0, 2, or 4** (3 options).\n- For \\(7\\): Exponents can be **0, 2, 4, 6, or 8** (5 options).\n\n**Total Perfect Square Factors:**  \n\\[\n3 \\times 5 = 15\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBut this includes factors that are **odd perfect squares** (i.e., those without the factor of 2).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI only need the **even** perfect square factors. So, I must exclude the odd ones.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Identifying Odd Perfect Square Factors**\n\n- These have \\(a = 0\\) (no factor of 2).\n\n**Combinations for Odd Perfect Squares:**  \n- \\(b\\) can be **0, 2, 4, 6, or 8** (5 options).\n\n**Total Odd Perfect Square Factors:**  \n\\[\n1 \\times 5 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSubtract these from the total perfect square factors to get the even ones.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nMakes sense to me.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculating Even Perfect Square Factors**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Even Perfect Square Factors} = 15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth strategies lead to the same answer, which increases confidence in its correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s ensure no steps are missed:\n\n- Considered all even exponents for both primes.\n- Accounted for excluding odd perfect square factors.\n- Cross-verified using two different strategies.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The approach is sound, and the answer is consistent across methods.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>Solution</ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]\n\nThere are **10 even perfect square factors** of \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^9\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Wrapping Up**\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies\u2014starting with listing, then using exponent properties, and finally applying a formula\u2014we ensured the accuracy of the solution. Along the way, quick checks and reflections helped validate each step, leading to a confident final answer.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nAlways be open to exploring different methods, especially when the initial approach seems inefficient. Reflecting and verifying along the way ensures that the solution is both accurate and elegant.",
  "ground_truth": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions."
