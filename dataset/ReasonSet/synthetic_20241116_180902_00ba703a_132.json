I'll make sure to brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work frequently\u2014just like how I would approach a problem manually. Let's begin by fully understanding what we're dealing with.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I first see the function \\( G(x) = |x + 1| - |x - 1| \\), I notice that it involves absolute values. Absolute values can be tricky because they change based on whether the input is positive or negative. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Absolute Value Properties:** Maybe I can use the properties of absolute values to simplify parts of the function.\n- **Piecewise Functions:** Since absolute values change at certain points, perhaps breaking the function into intervals (piecewise) would help.\n- **Graphing:** I could also think about graphing the function to visually understand its behavior.\n- **Test Points:** Another approach is to evaluate the function at specific points to see how it behaves.\n\n**Wait...**\nBefore deciding, I remember that piecewise analysis often works well with absolute values because it allows me to handle each interval separately. Let me explore that first.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the Piecewise Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo handle the absolute values, I can consider different cases based on the value of \\( x \\). Specifically, I need to look at where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign.\n\n**Identifying Critical Points:**\n- The expression \\( |x + 1| \\) changes at \\( x = -1 \\).\n- The expression \\( |x - 1| \\) changes at \\( x = 1 \\).\n  \nSo, the critical points are \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\). These points divide the number line into three intervals: \n1. \\( x < -1 \\)\n2. \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\)\n3. \\( x \\geq 1 \\)\n\n**Wait...**\nHmm, thinking about it, breaking the function into these intervals makes sense because the behavior of absolute values changes around these points. Let's proceed with this strategy.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing Each Interval**\n\n**Interval 1: \\( x < -1 \\)**\n- Here, \\( x + 1 < 0 \\) and \\( x - 1 < 0 \\).\n  \n**Applying Absolute Values:**\n- \\( |x + 1| = -(x + 1) = -x - 1 \\)\n- \\( |x - 1| = -(x - 1) = -x + 1 \\)\n\n**Calculating \\( G(x) \\):**\n\\[\nG(x) = (-x - 1) - (-x + 1) = -x - 1 + x - 1 = -2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait a second\u2014no matter what \\( x \\) I pick in this range, \\( G(x) = -2 \\). That seems consistent, so I think this part is correct.\n\n**Interval 2: \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\)**\n- Here, \\( x + 1 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( x - 1 < 0 \\).\n  \n**Applying Absolute Values:**\n- \\( |x + 1| = x + 1 \\)\n- \\( |x - 1| = -(x - 1) = -x + 1 \\)\n\n**Calculating \\( G(x) \\):**\n\\[\nG(x) = (x + 1) - (-x + 1) = x + 1 + x - 1 = 2x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, so in this interval, \\( G(x) = 2x \\), which is a linear function. That makes sense because \\( x \\) is between \\( -1 \\) and \\( 1 \\).\n\n**Interval 3: \\( x \\geq 1 \\)**\n- Here, \\( x + 1 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( x - 1 \\geq 0 \\).\n  \n**Applying Absolute Values:**\n- \\( |x + 1| = x + 1 \\)\n- \\( |x - 1| = x - 1 \\)\n\n**Calculating \\( G(x) \\):**\n\\[\nG(x) = (x + 1) - (x - 1) = x + 1 - x + 1 = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo in this range, \\( G(x) = 2 \\). Again, that seems straightforward.\n\n### **Step 4: Compiling the Piecewise Function**\n\n**Combining Results:**\nBased on my analysis:\n\\[\nG(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \n-2 & \\text{if } x < -1 \\\\\n2x & \\text{if } -1 \\leq x < 1 \\\\\n2 & \\text{if } x \\geq 1 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n**Wait...**\nLet me double-check to ensure that at the boundaries (\\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\)), the function is defined correctly. \n\n**Checking Boundaries:**\n- At \\( x = -1 \\):\n  \\[\n  G(-1) = |-1 + 1| - |-1 - 1| = |0| - |-2| = 0 - 2 = -2\n  \\]\n  \n  According to the piecewise function, \\( G(-1) = 2(-1) = -2 \\). Matches!\n\n- At \\( x = 1 \\):\n  \\[\n  G(1) = |1 + 1| - |1 - 1| = |2| - |0| = 2 - 0 = 2\n  \\]\n  \n  According to the piecewise function, \\( G(1) = 2(1) = 2 \\). Matches!\n\n**Reflection:**\nPerfect! The boundaries align, so the piecewise function is correctly defined.\n\n### **Step 5: Determining the Range of \\( G(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have the piecewise function, I need to find the range\u2014essentially, the set of possible output values \\( G(x) \\) can take.\n\n**Analyzing Each Piece:**\n1. **For \\( x < -1 \\):** \n   - \\( G(x) = -2 \\). So, the output is always \\( -2 \\).\n\n2. **For \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\):** \n   - \\( G(x) = 2x \\). Since \\( x \\) ranges from \\( -1 \\) to \\( 1 \\), \\( G(x) \\) will take all values from \\( -2 \\) to \\( 2 \\), not including \\( 2 \\) because the upper limit is \\( x < 1 \\).\n\n3. **For \\( x \\geq 1 \\):** \n   - \\( G(x) = 2 \\). So, the output is always \\( 2 \\).\n\n**Wait...**\nI need to be careful here to ensure that there are no gaps in the range. Let's look at the endpoints more closely.\n\n**Checking Endpoints:**\n- **At \\( x = -1 \\):** \n  \\[\n  G(-1) = -2\n  \\]\n  \n- **At \\( x = 1 \\):** \n  \\[\n  G(1) = 2\n  \\]\n  \nBut according to the piecewise function, for \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\), \\( G(x) \\) approaches \\( 2 \\) but never actually reaches it until \\( x = 1 \\). However, since \\( x = 1 \\) falls into the third interval where \\( G(x) = 2 \\), there's no gap.\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, the range includes \\( -2 \\) and \\( 2 \\), and all values in between.\n\n### **Step 6: Expressing the Range in Interval Notation**\n\n**Writing the Range:**\nBased on my analysis, the range of \\( G(x) \\) is:\n\\[\n[-2, 2]\n\\]\n\n**Wait...**\nLet me verify that every number between \\( -2 \\) and \\( 2 \\) inclusive can be achieved by \\( G(x) \\).\n\n**Verification:**\n- **For \\( G(x) = -2 \\):** Achieved when \\( x < -1 \\).\n- **For \\( G(x) = 2 \\):** Achieved when \\( x \\geq 1 \\).\n- **For \\( -2 < G(x) < 2 \\):** Achieved when \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\).\n\nEverything checks out, so the range is indeed \\([-2, 2]\\).\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Correctness:** I carefully considered each interval and ensured that the boundaries were correctly handled. The piecewise function was correctly defined, and the range was accurately determined.\n- **Confidence:** I feel confident in the final result because I double-checked boundary values and ensured that there were no gaps in the range.\n- **Potential Mistakes:** Initially, I considered whether to graph the function, but sticking with the piecewise analysis proved effective. Checking boundary conditions ensured no oversight.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe range of the function \\( G(x) = |x + 1| - |x - 1| \\) is \\(\\boxed{[-2, 2]}\\).",
