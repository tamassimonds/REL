    "working_out": "Alright, let me dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nSo, we're dealing with a **right triangle** where:\n- The **hypotenuse** is 39 units.\n- All sides have **integer lengths**.\n- We need to find the length of the **shorter leg**.\n\nRight off the bat, this reminds me of the **Pythagorean theorem**, which states that in a right triangle:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the lengths of the legs,\n- \\( c \\) is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nGiven that the hypotenuse is 39, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = 39^2 = 1521\n\\]\n\nHmm, but I'm not immediately sure how to find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), especially since there are multiple right triangles with integer sides and a hypotenuse of 39.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List Possible Integer Pairs:**\n   - Maybe I can list out pairs of integers whose squares add up to 1521.\n   \n2. **Use the Pythagorean Triple Formula:**\n   - I recall there's a formula for generating Pythagorean triples. Perhaps using that could help.\n\n3. **Check Known Pythagorean Triples:**\n   - See if 39 is part of any well-known Pythagorean triples.\n\n4. **Factorization Approach:**\n   - Since \\( a^2 + b^2 = 1521 \\), perhaps factoring 1521 could reveal something.\n\nLet's start with **listing possible integer pairs** and see where that leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Listing Possible Integer Pairs**\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = 1521\n\\]\n\nI'll assume \\( a \\leq b \\) to focus on finding the **shorter leg** directly. This means \\( a \\) is the shorter leg we're looking for.\n\nIf \\( a \\leq b \\), then:\n\n\\[\na^2 \\leq b^2 \\implies a^2 \\leq 1521\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( a \\) must be less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{1521} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1521} = 39\n\\]\n\nWait, but since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are both less than the hypotenuse, \\( a \\) must be less than 39. I'll use \\( a \\leq 38 \\).\n\nNow, I'll list integer values of \\( a \\) from 1 to 38 and calculate \\( b^2 = 1521 - a^2 \\). Only if \\( b^2 \\) is a perfect square will \\( b \\) be an integer.\n\nLet me start with a few examples:\n\n- **For \\( a = 1 \\):**\n  \\[\n  b^2 = 1521 - 1^2 = 1520 \\quad (\\text{Not a perfect square})\n  \\]\n  \n- **For \\( a = 2 \\):**\n  \\[\n  b^2 = 1521 - 2^2 = 1517 \\quad (\\text{Not a perfect square})\n  \\]\n  \n- **Continuing this way...**\n\nI realize that checking each \\( a \\) manually is tedious and time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way? But for now, let's carry on for a bit to see if patterns emerge.\n\n- **For \\( a = 3 \\):**\n  \\[\n  b^2 = 1521 - 3^2 = 1512 \\quad (\\text{Not a perfect square})\n  \\]\n  \n- **For \\( a = 4 \\):**\n  \\[\n  b^2 = 1521 - 4^2 = 1505 \\quad (\\text{Not a perfect square})\n  \\]\n  \nThis isn't looking promising because none of these are perfect squares. Maybe I should consider the **Pythagorean triple formula** instead.\n\n### **Step 2: Using the Pythagorean Triple Formula**\n\nI vaguely remember that Pythagorean triples can be generated using:\n\n\\[\nm^2 - n^2, \\quad 2mn, \\quad m^2 + n^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers with \\( m > n \\).\n\nGiven that the hypotenuse \\( c = 39 \\), we need:\n\n\\[\nm^2 + n^2 = 39\n\\]\n\nBut wait, before jumping into this, let's check if 39 can be expressed as the sum of two squares.\n\nAccording to a theorem, a number can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if in its prime factorization, all primes of the form \\( 4k + 3 \\) have even exponents.\n\nLet me factorize 39:\n\n\\[\n39 = 3 \\times 13\n\\]\n\nBoth 3 and 13 are of the form \\( 4k + 3 \\). However, 39 is **not a perfect square**, and since both primes appear with **odd exponents**, 39 **cannot** be expressed as the sum of two squares.\n\nHmm, this suggests that there might not be any integer Pythagorean triple with a hypotenuse of 39. Is that possible?\n\n### **Reflection and Realization**\n\nWait a minute... If 39 can't be expressed as the sum of two squares, then it's likely that **no integer right triangle** exists with a hypotenuse of 39. This means that there **are no integer lengths** for the legs \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) that satisfy \\( a^2 + b^2 = 1521 \\).\n\nBut the question asks for the length of the shorter leg in such a triangle. If no such triangle exists, then the question might be flawed or misleading.\n\nAt this point, I feel like I need to **re-evaluate** the problem. Perhaps the question intends for us to find the leg lengths of a Pythagorean triple where 39 is the hypotenuse, even though such a triple might not exist because of the earlier observation.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Non-Existence of the Triangle**\n\nTo be certain, let's perform a quick check:\n\n- Recall that for a Pythagorean triple \\( a, b, c \\), \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\).\n- Given \\( c = 39 \\), we have \\( a^2 + b^2 = 1521 \\).\n- However, as per the earlier theorem, since 39 cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares, there are **no integer solutions** for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nThis confirms that **no integer right triangle** can have a hypotenuse of 39. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg \\( a \\) is **undefined** in this context.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nInitially, I thought there might be a Pythagorean triple involving 39, but after considering the properties of numbers expressible as the sum of two squares, it became clear that no such triangle exists.\n\nThroughout the process, I started by trying to list possible integer leg lengths and then shifted to considering the Pythagorean triple formula. Upon realizing that 39 can't be expressed as the sum of two squares, I concluded that there's no integer right triangle with a hypotenuse of 39.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**There is no right triangle with integer sides and a hypotenuse of 39.** Consequently, the length of the shorter leg is **undefined**.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous response. Let's dive back into the problem and re-examine my approach. I initially concluded that no integer right triangle exists with a hypotenuse of 39, but it seems that I overlooked some possibilities. Let's brainstorm different strategies again, explore various methods, and see where I went wrong.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-exploring the Problem:**\n\n**User Request:**  \nIn a right triangle with integer length sides, the hypotenuse has length 39 units. How many units is the length of the shorter leg?\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Listing Possible Integer Pairs:**  \n   - This was my initial approach, where I tried finding integer pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 1521\\) (since \\(39^2 = 1521\\)).\n   \n2. **Using the Pythagorean Triple Formula:**  \n   - Recall that Pythagorean triples can be generated using \\(m^2 - n^2\\), \\(2mn\\), and \\(m^2 + n^2\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers with \\(m > n\\).\n   \n3. **Checking Known Pythagorean Triples:**  \n   - Verifying if 39 is part of any well-known Pythagorean triples.\n\n4. **Looking for Multiples of Existing Pythagorean Triples:**  \n   - Considering that Pythagorean triples can be scaled by multiplying all sides by an integer.\n\nLet's start by **re-trying the listing approach** and see if any valid pairs emerge.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Re-attempting to List Possible Integer Pairs**\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = 1521\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\(a \\leq b\\), let's list integer values of \\(a\\) from 1 to 38 and calculate \\(b^2 = 1521 - a^2\\). Only if \\(b^2\\) is a perfect square will \\(b\\) be an integer.\n\n- **For \\(a = 1\\):**\n  \\[\n  b^2 = 1521 - 1^2 = 1520 \\quad (\\text{Not a perfect square})\n  \\]\n  \n- **For \\(a = 2\\):**\n  \\[\n  b^2 = 1521 - 2^2 = 1517 \\quad (\\text{Not a perfect square})\n  \\]\n  \n- **Continuing this way...**\n\nI realize that checking each \\(a\\) manually is tedious. Moreover, as I mentioned earlier, none of these are perfect squares. So, perhaps there's a different angle to explore.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Reflecting on the Pythagorean Triple Formula**\n\nI initially thought that since 39 can't be expressed as the sum of two squares, no integer right triangle exists. However, this might be an overgeneralization. Let me re-consider the **Pythagorean triple formula**:\n\n\\[\nc = m^2 + n^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad m > n\n\\]\n\nGiven that 39 is the hypotenuse, let's see if it can be part of a scaled Pythagorean triple.\n\nRecall that the smallest Pythagorean triple is \\(5^2 + 12^2 = 13^2\\). Multiplying each side by 3 gives:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 5 = 15,\\quad 3 \\times 12 = 36,\\quad 3 \\times 13 = 39\n\\]\n\nWait a second! This means that the triangle \\(15, 36, 39\\) is a **scaled version** of the \\(5, 12, 13\\) triple. Therefore, the shorter leg is **15 units**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Validating the Discovery**\n\nLet's validate this by checking if \\(15^2 + 36^2 = 39^2\\):\n\n\\[\n15^2 + 36^2 = 225 + 1296 = 1521 = 39^2\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that \\(15, 36, 39\\) indeed forms a Pythagorean triple. So, my initial conclusion was incorrect. There **is** a right triangle with integer sides and a hypotenuse of 39, and the length of the shorter leg is **15 units**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nInitially, I thought that no Pythagorean triple existed with a hypotenuse of 39 because 39 cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares. However, by reconsidering the Pythagorean triple formula and recognizing that 39 is a multiple of the hypotenuse in the \\(5, 12, 13\\) triple, I discovered that the triangle \\(15, 36, 39\\) does exist.\n\nThroughout the process, I started by attempting to list possible integer leg lengths but found it tedious and unproductive. Reflecting on the properties of Pythagorean triples led me to realize that scaling an existing triple could provide the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**The length of the shorter leg is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) units.**\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approaches**\n\n1. **Checking Multiples of Known Pythagorean Triples:**\n   - As demonstrated, recognizing that 39 is a multiple of 13 in the \\(5, 12, 13\\) triple allows us to scale the entire triple by 3.\n\n2. **Exploring Other Pythagorean Triples:**\n   - While the \\(5, 12, 13\\) triple is the most straightforward, it's also possible to explore larger multiples or different triples that might include 39, but in this case, the \\(15, 36, 39\\) triple suffices.\n\nBy brainstorming and re-examining my initial approach, I was able to identify and correct the oversight, leading to the correct solution.",
