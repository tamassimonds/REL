  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, emulating a natural human thought process. I'll walk through it as I would manually, brainstorming different strategies, checking along the way, and reflecting to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **Okay**, we need to find all values of \\( a \\) such that the four points \\( (0,0,0) \\), \\( (1,a,0) \\), \\( (0,1,a) \\), and \\( (a,0,1) \\) are coplanar.\n- **Coplanar** means all points lie on the same plane. I remember that if the volume of the tetrahedron formed by these points is zero, then they are coplanar.\n- **Hmm**, I also recall something about using determinants to check coplanarity. But which method would be more straightforward?\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Option 1:** Use the determinant method to check if the volume is zero.\n- **Option 2:** Express one point as a linear combination of the others.\n- **Option 3:** Use vector cross and dot products to ensure all vectors lie in the same plane.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The **determinant method** seems direct and familiar for checking coplanarity. **Let's start with that**, and if it gets messy, I can try another approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the Determinant Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To use the determinant method, I need to set up a matrix whose determinant equals zero if the points are coplanar.\n- I recall that for four points, constructing a **4x4 matrix** with an extra column of **ones** helps.\n\n**Setting Up the Matrix:**\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & a & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & a & 1 \\\\\na & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This makes sense because adding the column of ones allows us to handle **homogeneous coordinates**, ensuring the determinant represents volume.\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n- Expanding this determinant should give me an equation in terms of \\( a \\). Solving that equation will yield the values of \\( a \\) that make the determinant zero, indicating coplanarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Expanding the Determinant**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **Expanding a 4x4 determinant manually can be tedious**. Maybe I'll start by reducing the matrix or using **cofactor expansion** along a row or column with zeros to simplify.\n\n**Choosing a Strategy:**\n- Let's expand along the **first row** since it contains zeros, which should simplify the computation.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Expanding along the first row:\n  \\[\n  0 \\cdot \\text{{(minor)}} - 0 \\cdot \\text{{(minor)}} + 0 \\cdot \\text{{(minor)}} + 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} \n  1 & a & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  0 & 1 & a & 1 \\\\\n  a & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n  \\end{vmatrix}\n  \\]\n- So, I only need to compute the determinant of the remaining **3x3 matrix**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This is much better. Reducing the problem to a **3x3 determinant** makes it more manageable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Computing the 3x3 Determinant**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to expand this 3x3 determinant to get an equation in terms of \\( a \\).\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1 & a & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & a \\\\\na & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Using the formula for a 3x3 determinant:\n  \\[\n  1 \\cdot (1 \\cdot 1 - a \\cdot 0) - a \\cdot (0 \\cdot 1 - a \\cdot a) + 0 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot a)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 1(1) - a(-a^2) + 0 = 1 + a^3\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does this make sense? The determinant simplifies nicely to \\( 1 + a^3 \\). If \\( a = -1 \\), the determinant becomes zero, which **might be a solution**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The determinant being \\( 1 + a^3 \\) is straightforward. Setting this equal to zero will give me the values of \\( a \\) that make the points coplanar.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Equation \\( 1 + a^3 = 0 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to solve \\( 1 + a^3 = 0 \\) for \\( a \\).\n- This simplifies to \\( a^3 = -1 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\na = \\sqrt[3]{-1}\n\\]\n- I know that the cube root of \\(-1\\) has three solutions: the real root \\( a = -1 \\) and two **complex roots**.\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n- **Real Solution:** \\( a = -1 \\)\n- **Complex Solutions:** \n  \\[\n  a = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Since the problem involves geometric points with **real coordinates**, only the real solution \\( a = -1 \\) makes sense in this context.\n- However, it's good to acknowledge the complex solutions, even if they aren't applicable here.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Plugging \\( a = -1 \\) back into the points:\n  - \\( (1,-1,0) \\), \\( (0,1,-1) \\), \\( (-1,0,1) \\)\n- **Visually**, these points along with the origin seem to lie on the plane \\( x + y + z = 0 \\), confirming coplanarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing, let's verify by considering an **alternative method** to ensure correctness.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Alternative Method:** Use **vector operations**. Check if the vectors formed by the points are **linearly dependent**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- If vectors are linearly dependent, it confirms coplanarity. **Let's proceed with this** as a verification step.\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n- Consider vectors from the origin to the other points:\n  - \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 = (1,a,0) \\)\n  - \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 = (0,1,a) \\)\n  - \\( \\mathbf{v}_3 = (a,0,1) \\)\n- Check if there exist scalars \\( \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3 \\) (not all zero) such that:\n  \\[\n  \\lambda_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\lambda_2 \\mathbf{v}_2 + \\lambda_3 \\mathbf{v}_3 = \\mathbf{0}\n  \\]\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\\[\n\\lambda_1 (1,a,0) + \\lambda_2 (0,1,a) + \\lambda_3 (a,0,1) = (0,0,0)\n\\]\n- This results in the system of equations:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{cases}\n  \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_3 a = 0 \\\\\n  \\lambda_1 a + \\lambda_2 = 0 \\\\\n  \\lambda_2 a + \\lambda_3 = 0 \\\\\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n\n**Solving the System:**\n- Substitute \\( \\lambda_2 = -\\lambda_1 a \\) into the third equation:\n  \\[\n  -\\lambda_1 a^2 + \\lambda_3 = 0 \\implies \\lambda_3 = \\lambda_1 a^2\n  \\]\n- Substituting \\( \\lambda_3 = \\lambda_1 a^2 \\) into the first equation:\n  \\[\n  \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_1 a^3 = 0 \\implies \\lambda_1 (1 + a^3) = 0\n  \\]\n- Therefore, \\( \\lambda_1 = 0 \\) or \\( a^3 = -1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This aligns with our previous solution: \\( a^3 = -1 \\) implies \\( a = -1 \\).\n- If \\( \\lambda_1 = 0 \\), then from \\( \\lambda_2 = -\\lambda_1 a \\) and \\( \\lambda_3 = \\lambda_1 a^2 \\), both \\( \\lambda_2 \\) and \\( \\lambda_3 \\) are zero, which is **trivial**.\n- So, non-trivial solutions exist only when \\( a = -1 \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- The alternative method confirms that \\( a = -1 \\) is the only real solution ensuring coplanarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Both the determinant method and the vector linear dependence method point to \\( a = -1 \\) as the solution.\n- The complex solutions aren't applicable in the context of real coordinate geometry.\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n- **<ANSWER>**\n  - **Solution:** \\( a = -1 \\)\n- **<ENDANSWER>**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The problem is consistent across multiple methods, reinforcing the correctness of the solution.\n- It's essential to verify using different approaches to ensure no mistakes were made initially.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- By exploring the determinant method initially and verifying with vector linear dependence, we've confidently arrived at the solution.\n- It's crucial to brainstorm multiple strategies, check work frequently, and be open to adjusting the approach if needed.\n- Ensuring that the solution makes sense both algebraically and geometrically helps validate the correctness.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>\n- **Solution:** \\( a = -1 \\)\n</ANSWER>\n\n<ENDANSWER>\n\n---\n\nThis structured approach reflects a natural human thought process, incorporating brainstorming, checking, and verification through multiple methods to ensure the solution's correctness.",
