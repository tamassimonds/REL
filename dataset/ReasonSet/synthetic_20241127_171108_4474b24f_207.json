  "solution": "Absolutely, let's piece it all together into a cohesive solution while retaining the original insights and reflections. Here's how the problem-solving process unfolds:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We need to find the value of \\(a\\) such that the graph of \\(x + 2y + 3 = 0\\) is **perpendicular** to the graph of \\(ax + 2y + 3 = 0\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Perpendicular Lines:** My first thought is that this involves the slopes of the lines. I remember that for two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be \\(-1\\).\n  \n- **Standard Form:** Both equations are in the form \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\). Maybe I can extract the slopes from these.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Perhaps comparing coefficients or transforming the equations into slope-intercept form could help.\n\nI\u2019ll start by exploring the slope idea since that seems the most straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Find the Slopes of Both Lines**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo determine if two lines are perpendicular, their slopes must satisfy the condition that their product is \\(-1\\). So, I'll need to find the slopes of both equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Find the Slope of the First Equation**\n\n**Equation:**  \n\\[  \nx + 2y + 3 = 0  \n\\]  \n\n**Rearrange to Slope-Intercept Form \\((y = mx + b)\\):**  \n\\[  \n2y = -x - 3 \\quad \\text{(subtracting \\(x\\) and 3 from both sides)}  \n\\]  \n\\[  \ny = -\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{(dividing both sides by 2)}  \n\\]  \n\n**Slope \\((m_1)\\):**  \n\\[  \nm_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}  \n\\]  \n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat was straightforward. I now know the slope of the first line is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Find the Slope of the Second Equation**\n\n**Equation:**  \n\\[  \nax + 2y + 3 = 0  \n\\]  \n\n**Rearrange to Slope-Intercept Form:**  \n\\[  \n2y = -ax - 3 \\quad \\text{(subtracting \\(ax\\) and 3 from both sides)}  \n\\]  \n\\[  \ny = -\\frac{a}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{(dividing both sides by 2)}  \n\\]  \n\n**Slope \\((m_2)\\):**  \n\\[  \nm_2 = -\\frac{a}{2}  \n\\]  \n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, now I have both slopes:\n\n- First line: \\(m_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- Second line: \\(m_2 = -\\frac{a}{2}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Perpendicular Slope Condition**\n\n**Condition:**  \n\\[  \nm_1 \\times m_2 = -1  \n\\]  \n\nPlugging in the slopes:  \n\\[  \n\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right) = -1  \n\\]  \n\\[  \n\\frac{a}{4} = -1  \n\\]  \n\n**Solving for \\(a\\):**  \n\\[  \na = -1 \\times 4 = -4  \n\\]  \n\n**<ANSWER> a = -4 </ANSWER>**\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Multiply the slopes with \\(a = -4\\):  \n  \\[  \n  \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(-\\frac{-4}{2}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times 2 = -1  \n  \\]  \n  This satisfies the condition, so it seems correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis strategy worked well. By finding the slopes and applying the perpendicular condition, I arrived at \\(a = -4\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategies**\n\nEven though the first strategy worked, let's briefly consider other methods to ensure completeness and verify the solution.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Comparing Coefficients**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe comparing the coefficients of the equations could provide another path. However, this approach is less direct for perpendicularity conditions. Generally, coefficient comparison works better for parallel lines or identical equations.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\n- Looking at the equations:  \n  \\[  \n  x + 2y + 3 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad ax + 2y + 3 = 0  \n  \\]  \n- The coefficients of \\(y\\) and the constant terms are the same.\n- The difference lies in the coefficient of \\(x\\): 1 versus \\(a\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis method doesn't directly lead to the perpendicular condition unless combined with slope considerations. It seems less efficient than the first strategy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStick with Strategy 1, as it directly applies the perpendicular slope condition and leads to the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's double-check the calculations to ensure everything is correct.\n\n**Revisiting the Slope Calculation:**\n\n- **First Equation:**  \n  \\[  \n  y = -\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} \\implies m_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}  \n  \\]  \n- **Second Equation (with \\(a = -4\\)):**  \n  \\[  \n  y = -\\frac{-4}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} = 2x - \\frac{3}{2} \\implies m_2 = 2  \n  \\]  \n\n**Perpendicular Condition:**  \n\\[  \nm_1 \\times m_2 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = -1  \n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe condition is satisfied, confirming that \\(a = -4\\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n**<ANSWER> solution: a = -4 </ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Requirement:** Recognizing that perpendicular lines have slopes whose product is \\(-1\\).\n\n2. **Calculating Slopes:** Transforming both equations into slope-intercept form to easily identify their slopes.\n\n3. **Applying the Condition:** Setting up the equation based on the perpendicular condition and solving for \\(a\\).\n\n4. **Verification:** Performing a quick check to ensure the solution satisfies the condition.\n\nExploring an alternative strategy helped affirm that the initial approach was the most efficient. This thorough process ensures that the solution is both correct and well-understood.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThrough careful analysis and reflection, we've determined that the value of \\(a\\) that makes the two lines perpendicular is **\\(a = -4\\)**.\n\n---\n\nThere you have it! By systematically exploring and verifying our strategies, we've confidently arrived at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "Since they are perpendicular, their slopes must multiply to -1. The first line has slope $-\\frac12$ and the second $-\\frac{a}{2}$, so $\\frac{a}{4}=-1$ and $a=\\boxed{-4}$."
