  "problem": "A ''super ball'' is dropped from a window 16 meters above the ground. On each bounce it rises $\\frac34$ the distance of the preceding high point. The ball is caught when it reached the high point after hitting the ground for the third time. To the nearest meter, how far has it travelled?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I would naturally tackle it\u2014exploring different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting as needed. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d work through it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen I first read the question, it reminds me of problems involving **geometric sequences** because the ball's bounce height decreases by a fixed ratio each time. But wait, it's also about calculating the total distance traveled, which includes both the **up** and **down** paths.\n\nI think I need to account for each bounce's ascent and descent until the ball is caught. Maybe setting up a series to sum these distances would work. Let's explore this idea.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Geometric Series Approach:**\n   - Use a geometric series to sum up the bounce heights.\n   - Calculate both the ascent and descent for each bounce.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n   - Manually compute each bounce's height and corresponding travel distance.\n   - Sum them up to get the total distance.\n\n3. **Visualizing the Motion:**\n   - Draw a diagram to better understand the bounces and distances involved.\n\nI think starting with the **step-by-step calculation** might give me a clearer picture. If it gets too messy, I can switch to using a geometric series.\n\n---\n\n### **Starting with Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nLet\u2019s compute each part meticulously:\n\n#### **Step 1: Initial Drop**\n\n- **Height:** 16 meters (straight down to the ground)\n- **Distance Traveled:** 16 meters\n\n**Thought:** Okay, the first drop is straightforward\u2014just the height from which it's dropped.\n\n#### **Quick Check:**\n\nDoes it make sense? Yes, the ball travels 16 meters straight down initially.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: First Bounce**\n\n- **Bounce Back Height:** \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 16 = 12\\) meters\n\n**Reflection:** So, after the first bounce, it rises to 12 meters. Now, it needs to travel **up** and then **down** again.\n\n- **Distance Traveled:** \n  - Up: 12 meters\n  - Down: 12 meters\n  - **Total for First Bounce:** \\(12 + 12 = 24\\) meters\n\n**Thought:** Adding both ascent and descent makes sense here.\n\n#### **Quick Check:**\n\nTotal so far: \\(16 + 24 = 40\\) meters. \n\nDoes this seem reasonable? Yeah, the ball has made its first complete cycle.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Second Bounce**\n\n- **Bounce Back Height:** \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 12 = 9\\) meters\n\n**Reflection:** Continuing the pattern, it rises to 9 meters.\n\n- **Distance Traveled:** \n  - Up: 9 meters\n  - Down: 9 meters\n  - **Total for Second Bounce:** \\(9 + 9 = 18\\) meters\n\n**Thought:** Repeating the process for the second bounce.\n\n#### **Quick Check:**\n\nTotal so far: \\(40 + 18 = 58\\) meters.\n\nStill makes sense? Yes, the distances are decreasing as expected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Third Bounce**\n\n- **Bounce Back Height:** \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 9 = 6.75\\) meters\n\n**Reflection:** Now, for the third bounce, it rises to 6.75 meters.\n\n- **Distance Traveled:** \n  - Up: 6.75 meters\n  - **(No down this time since it's caught at the top)**\n\n**Thought:** The ball is caught after the third ascent, so no descent this time.\n\n- **Total for Third Bounce:** 6.75 meters\n\n---\n\n#### **Final Calculation:**\n\nTotal distance traveled:  \n\\[ 16 + 24 + 18 + 6.75 = 64.75 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, the problem asks for the nearest meter. So, I need to round this.\n\n#### **Rounding:**\n\n\\[ 64.75 \\approx 65 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n**Thought:** Rounding up makes sense here since 0.75 is closer to 1.\n\n#### **Final Check:**\n\nDoes this total seem plausible? Considering the decreasing bounce heights and the number of bounces, 65 meters feels right.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Geometric Series**\n\nJust to confirm, let's see if using a geometric series aligns with our step-by-step method.\n\n- **Total Ascent and Descent (except the last ascent):**\n  - First Bounce: 12 meters up and down\n  - Second Bounce: 9 meters up and down\n  - Third Bounce: 6.75 meters up (caught here)\n\n**Setting Up the Series:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Distance} = 16 + 2(12) + 2(9) + 6.75 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ 16 + 24 + 18 + 6.75 = 64.75 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nRounding:\n\n\\[ 64.75 \\approx 65 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Both methods agree, which reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter thoroughly exploring and verifying both strategies, the total distance traveled by the ball is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Initial Drop:** 16 meters\n- **First Bounce:** 24 meters (12 up and down)\n- **Second Bounce:** 18 meters (9 up and down)\n- **Third Bounce:** 6.75 meters (up only)\n- **Total:** 64.75 meters, rounded to **65 meters**\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, reflecting, and verifying through multiple methods, I've ensured the accuracy of the solution.\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "The ball traveled $16+16\\cdot\\frac34+16\\cdot\\left(\\frac34\\right)^2 = 16+ 12+9 = 37$ meters on its three descents. The ball also traveled $16\\cdot\\frac34+16\\cdot\\left(\\frac34\\right)^2+16\\cdot\\left(\\frac34\\right)^3 = 12+9+\\frac{27}4 = 27.75$ meters on its three ascents. Thus, the ball traveled $37+27.75 = 64.75 \\approx \\boxed{65}$ meters total."
