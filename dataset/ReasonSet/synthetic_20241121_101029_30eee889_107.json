I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, so we have a segment \\( AB \\) with endpoints \\( A(2, -2) \\) and \\( B(14, 4) \\). This segment is extended through \\( B \\) to a point \\( C \\), and we're told that \\( BC \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of \\( AB \\). The goal is to find the coordinates of point \\( C \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Wait a minute**, this sounds like a problem involving extending a line segment. I've encountered similar problems before where proportions along a line are involved.\n- **Maybe** I can use vectors to find the direction from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) and then extend that direction to find \\( C \\).\n- Alternatively, **I could calculate the length of \\( AB \\)** and then determine \\( BC \\) to find \\( C \\). \n- **Hmm**, using the slope of \\( AB \\) might also help to extend the line.\n  \n**At First Glance:** Using vectors seems like a straightforward approach, but let's explore different strategies to ensure it's the best method.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Vector Approach:**\n   - Calculate the vector from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n   - Extend this vector by \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) its length to find \\( C \\).\n\n2. **Slope Method:**\n   - Find the slope of line \\( AB \\).\n   - Use the slope to extend the line through \\( B \\) by the required distance.\n\n3. **Distance Calculation:**\n   - Compute the length of \\( AB \\).\n   - Find \\( BC = \\frac{1}{3} \\times AB \\).\n   - Use the ratio to determine \\( C \\).\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n- **The vector approach** seems efficient because it directly deals with direction and magnitude.\n- **The slope method** is also valid but might involve more computations.\n- **Distance calculation** could work but feels more tedious.\n\n**Decision:** I'll **start with the vector approach** since it seems the most straightforward. If it doesn't work, I'll pivot to another method.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Vector \\( \\mathbf{AB} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To extend the segment, I need to know the direction from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n- **Vector \\( \\mathbf{AB} \\)** can be found by subtracting coordinates of \\( A \\) from \\( B \\).\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{AB} = B - A = (14 - 2, 4 - (-2)) = (12, 6)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait, let me double-check this:**  \n  \\( 14 - 2 = 12 \\)  \n  \\( 4 - (-2) = 6 \\)  \n- **Yep, that looks correct.**\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Vector \\( \\mathbf{BC} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since \\( BC = \\frac{1}{3} \\times AB \\), I need to scale the vector \\( \\mathbf{AB} \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{BC} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\mathbf{AB} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 12, \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6\\right) = (4, 2)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Quick check:**  \n  \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4 \\)  \n  \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2 \\)  \n- **That seems correct.**\n\n### **Step 3: Find Coordinates of Point \\( C \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find \\( C \\), I need to add vector \\( \\mathbf{BC} \\) to point \\( B \\).\n- Essentially, moving from \\( B \\) by \\( \\mathbf{BC} \\).\n\n\\[\nC = B + \\mathbf{BC} = (14 + 4, 4 + 2) = (18, 6)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Let me verify this:**  \n  \\( 14 + 4 = 18 \\)  \n  \\( 4 + 2 = 6 \\)  \n- **It checks out.**\n\n### **Intermediate Check: Does This Make Sense?**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Is \\( C \\) really extending \\( AB \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) its length?**\n- Maybe I should **calculate the lengths** to ensure the proportions are correct.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- First, find the length of \\( AB \\):\n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{(14 - 2)^2 + (4 - (-2))^2} = \\sqrt{12^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 36} = \\sqrt{180} \\approx 13.42\n\\]\n\n- Then, calculate \\( BC \\):\n\n\\[\nBC = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 13.42 \\approx 4.47\n\\]\n\n- Now, check the distance from \\( B \\) to \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\nBC_{\\text{calculated}} = \\sqrt{(18 - 14)^2 + (6 - 4)^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 4} = \\sqrt{20} \\approx 4.47\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait a second, let's confirm:**  \n  \\( \\sqrt{20} \\approx 4.47 \\)  \n- **Yes, the calculated \\( BC \\) matches the expected \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times AB \\).**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Looks good!** The coordinates \\( C(18, 6) \\) are correct.\n\n### **Alternate Strategy Check: Using the Slope Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Just to be sure**, let's briefly consider the slope method to see if it leads to the same result.\n- Find the slope \\( m \\) of \\( AB \\):\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{4 - (-2)}{14 - 2} = \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n- Use the slope to extend \\( AB \\) through \\( B \\) by \\( BC = \\frac{1}{3} \\times AB \\approx 4.47 \\).\n- Calculate the change in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) based on the slope:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta x = \\frac{4.47}{\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{4.47}{\\sqrt{1.25}} \\approx 4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta y = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\Delta x \\approx 2\n\\]\n\n- Add these changes to \\( B \\):\n\n\\[\nC = (14 + 4, 4 + 2) = (18, 6)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Interesting!** Both methods agree, which **reassures me** that the solution is correct.\n\n### **Final Check: Validating the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Before finalizing**, let's ensure all steps are logical and calculations are accurate.\n- Both the vector and slope methods yield the same coordinates for \\( C \\).\n- Length proportions are verified to be correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Everything checks out.** The approach and calculations are valid.\n\n**<ANSWER>**  \nC(18, 6)  \n**</ANSWER>**\n\n### **Recap and Final Answer**\n\nBy using the vector approach, we extended segment \\( AB \\) through \\( B \\) to point \\( C \\), ensuring that \\( BC = \\frac{1}{3} \\times AB \\). All calculations were verified, and an alternate method confirmed the result.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**<ANSWER>**  \nC(18, 6)  \n**</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- **Thinking back,** starting with the vector approach was efficient and straightforward.\n- **Checking with an alternate method** added confidence to the solution.\n- **Validating the proportions** ensured that the extension was correctly applied.\n\n**Overall, approaching the problem step-by-step**, brainstorming multiple strategies, and constantly verifying calculations led to a reliable and accurate solution.\n\n**<MODEL END>**",
