We'll ensure the final answer remains unchanged, reflecting the authentic problem-solving journey.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**Question:**  \nFind the product of all integer divisors of \\(105\\) that also divide \\(14\\).  \n*(Recall that the divisors of an integer may be positive or negative.)*\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \n- This involves finding common divisors of \\(105\\) and \\(14\\).  \n- Including negative divisors adds an extra layer of complexity.  \n\n**Initial Reflection:**  \n- Not entirely sure where to start, but exploring different strategies might help.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **List All Divisors of Both Numbers and Find Common Ones:**  \n   - This could work for smaller numbers, but might be time-consuming.\n\n2. **Use Prime Factorization to Identify Common Divisors:**  \n   - A more systematic approach that can streamline the process.\n\n3. **Utilize the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**  \n   - Knowing that all divisors of the GCD divide both numbers could be helpful.\n\n**Decision:**  \n- **Start with Strategy 2 (Prime Factorization).**  \n  - If it gets messy, consider switching to another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n**Prime Factorization of \\(105\\):**\n\n- **Break Down \\(105\\):**  \n  -
