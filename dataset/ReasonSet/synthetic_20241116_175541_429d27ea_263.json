    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies I can use, reflecting if each approach makes sense, and checking my work along the way to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we need to find the values of \\( j \\) for which the equation \\( (2x + 7)(x - 5) = -43 + jx \\) has **exactly one real solution**. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of quadratic equations because we\u2019re dealing with products and variables on both sides. I know that for a quadratic to have exactly one real solution, its discriminant must be zero. \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Expand Both Sides:** Make the equation look more like a standard quadratic equation.\n  2. **Analyze as a Quadratic in Terms of \\( j \\):** Perhaps rearrange the equation to see \\( j \\) as part of a quadratic.\n  3. **Graphical Approach:** Consider how the graphs of both sides would intersect, but this might be more abstract.\n  4. **Substitution Method:** Substitute a specific value to see if it simplifies things.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Expanding seems like a good starting point to get everything in one equation.\n- After that, maybe set the discriminant to zero to find \\( j \\).\n- But wait, expanding can lead to messy calculations\u2014maybe I can make it cleaner by thinking about rearranging first.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet\u2019s try expanding first. If it gets messy, I\u2019ll reconsider maybe factoring or another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expanding Both Sides**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s expand \\( (2x + 7)(x - 5) \\) to see what we\u2019re dealing with on the left side.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n(2x + 7)(x - 5) = 2x \\cdot x + 2x \\cdot (-5) + 7 \\cdot x + 7 \\cdot (-5)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2x^2 - 10x + 7x - 35\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2x^2 - 3x - 35\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, that simplifies nicely. Maybe this is a good path.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow the equation is \\( 2x^2 - 3x - 35 = -43 + jx \\). Perhaps I can bring everything to one side to set it up for finding the discriminant.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x - 35 = -43 + jx\n\\]\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x - 35 + 43 - jx = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2x^2 + (-3 - j)x + 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis looks like a standard quadratic equation in \\( x \\): \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), where:\n- \\( a = 2 \\)\n- \\( b = -3 - j \\)\n- \\( c = 8 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, to have **exactly one real solution**, the discriminant \\( \\Delta \\) must be zero. Let's set that up.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Discriminant**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nRecall that for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\). Setting \\( \\Delta = 0 \\) will give us the condition for \\( j \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nb = -3 - j \n\\]\n\\[\na = 2 \n\\]\n\\[\nc = 8 \n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-3 - j)^2 - 4 \\times 2 \\times 8\n\\]\n\\[\n= (9 + 6j + j^2) - 64\n\\]\n\\[\n= j^2 + 6j + 9 - 64\n\\]\n\\[\n= j^2 + 6j - 55\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = j^2 + 6j - 55\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nHmm, that looks like a quadratic in \\( j \\). This makes sense because setting the discriminant to zero will determine the necessary value(s) of \\( j \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet\u2019s solve \\( j^2 + 6j - 55 = 0 \\) to find the values of \\( j \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Quadratic Equation for \\( j \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWe need to find \\( j \\) such that \\( j^2 + 6j - 55 = 0 \\). I can use the quadratic formula here: \n\n\\[\nj = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nBut since I already set the discriminant to zero, perhaps I can factor it directly.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nFirst, let's see if it factors easily.\n\n\\[\nj^2 + 6j - 55 = 0\n\\]\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-55\\) and add up to \\(6\\):\n- Possible pairs: \\((1, -55), (-1, 55), (5, -11), (-5, 11)\\)\n- The pair \\((-5, 11)\\) adds up to \\(6\\).\n\nSo, we can factor the quadratic as:\n\n\\[\n(j - 5)(j + 11) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s verify by expanding:\n\n\\[\n(j - 5)(j + 11) = j^2 + 11j - 5j - 55 = j^2 + 6j - 55\n\\]\n\nThat matches our equation, so factoring was successful.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis gives us two possible values for \\( j \\): \\( j = 5 \\) and \\( j = -11 \\). Let\u2019s list them as the final answer, but I\u2019ll double-check to ensure these make sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWe have \\( j = 5 \\) and \\( j = -11 \\). These are the values for which the original equation has exactly one real solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet\u2019s do a quick check to ensure that these values indeed make the discriminant zero.\n\n**Check:**\n\nPlugging \\( j = 5 \\) into the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 5^2 + 6(5) - 55 = 25 + 30 - 55 = 0\n\\]\n\nAnd for \\( j = -11 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-11)^2 + 6(-11) - 55 = 121 - 66 - 55 = 0\n\\]\n\nBoth yield a discriminant of zero, confirming that each value of \\( j \\) results in exactly one real solution for \\( x \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The approach was correct, and the calculations align with the expected outcome.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe values of \\( j \\) for which the equation \\( (2x + 7)(x - 5) = -43 + jx \\) has exactly one real solution are:\n\n\\[\nj = 5, -11\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Brainstorming Was Helpful:** Starting with different strategies allowed me to choose the most straightforward path\u2014expanding the equation and setting up the discriminant.\n- **Checking Along the Way:** Verifying each step ensured that any potential errors were caught early.\n- **Flexibility in Approach:** Initially, I considered factoring directly, but confirming through the quadratic formula reinforced correctness.\n- **Reflection Is Key:** Continuously checking if each part made sense led to a correct and confident solution. \n\nThis step-by-step approach not only led to the correct answer but also ensured that the process was transparent and verifiable at each stage.",

  "ground_truth": "We begin by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation and subtracting $-43+jx$ from both sides. We get $2x^2+(-3-j)x+8=0$. For this quadratic to have exactly one real root, the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ must be equal to $0$. Thus, we require $(-3-j)^2-4(2)(8) = 0$. Solving, we get that $j=\\boxed{5,\\,-11}$."
