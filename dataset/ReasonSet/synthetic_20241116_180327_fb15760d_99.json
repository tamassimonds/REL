I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work to ensure it makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have a square \\( ABCD \\) with its center at \\( (8, -8) \\) and an area of 4 square units. The top side of the square is horizontal. Then, this square is dilated with center at \\( (0, 0) \\) and a scale factor of 2. We need to find the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square \\( ABCD \\) that is farthest from the origin.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Wait, I remember dealing with squares and dilations before...**  \n  I think, with dilations, the distances from the center of dilation to the vertices change based on the scale factor. So, understanding the original square's dimensions and how dilation affects them is key.\n\n- **Hmm, should I draw this out?**  \n  Maybe visualizing the square and the dilation would help. Seeing it might clarify how far each vertex moves.\n\n- **Is there a formula for dilation?**  \n  I recall the dilation formula scales the coordinates of points relative to the center. But since the center of dilation is at the origin, the math might get a bit tricky.\n\n- **How do I find the farthest vertex post-dilation?**  \n  After dilation, the new position of each vertex will be scaled. I need to calculate which of these new vertices is farthest from the origin.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Original Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nOkay, the area of square \\( ABCD \\) is given as 4 square units. I know that the area \\( A \\) of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one side \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\nA = s^2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\ns^2 = 4 \\implies s = \\sqrt{4} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n**Does this make sense?**  \nYes, the side length is 2 units. That seems reasonable for a square with an area of 4.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nThinking about a square with side length 2, its area would indeed be \\( 2^2 = 4 \\). So, this checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Find the Coordinates of the Original Square's Vertices**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince the square is centered at \\( (8, -8) \\) and has a side length of 2, I need to determine the positions of its vertices. Given that the top side is horizontal, the square is aligned with the coordinate axes.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- The distance from the center to each vertex is half the side length:  \n  \\(\\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\\)\n\n- Therefore, the vertices are 1 unit away from the center in each direction:  \n  - Top-right: \\( (8 + 1, -8 + 1) = (9, -7) \\)\n  - Top-left: \\( (8 - 1, -8 + 1) = (7, -7) \\)\n  - Bottom-left: \\( (8 - 1, -8 - 1) = (7, -9) \\)\n  - Bottom-right: \\( (8 + 1, -8 - 1) = (9, -9) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n**Does this layout seem correct?**  \nYes, with the center at \\( (8, -8) \\) and a side length of 2, moving 1 unit in each direction makes sense.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nVisualizing the square, the vertices should be 1 unit from the center in both x and y directions. Placing them at \\( (9, -7) \\), \\( (7, -7) \\), \\( (7, -9) \\), and \\( (9, -9) \\) looks right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Dilation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, the square is dilated with the center at \\( (0, 0) \\) and a scale factor of 2. I remember that dilation transforms each point \\( (x, y) \\) to \\( (kx, ky) \\), where \\( k \\) is the scale factor.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's apply this to each vertex:\n\n1. **Top-right:**  \n   \\[\n   (9, -7) \\rightarrow (2 \\times 9, 2 \\times -7) = (18, -14)\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Top-left:**  \n   \\[\n   (7, -7) \\rightarrow (2 \\times 7, 2 \\times -7) = (14, -14)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Bottom-left:**  \n   \\[\n   (7, -9) \\rightarrow (2 \\times 7, 2 \\times -9) = (14, -18)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Bottom-right:**  \n   \\[\n   (9, -9) \\rightarrow (2 \\times 9, 2 \\times -9) = (18, -18)\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n**Wait, let me think about this...**  \nIs the center of dilation at the origin (\\(0, 0\\))? Yes, so the dilation scales the distances from the origin. Each vertex's coordinates are multiplied by 2, which seems correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nMultiplying each coordinate by 2 should move each vertex away from the origin, making the square larger. For example, \\( (9, -7) \\) becomes \\( (18, -14) \\), which is twice as far from the origin.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Farthest Vertex from the Origin**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we have the coordinates of the dilated square's vertices, I need to find which vertex is farthest from the origin. To do this, I'll calculate the distance of each vertex from the origin using the distance formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's calculate the distance for each vertex:\n\n1. **Top-right:**  \n   \\[\n   (18, -14) \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{(18)^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{324 + 196} = \\sqrt{520} \\approx 22.8\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Top-left:**  \n   \\[\n   (14, -14) \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{(14)^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 196} = \\sqrt{392} \\approx 19.8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Bottom-left:**  \n   \\[\n   (14, -18) \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{(14)^2 + (-18)^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 324} = \\sqrt{520} \\approx 22.8\n   \\]\n\n4. **Bottom-right:**  \n   \\[\n   (18, -18) \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{(18)^2 + (-18)^2} = \\sqrt{324 + 324} = \\sqrt{648} \\approx 25.5\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n**Hmm, let me double-check these distances...**  \nI remember that the distance from the origin increases with the dilation scale factor. The calculations seem correct, and the vertex at \\( (18, -18) \\) has the largest distance.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nComparing the distances, \\( \\sqrt{648} \\approx 25.5 \\) is indeed larger than the others. So, the vertex \\( (18, -18) \\) is the farthest from the origin.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAfter applying the dilation and calculating the distances of each vertex from the origin, it's clear that the vertex farthest from the origin is \\( (18, -18) \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(18, -18)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n**Does this answer align with everything I've worked through?**  \nYes, all steps lead logically to this conclusion. The dilation was applied correctly, and the distances were calculated accurately.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Wait, let me review the entire process...**  \n- **Brainstorming helped identify the key steps:** Determining the side length, finding the vertices, applying dilation, and calculating distances.\n- **Reflections throughout ensured correctness:** Each step was checked before moving on.\n- **Quick checks confirmed calculations:** Distances were accurately computed, leading to the correct farthest vertex.\n\n**Random Insight:**  \nThinking back, visualizing the square and its dilation was beneficial. It made understanding the transformations clearer and helped catch any potential mistakes early.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nApproaching the problem step-by-step and continuously checking my work led to the correct identification of the farthest vertex post-dilation.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer Reaffirmed:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(18, -18)}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThat's how I would tackle this problem, reflecting and checking at each stage to ensure the solution's accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "With the center of dilation at the origin and a scale factor of 2, all the coordinates of square $ABCD$ are twice the coordinates of its preimage. The preimage has an area of 4 square units, so its side length is 2 units. Since the center of the preimage is at $(8, -8)$, the four vertices of the preimage are at $(7, -9), (7, -7), (9, -7)$ and $(9, -9)$. The point $(9, -9)$ is the farthest from the origin on the preimage, so the point farthest from the origin on the image of square $ABCD$ is $\\boxed{(18, -18)}.$"
