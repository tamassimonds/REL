  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this question: **Is it possible for a negative number to have a square root?**\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, at first glance, this reminds me of high school math. I recall something about square roots and negative numbers possibly involving imaginary numbers, but it's been a while. Let's brainstorm different strategies to tackle this and see which one works best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Explore Square Roots with Real Numbers Only:**\n   - Think about whether negative numbers have square roots within the real number system.\n\n2. **Consider Complex Numbers:**\n   - Maybe negative numbers have square roots if we expand to complex numbers.\n\n3. **Use Graphical Representation:**\n   - Visualize the square root function to see what happens with negative inputs.\n\n4. **Apply Algebraic Proof:**\n   - Attempt to prove or disprove it algebraically.\n\nI\u2019m not sure which strategy will be the most straightforward, so I'll start with the first one and see where it takes me.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Square Roots in the Real Number System**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s consider the square root definition in the real numbers. I recall that the square root of a number \\( x \\) is a number \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = x \\). So, if \\( x \\) is negative, we\u2019re looking for a real number \\( y \\) whose square is negative.\n\n**Initial Calculation:**\n\n- If \\( y^2 = -9 \\), then \\( y \\times y = -9 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute. Multiplying two positive numbers gives a positive result, and multiplying two negative numbers also gives a positive result. So, in the real number system, \\( y^2 \\) is always non-negative.\n\n**Conclusion for Real Numbers:**\n\n<ANSWER>\nIn the real number system, negative numbers do not have square roots because no real number squared gives a negative result.\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis aligns with my initial recollection. But let\u2019s not stop here\u2014perhaps expanding our view to complex numbers will yield a different insight.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering Complex Numbers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI remember that complex numbers might come into play here. Complex numbers include the imaginary unit \\( i \\), where \\( i^2 = -1 \\). Maybe this is where negative numbers can have square roots.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- Let\u2019s take \\( x = -9 \\).\n- Can we find a number \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = -9 \\)?\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Suppose \\( y = a + bi \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\n- Then:\n  \\[\n  y^2 = (a + bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi + (bi)^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2abi\n  \\]\n  \n- We want:\n  \\[\n  a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = -9\n  \\]\n  \n- To satisfy this equation, split into real and imaginary parts:\n  - Real part: \\( a^2 - b^2 = -9 \\)\n  - Imaginary part: \\( 2ab = 0 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFrom \\( 2ab = 0 \\), either \\( a = 0 \\) or \\( b = 0 \\). But if \\( b = 0 \\), we\u2019re back to real numbers, which doesn\u2019t work. So, \\( a = 0 \\).\n\n**Simplified Calculation:**\n\n- If \\( a = 0 \\), then:\n  \\[\n  -b^2 = -9 \\implies b^2 = 9 \\implies b = \\pm 3\n  \\]\n  \n- Therefore, \\( y = 0 \\pm 3i \\) or simply \\( y = \\pm 3i \\).\n\n**Conclusion for Complex Numbers:**\n\n<ANSWER>\nIn the complex number system, negative numbers do have square roots. For example, the square roots of \\(-9\\) are \\(3i\\) and \\(-3i\\).\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- \\( (3i)^2 = 9i^2 = 9(-1) = -9 \\)\n- \\( (-3i)^2 = 9i^2 = 9(-1) = -9 \\) \n\nThis checks out! So, within the complex number system, negative numbers indeed have square roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Using Graphical Representation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe visualizing the square root function could provide additional insight. I\u2019ll consider the graph of \\( y = \\sqrt{x} \\) and see what happens for negative \\( x \\).\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- In the real number system, the graph of \\( y = \\sqrt{x} \\) only exists for \\( x \\geq 0 \\) because square roots of negative numbers aren\u2019t defined.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms our earlier conclusion for real numbers: negative \\( x \\) doesn\u2019t have real square roots. However, in the complex plane, the function can be extended to include negative \\( x \\) by introducing imaginary components.\n\n**Conclusion from Graphical Representation:**\n\n<ANSWER>\nGraphically, in the real number system, negative numbers do not have square roots. However, extending to the complex plane allows for square roots of negative numbers through imaginary components.\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis aligns with both the algebraic approach and my initial thoughts. The graphical method supports our conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Applying Algebraic Proof**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s attempt a formal proof to solidify our understanding. If we can prove that no real number squared equals a negative number, it would confirm our earlier findings.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n- Assume \\( y^2 = x \\), where \\( x \\) is negative.\n\n- For any real number \\( y \\):\n  - If \\( y > 0 \\), then \\( y^2 > 0 \\).\n  - If \\( y = 0 \\), then \\( y^2 = 0 \\).\n  - If \\( y < 0 \\), then \\( y^2 > 0 \\).\n\n- Therefore, \\( y^2 \\geq 0 \\) for all real \\( y \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n<ANSWER>\nIn the real number system, \\( y^2 \\) is always non-negative. Therefore, no real number squared equals a negative number, confirming that negative numbers do not have real square roots.\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis proof aligns perfectly with our earlier explorations. It provides a rigorous confirmation that within the real numbers, negative numbers lack square roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nI initially suspected that negative numbers might not have square roots in the real number system but could have them in the complex number system. Exploring multiple strategies\u2014real numbers, complex numbers, graphical representation, and algebraic proof\u2014helped validate this intuition.\n\nEach approach consistently led to the same conclusion:\n\n- **Real Number System:** Negative numbers do not have square roots.\n- **Complex Number System:** Negative numbers do have square roots, involving imaginary numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\nNegative numbers do not have square roots within the real number system. However, in the complex number system, negative numbers do have square roots, which are expressed as imaginary numbers. For example, the square roots of \\(-9\\) are \\(3i\\) and \\(-3i\\).\n</ANSWER>\n\nBy systematically exploring different methods and reflecting at each step, I've confirmed that negative numbers can have square roots, but only within the complex number system.\n\n---",
