    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Just like tackling any real-world issue, I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their validity, and adjust my approach as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about a right triangle with integer side lengths, where the hypotenuse is 39 units. I need to find the length of the shorter leg. \n\nRight off the bat, this reminds me of the **Pythagorean theorem**, which states:\n\n\\[ \na^2 + b^2 = c^2 \n\\]\n\nwhere \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the other two legs. Given that the hypotenuse is 39, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \na^2 + b^2 = 39^2 \n\\]\n\nBut wait, I don\u2019t know the lengths of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) individually\u2014only that they are integers and one is shorter than the other.\n\nHmm\u2026 I'm thinking there are a few ways to approach this:\n\n1. **List Integer Pairs**: Generate all possible integer pairs \\( (a, b) \\) such that \\( a^2 + b^2 = 1521 \\) (since \\(39^2 = 1521\\)).\n   \n2. **Use Pythagorean Triples Knowledge**: Recall known Pythagorean triples and see if 39 fits into any of them.\n\n3. **Algebraic Rearrangement**: Rearrange the Pythagorean theorem to find relationships between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n4. **Graphical Interpretation**: Visualize or graph the equation to see integer solutions.\n\nLet\u2019s brainstorm which might be the most efficient:\n\n- **Listing Integer Pairs**: This could get cumbersome, especially without a systematic approach.\n  \n- **Using Pythagorean Triples Knowledge**: If I remember any Pythagorean triples that include 39, this could be quick.\n  \n- **Algebraic Rearrangement**: Maybe helpful to find a formula or relation between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n  \n- **Graphical Interpretation**: Might give a visual clue, but not the most straightforward for integer solutions.\n\nGiven these options, I think starting with **Using Pythagorean Triples Knowledge** makes the most sense. It\u2019s quick and leverages known patterns. If that doesn't work, then I'll consider the other methods.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Recall Pythagorean Triples Knowledge**\n\nPythagorean triples are sets of three positive integers \\( (a, b, c) \\) that satisfy the equation \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\). Common ones include:\n\n- \\( (3, 4, 5) \\)\n- \\( (5, 12, 13) \\)\n- \\( (7, 24, 25) \\)\n- \\( (8, 15, 17) \\)\n- \\( (9, 40, 41) \\)\n  \nBut I don\u2019t see 39 directly in any of these. Hmm, maybe 39 is part of a larger multiple.\n\nWait, let me recall that Pythagorean triples can be generated using:\n\n\\[\nm^2 - n^2, \\quad 2mn, \\quad m^2 + n^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are positive integers with \\(m > n\\).\n\nThinking this way, let's see if 39 can be expressed as \\(m^2 + n^2\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Express 39 as \\(m^2 + n^2\\)**\n\nI need to find \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that:\n\n\\[\nm^2 + n^2 = 39\n\\]\n\nLet's list out squares of integers less than 39:\n\n- \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n- \\(4^2 = 16\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n\nBut wait, since \\(m > n\\), and both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are less than or equal to 39, let\u2019s see possible combinations:\n\n*Looking for combinations where the sum is 39:*\n\n- \\(6^2 + 3^2 = 36 + 9 = 45\\) (Too big)\n- \\(5^2 + 4^2 = 25 + 16 = 41\\) (Too big)\n- \\(5^2 + 2^2 = 25 + 4 = 29\\) (Too small)\n- \\(4^2 + 3^2 = 16 + 9 = 25\\) (Too small)\n  \nHmm, none of these work. Maybe 39 doesn\u2019t fit into a simple Pythagorean triple pattern.\n\nThis approach doesn\u2019t seem to lead anywhere. I\u2019m realizing that 39 might be the hypotenuse in a triple where the legs are not as straightforward.\n\n*Reflection:* So, using known Pythagorean triples isn\u2019t helping directly here. I need to explore another strategy.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: List Integer Pairs \\( (a, b) \\) Satisfying \\( a^2 + b^2 = 1521 \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s return to the **Listing Integer Pairs** idea. I\u2019ll look for integer solutions where:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = 1521\n\\]\n\nSince the triangle is a right triangle, and I'm asked for the length of the shorter leg, I can assume \\(a < b\\). \n\nThis might take some time, but let's see how it goes.\n\nThinking about it, perhaps I can find \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 \\leq 1521\\) and then calculate \\(b\\) as:\n\n\\[\nb = \\sqrt{1521 - a^2}\n\\]\n\nAnd check if \\(b\\) is an integer.\n\n*To proceed, I\u2019ll start with \\(a = 1\\) and go up to \\(a = 39\\) (since the hypotenuse is 39).*\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Possible \\(a\\) and Corresponding \\(b\\)**\n\nStarting from \\(a = 1\\):\n\n1. **For \\(a = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 1521 - 1^2 = 1520 \\implies b = \\sqrt{1520} \\approx 39.0 \\quad (\\text{Not an integer})\n   \\]\n   \n2. **For \\(a = 2\\):**\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 1521 - 2^2 = 1517 \\implies b = \\sqrt{1517} \\approx 38.9 \\quad (\\text{Not an integer})\n   \\]\n   \n3. **For \\(a = 3\\):**\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 1521 - 3^2 = 1516 \\implies b = \\sqrt{1516} \\approx 38.9 \\quad (\\text{Not an integer})\n   \\]\n   \n4. **For \\(a = 4\\):**\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 1521 - 4^2 = 1505 \\implies b = \\sqrt{1505} \\approx 38.8 \\quad (\\text{Not an integer})\n   \\]\n   \n*Hmm, so far, none of these yield integer \\(b\\) values. This suggests that perhaps there's a deeper pattern or that not all legs correspond to simple integers.*\n\n*Maybe there\u2019s another way to narrow it down.*\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Reconsidering the Approach**\n\nAt this point, calculating each \\(a\\) individually is becoming tedious, and it's not yielding integer \\(b\\) values. I need a more systematic approach.\n\nPerhaps I can **factorize 1521** and see if there's a pattern there.\n\nThinking back to how Pythagorean triples work, maybe I can find integer solutions by leveraging the properties of squares.\n\nLet\u2019s see if there's a relationship or a formula that can help here.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Factorizing 1521**\n\nFirst, let's see if 1521 can be factored into components related to Pythagorean triples.\n\n\\[\n1521 = 39^2\n\\]\n\nBut more interestingly, let's see if there's a relation with **Gaussian integers**, where a number can be expressed as a sum of two squares if all primes of the form \\(4k + 3\\) have even exponents in its prime factorization.\n\nBut wait, perhaps that's overcomplicating things for now.\n\nLet's try another angle.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Leveraging the Fact that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are Integers**\n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, and \\(a^2 + b^2 = 1521\\), both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) must be perfect squares.\n\nThinking practically, perhaps I can list all perfect squares up to 1521 and see which pairs add up to 1521.\n\nLet\u2019s do this:\n\n- Perfect squares up to 1521: \\(0^2, 1^2, 2^2, \\dots, 39^2\\)\n  \nBut since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both less than 39 (because \\(a^2 + b^2 = 1521\\)), I can list perfect squares up to \\(38^2 = 1444\\).\n\n*Wait a moment\u2014if both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are less than or equal to 39, and \\(a \\neq b\\), perhaps I should only consider combinations where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are distinct.*\n\nThis might help reduce the number of combinations.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with this idea.\n\n---\n\n**Step 8: Listing Distinct Perfect Square Pairs**\n\nI\u2019ll look for pairs \\( (a^2, b^2) \\) such that:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = 1521 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a \\neq b\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s start from the largest possible \\(a\\) and move downwards:\n\n1. **\\(a = 39\\):**\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 1521 - 39^2 = 0 \\implies b = 0 \\quad (\\text{Not valid since legs are positive})\n   \\]\n   \n2. **\\(a = 38\\):**\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 1521 - 38^2 = 1521 - 1444 = 77 \\implies b = \\sqrt{77} \\approx 8.8 \\quad (\\text{Not an integer})\n   \\]\n   \n3. **\\(a = 37\\):**\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 1521 - 37^2 = 1521 - 1369 = 152 \\implies b = \\sqrt{152} \\approx 12.3 \\quad (\\text{Not an integer})\n   \\]\n   \n4. **\\(a = 36\\):**\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 1521 - 36^2 = 1521 - 1296 = 225 \\implies b = 15 \\quad (\\text{Integer})\n   \\]\n   \n   *Wait, this looks promising. \\(a = 36\\) and \\(b = 15\\).*\n\n   But let\u2019s check if \\(36^2 + 15^2 = 39^2\\):\n   \n   \\[\n   36^2 + 15^2 = 1296 + 225 = 1521 = 39^2\n   \\]\n   \n   Yes, it checks out!\n\n*Reflection:* So, \\(a = 36\\) and \\(b = 15\\) form a valid Pythagorean triple with 39 as the hypotenuse. Since the question asks for the length of the shorter leg, the shorter leg is **15 units**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 9: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s double-check:\n\n- **Pythagorean Theorem Check:**\n  \n  \\[\n  36^2 + 15^2 = 1296 + 225 = 1521 = 39^2\n  \\]\n  \n  This confirms that \\(36\\), \\(15\\), and \\(39\\) form a Pythagorean triple.\n\n- **Integer Lengths:**\n  \n  All sides are integers, and the lengths make sense for a right triangle.\n\n*Conclusion:* Everything checks out. The length of the shorter leg is **15 units**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nInitially, recalling Pythagorean triples didn't work directly. However, by systematically listing possible integer pairs and verifying them against the Pythagorean theorem, I found that \\(a = 36\\) and \\(b = 15\\) are the correct lengths, with 15 being the shorter leg.\n\nIt\u2019s a good reminder that when one approach doesn\u2019t yield results, it\u2019s essential to reflect and switch strategies. In this case, leveraging systematic calculation and verification led to the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe length of the shorter leg is **15 units**.",
