Maybe this could help?\n  \n- **Odd vs. Even:** I remember that differences of squares often involve odd and even numbers. Perhaps only certain types of integers can be expressed this way?\n  \n- **Checking Simple Cases:** It might be useful to check small numbers to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n- **Exhaustive Listing:** Another approach could be to list all possible differences within a small range to spot a pattern, but that might get tedious for 1 to 1000.\n\n**At this point, I'm leaning towards exploring the difference of squares formula and perhaps checking if there's a pattern related to odd and even numbers.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Difference of Squares Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start with the formula:  \n\\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\]  \nThis means that the difference of squares can be expressed as the product of two factors: \\( (a - b) \\) and \\( (a + b) \\).\n\n**Work:**\n\n- **Let \\( n = a^2 - b^2 \\):** So, \\( n = (a - b)(a + b) \\).\n  \n- **Assign Variables:** Let \\( x = a - b \\) and \\( y = a + b \\), so \\( n = xy \\).\n  \n- **Constraints:** Both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must have the same parity (both odd or both even) because \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers. This means \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must either both be odd or both be even.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, so if \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are both odd or both even, their product \\( n = xy \\) will always be odd or even respectively. This seems important because it suggests that \\( n \\) must have certain characteristics based on its parity.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Odd \\( n \\):** \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) both odd \u2192 \\( xy \\) is odd.\n- **Even \\( n \\):** \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) both even \u2192 \\( xy \\) is even.\n\nThis checks out because the product of two odd numbers is odd, and the product of two even numbers is even.\n\n**Possible Insight:**\n\nMaybe only numbers that are odd or multiples of 4 can be expressed as the difference of squares? Let's explore this further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Testing with Small Numbers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo see if this parity idea holds, let's test some small integers to see if they can be expressed as the difference of squares.\n\n**Work:**\n\n- **n = 1:**\n  - \\( 1 = 1^2 - 0^2 \\) \u2192 \\( 1 = 1(1) \\) \u2192 Odd.\n  \n- **n = 2:**\n  - **Wait:** I can't express 2 as \\( (a - b)(a + b) \\) with both factors having the same parity.\n  \n- **n = 3:**\n  - \\( 3 = 2^2 - 1^2 \\) \u2192 \\( 3 = 3(1) \\) \u2192 Odd.\n  \n- **n = 4:**\n  - \\( 4 = 2^2 - 0^2 \\) \u2192 \\( 4 = 2(2) \\) \u2192 Even.\n  \n- **n = 5:**\n  - \\( 5 = 3^2 - 2^2 \\) \u2192 \\( 5 = 5(1) \\) \u2192 Odd.\n  \n- **n = 6:**\n  - **Reflection:** Again, I can't find integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( a^2 - b^2 = 6 \\) with \\( a - b \\) and \\( a + b \\) having the same parity.\n  \n**Insights:**\n\nFrom these tests, it seems like:\n\n- Odd numbers like 1, 3, 5 can be expressed.\n- Even numbers like 2, 6 don't fit unless they're multiples of 4 (as we'll see later).\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis supports the idea that only numbers with certain parities can be expressed as the difference of squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Focusing on Multiples of 4**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince even numbers like 2 and 6 couldn't be expressed, but 4 could, maybe only multiples of 4 can be expressed as the difference of squares alongside odd numbers.\n\n**Work:**\n\n- **Even \\( n \\) That Are Multiples of 4:**\n  - Let's see if \\( n \\) that are multiples of 4 can be expressed.\n  \n- **Formula Recap:**\n  - \\( n = (a - b)(a + b) \\)\n  - Both factors must be even if \\( n \\) is multiple of 4.\n  \n- **Example:**\n  - \\( n = 4 \\):\n    - \\( 4 = 2^2 - 0^2 \\) \u2192 \\( 4 = 2(2) \\).\n    \n- **General Case:**\n  - Suppose \\( n = 4k \\):\n    - \\( n = (a - b)(a + b) \\)\n    - Let both \\( x = a - b \\) and \\( y = a + b \\) be even.\n    - Then \\( n = xy = 4m \\), where \\( m \\) is an integer.\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems to work. If \\( n \\) is a multiple of 4, it can be expressed as the difference of squares.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Multiple of 4 \\( n \\):** \\( n = 4k \\)\n  - \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) both even \u2192 \\( xy = 4(m) \\) \u2192 Expressible.\n  \n- **Non-Multiple of 4 Even \\( n \\):** \\( n = 2k \\), but \\( k \\) is odd\n  - Can't find both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) even \u2192 Not expressible.\n  \nThis confirms that only multiples of 4 among the even numbers can be expressed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion So Far**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Odd Numbers:** Can be expressed as the difference of squares.\n- **Even Numbers:** Only multiples of 4 can be expressed.\n\n**Total So Far:**\n\n- **Odd Numbers Between 1 and 1000:**\n  - There are 500 odd numbers from 1 to 999 (1, 3, 5, ..., 999).\n\n- **Multiples of 4 Between 1 and 1000:**\n  - \\( 4, 8, 12, \\ldots, 1000 \\)\n  - There are 250 multiples of 4 from 4 to 1000.\n\n**Add Them Up:**\n\n- Total expressible numbers = 500 (odd) + 250 (multiple of 4) = **750**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Let's double-check.\n\n- **Odd Numbers:** Confirmed can all be expressed.\n- **Multiples of 4:** Confirmed can all be expressed.\n\nSeemingly, the logic holds. However, I should verify that no multiple of 4 or odd number is missed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to ensure that every odd number and every multiple of 4 is indeed covered without overlaps or omissions.\n\n**Work:**\n\n- **Odd Numbers:**\n  - All odd numbers \\( n = 2m + 1 \\) can be expressed because:\n    - \\( n = (m + 1)^2 - m^2 \\)\n    - Example: \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 1 = 1^2 - 0^2 \\); \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 3 = 2^2 - 1^2 \\), etc.\n  \n- **Multiples of 4:**\n  - All multiples of 4 \\( n = 4k \\) can be expressed as shown earlier.\n  \n- **Even Numbers Not Multiple of 4:**\n  - \\( n = 2k \\) where \\( k \\) is odd cannot be expressed because:\n    - If \\( n \\) is even but not multiple of 4, \\( n/2 \\) is odd.\n    - Need \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to be even \u2192 Impossible.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Odd Numbers:** All covered.\n- **Multiples of 4:** All covered.\n- **Even Non-Multiples of 4:** Correctly identified as non-expressible.\n\nEverything checks out. The approach seems solid.\n\n**Possible Insight:**\n\nPerhaps the total number of expressible integers is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the total integers between 1 and 1000. Let's explore this idea.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Considering Total Integers and Proportion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf 750 numbers can be expressed out of 1000, maybe there's a proportional relationship.\n\n**Work:**\n\n- **Total Integers:** 1000\n- **Expressible Integers:** 750\n\n**Proportion:**\n\n\\[ \\frac{750}{1000} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that's interesting. Does this proportion hold consistently for different ranges? Let's test with a smaller range, like 1 to 100.\n\n**Testing with Smaller Range:**\n\n- **Odd Numbers Between 1 and 100:**\n  - There are 50 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 99).\n  \n- **Multiples of 4 Between 1 and 100:**\n  - There are 25 multiples of 4 (4, 8, 12, ..., 100).\n  \n- **Total Expressible:** 50 (odd) + 25 (multiple of 4) = 75\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[ \\frac{75}{100} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\n**Insight:**\n\nThe pattern holds. It suggests that **three-fourths** of the integers in any range can be expressed as the difference of squares.\n\n**Final Calculation for 1 to 1000:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 1000 = 750\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis proportionality is a nice confirmation of our earlier work. It adds confidence that the answer is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **Odd Numbers Between 1 and 1000:** 500\n- **Multiples of 4 Between 1 and 1000:** 250\n- **Total Expressible Integers:** 500 + 250 = **750**\n\nThus, **750** of the integers between 1 and 1000 can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Odd Numbers:** All can be expressed \u2192 500.\n- **Multiples of 4:** All can be expressed \u2192 250.\n- **Non-Multiples of 4 Even Numbers:** None can be expressed \u2192 Correctly excluded.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\n\nDoes the proportionality always hold? Testing with different ranges suggests it does. However, it's always good to be cautious and perhaps look for a formal proof to solidify the claim.\n\nBut for practical purposes and based on the patterns observed, the answer is **750**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**750**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nApproaching the problem step by step allowed me to identify patterns related to odd and even numbers and verify the correctness through multiple strategies, including testing with small numbers and considering proportionality. It\u2019s always beneficial to reflect and check along the way to ensure the approach is on the right track, adjusting as needed.\n\n---\n\nBy writing out the thought process, reflections, and checks, I ensured a comprehensive and human-like approach to solving the problem, capturing the natural flow of brainstorming, exploring different strategies, and validating the solution.\n\nHope this helps!

All multiples of $4$ can be obtained by using $(b+1)^2-(b-1)^2 = 4b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. Numbers congruent to $2 \\pmod 4$ cannot be obtained because squares are $0, 1 \\pmod 4.$ Thus, the answer is $500+250 = \\boxed{750}.$"
