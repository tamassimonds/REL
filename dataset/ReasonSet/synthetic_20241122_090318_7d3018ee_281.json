  "problem": "Is it possible for a negative number to have a square root?",
  "solution": "Alright, let\u2019s tackle this question naturally. I'll brainstorm, reflect, and adjust my approach as needed. Here we go.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see the question, \u201cIs it possible for a negative number to have a square root?\u201d, my initial reaction is to think about what I know regarding square roots. I remember that squaring a number (positive or negative) results in a positive number. But does that mean negative numbers can't have square roots? Hmm, this reminds me of imaginary numbers, but I'm not entirely sure yet.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Recall Basic Concepts:**\n   - **Square of Numbers:** Think about squaring both positive and negative numbers.\n   - **Square Roots in Real Numbers:** Consider how square roots are defined in the real number system.\n\n2. **Explore Imaginary Numbers:**\n   - **Introduction to Complex Numbers:** Maybe negative numbers have square roots in a broader number system.\n\n3. **Graphical Interpretation:**\n   - **Visualizing on a Number Line:** Perhaps plotting can help me see if square roots of negative numbers exist.\n\n4. **Checking with Examples:**\n   - **Simple Calculations:** Try calculating the square root of a negative number using a calculator.\n\nI\u2019ll start by recalling basic concepts and see where that leads. If it doesn't clarify, I'll move on to exploring imaginary numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Recalling Basic Concepts**\n\n**Square of Positive and Negative Numbers:**\n- \\( (+2)^2 = 4 \\)\n- \\( (-2)^2 = 4 \\) \n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so squaring both positive and negative numbers yields a positive result. This confirms that in the real number system, squaring any real number gives a non-negative outcome.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nWait, if squaring always gives a positive result, then from a real number perspective, how would we get a negative number by squaring something? Maybe that\u2019s why I initially thought negative numbers don\u2019t have real square roots.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this mean negative numbers can't have square roots in the real number system? It seems so, but I need to explore further to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering Square Roots in the Real Number System**\n\n**Definition:**  \nThe square root of a number \\( x \\) is a number \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = x \\).\n\n**Applying to Negative Numbers:**  \nIf \\( y^2 = -4 \\), is there a real number \\( y \\) that satisfies this?\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, based on the previous step, squaring any real number yields a positive result. So, it seems impossible for \\( y^2 \\) to equal a negative number in the real number system.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThis suggests that negative numbers don\u2019t have square roots within the real numbers. But I vaguely remember something about imaginary numbers from my math classes. Perhaps I need to explore that next.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIs my current understanding correct? In the real number system, negative numbers don\u2019t have square roots. But does that mean they don\u2019t have square roots at all? I think I need to delve into complex numbers to answer this fully.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Imaginary Numbers**\n\n**Introduction to Complex Numbers:**  \nI remember learning that complex numbers extend the real numbers by including the square roots of negative numbers.\n\n**Imaginary Unit \\( i \\):**  \nDefined as \\( i = \\sqrt{-1} \\).\n\n**Applying to Negative Numbers:**  \nSo, the square root of \\( -4 \\) would be \\( 2i \\) because:\n\\[ (2i)^2 = 4 \\times (-1) = -4 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense! By introducing the imaginary unit \\( i \\), we can define square roots for negative numbers.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nOh! This reminds me of how complex numbers are used in various fields like engineering and physics to handle calculations involving square roots of negative numbers.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet\u2019s verify:\n\\[ (2i)^2 = 4 \\times (-1) = -4 \\]\nYep, that checks out. So, negative numbers do have square roots in the complex number system.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Graphical Interpretation**\n\n**Visualizing on a Number Line:**  \nIn the real number line, negative numbers don\u2019t have square roots. But if we consider the complex plane, we can represent these square roots.\n\n**Complex Plane:**  \nIt\u2019s like extending the number line into two dimensions, where the horizontal axis represents real numbers and the vertical axis represents imaginary numbers.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy visualizing it this way, I can see how square roots of negative numbers exist outside the traditional real number line.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThis graphical approach helps solidify my understanding. It\u2019s not that negative numbers lack square roots; it\u2019s just that their square roots exist in a different number system.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this align with what I\u2019ve learned so far? Yes, it reinforces the idea that negative numbers have square roots in the complex plane.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Checking with Examples**\n\n**Calculator Attempt:**  \nLet me try calculating \\( \\sqrt{-9} \\) on a basic calculator.\n\n**Outcome:**  \nMost basic calculators will return an error because they\u2019re limited to real numbers.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense because, in the real number system, \\( \\sqrt{-9} \\) doesn\u2019t exist. However, a scientific calculator that supports complex numbers would return \\( 3i \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThis practical check confirms that square roots of negative numbers require a complex number system.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this example support my previous findings? Absolutely. It shows that negative numbers have square roots in the complex number system but not in the real number system.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014recalling basic concepts, considering imaginary numbers, visualizing graphically, and checking with examples\u2014I\u2019ve concluded that:\n\n- **In the Real Number System:** Negative numbers do not have square roots because squaring any real number yields a non-negative result.\n- **In the Complex Number System:** Negative numbers do have square roots, which are represented as imaginary numbers using the imaginary unit \\( i \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nInitially, I was uncertain about whether negative numbers could have square roots. By brainstorming and exploring various approaches, I\u2019ve clarified that while negative numbers don\u2019t have square roots in the real number system, they do in the complex number system.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this conclusion align with mathematical principles? Yes, it does. Introducing the imaginary unit \\( i \\) allows us to extend the concept of square roots to negative numbers within the complex number system.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution</ANSWER>**\n\nNegative numbers **do not** have square roots in the **real number system**. However, they **do** have square roots in the **complex number system**, represented as imaginary numbers. For example, the square root of \\(-1\\) is the imaginary unit \\(i\\), where \\(i = \\sqrt{-1}\\). Similarly, the square root of any negative number can be expressed using \\(i\\).\n\nTherefore, **it is possible** for a negative number to have a square root, but only within the context of complex numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy approaching the problem step by step, reflecting at each stage, and being open to adjusting my strategies, I\u2019ve arrived at a comprehensive understanding of square roots for negative numbers. This process highlights the importance of exploring multiple angles and being willing to rethink initial assumptions to arrive at a correct and complete solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Putting It All Together**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nMy first instinct was to recall that squaring any number results in a positive outcome, which made me question the existence of square roots for negative numbers.\n\n**Exploring Basic Concepts:**  \nBy examining the squares of both positive and negative numbers, I confirmed that negative numbers don\u2019t have square roots in the real number system.\n\n**Introducing Complex Numbers:**  \nRemembering complex numbers and the imaginary unit \\( i \\), I realized that negative numbers do have square roots within the complex number system.\n\n**Graphical Interpretation:**  \nVisualizing the concept on the complex plane helped reinforce the idea that square roots of negative numbers exist outside the traditional real number line.\n\n**Practical Example:**  \nAttempting to calculate the square root of a negative number on a basic calculator demonstrated the need for complex numbers to handle such cases.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThrough this step-by-step exploration, I concluded that negative numbers have square roots in the complex number system, represented as imaginary numbers.\n\nBy reflecting and adjusting my approach throughout the process, I arrived at a complete and accurate solution, confirming that negative numbers have square roots within the context of complex numbers.",
