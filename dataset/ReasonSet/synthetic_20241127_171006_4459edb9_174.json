  "problem": "John surveyed a group of people about their knowledge of rats. To the nearest tenth of a percent, he found that $86.8\\%$ of the people surveyed thought rats carried diseases. Of the people who thought rats carried diseases, $45.7\\%$ said that rats frequently carried rabies. Since rats do not frequently carry rabies, these 21 people were mistaken. How many total people did John survey?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem naturally, just like how we would if we were thinking it through for the first time. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's see what we've got here:\n\n- **John surveyed people about their knowledge of rats.**\n- **86.8% thought rats carried diseases.**\n- **Of those, 45.7% believed rats frequently carried rabies.**\n- **These 21 people were mistaken about rabies.**\n- **We need to find out how many total people were surveyed.**\n\nInitially, I'm thinking this is a typical percentage problem where we need to work backward from the given percentages to find the total number of people surveyed. But wait\u2014I'm not entirely sure how the 21 people fit into the percentages. Do they represent a specific part of the surveyed group? Hmm... Let's brainstorm some strategies.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Proportions to Find the Total:**\n   - Maybe I can set up a proportion where the 21 people represent a certain percentage, and from there, calculate the total number of people surveyed.\n\n2. **Work Backward from Percentages:**\n   - Perhaps starting from the 21 people who were mistaken and figuring out what percentage they represent can lead me to the total.\n\n3. **Set Up an Equation:**\n   - Creating an equation that incorporates all the given percentages and the known quantity (21 people) might be a solid approach.\n\nHonestly, the first strategy seems straightforward, but I'm leaning towards the second one\u2014working backward from the 21 people\u2014because it directly ties the known quantity to the percentages given. Let's start there and see if it works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Working Backward from the 21 People**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Given:** 21 people believed rats frequently carried rabies and were mistaken.\n- **These 21 people are part of the group that thought rats carried diseases (86.8% of the total).**\n- **Within that group, 45.7% believed in the rabies misinformation.**\n\nSo, if 45.7% of those who thought rats carried diseases equals 21 people, I can set up a proportion to find out how many people thought rats carried diseases in total.\n\n**Setting Up the Proportion:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Let } x \\text{ be the number of people who thought rats carried diseases.}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n45.7\\% \\text{ of } x = 21\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.457 \\times x = 21\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{21}{0.457} \\approx 45.9536\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute... Can we have a fraction of a person? That doesn't make sense in this context. But since the percentage is rounded to the nearest tenth, it's possible that the actual number isn't an integer. Still, for practical purposes, people are whole numbers, so let's round it.\n\n\\[\nx \\approx 46 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nHmm, rounding to 46 feels a bit off because percentages generally should align neatly with whole numbers in survey data. But considering the percentages were given to the nearest tenth, slight discrepancies are possible. Let's proceed and see if it makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Total Number of People Surveyed**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that we know approximately 46 people thought rats carried diseases, which represents 86.8% of the total surveyed.\n- We can set up another proportion to find the total number of people surveyed.\n\n**Setting Up the Proportion:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Let } N \\text{ be the total number of people surveyed.}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n86.8\\% \\text{ of } N = 46\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.868 \\times N = 46\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( N \\):**\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{46}{0.868} \\approx 52.991\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN \\approx 53 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the 21 people being exactly 45.7% of those who thought rats carried diseases. Let me double-check my approach.\n\n- If \\( N \\approx 53 \\), then 86.8% of 53 should be approximately 46, which matches our earlier calculation.\n- But if 45.7% of those 46 people equals 21, the numbers should align perfectly.\n\nLet's verify:\n\n\\[\n0.457 \\times 46 \\approx 21.022\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\approx 21 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nOkay, it seems to check out. But remember, we've rounded during our calculations, which might introduce slight discrepancies. Given the precision of the percentages provided, this minor rounding is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Cross-Verification**\n\nJust to be sure, let's try a different approach to confirm our answer.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Suppose the total number of people surveyed is \\( N \\).\n- 86.8% of \\( N \\) thought rats carried diseases: \\( 0.868 \\times N \\).\n- Out of these, 45.7% thought rats frequently carried rabies: \\( 0.457 \\times (0.868 \\times N) \\).\n- This should equal the 21 people who were mistaken.\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n0.457 \\times 0.868 \\times N = 21\n\\]\n\n**Calculating:**\n\n\\[\n0.396596 \\times N = 21\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{21}{0.396596} \\approx 52.949\n\\]\n\n\\[\nN \\approx 53 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth methods\u2014working backward from the 21 people and setting up a direct equation\u2014lead us to approximately 53 people surveyed. This consistency reinforces the correctness of our solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Consistency**\n\nLet's perform a final check to ensure everything aligns.\n\n- **Total surveyed:** \\( N \\approx 53 \\)\n- **86.8% of 53 thought rats carried diseases:**\n\n\\[\n0.868 \\times 53 \\approx 46.004 \\approx 46 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\n- **45.7% of those 46 thought rats frequently carried rabies:**\n\n\\[\n0.457 \\times 46 \\approx 21.022 \\approx 21 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies and verifying each step, we conclude that John surveyed approximately **53 people**.\n\n<ANSWER>53 people</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through different approaches, reflecting at each stage, and continuously checking our work, we've arrived confidently at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "The problem tells us that $45.7 \\% $ of the people who think rats carry diseases equates to $21$ people total. If the total number of people who think that rats carry diseases is $x$, then we solve for $x$ as follows: $0.457x = 21$, so $x = 45.95$. However, we know that $x$ must be an integer, so rounding up, we get $x=46.$ Now, these $46$ people represent $86.8 \\%$ of the total number of people surveyed. So, if we let $y$ be the total number of people surveyed, we can solve for $y$ as follows: $0.868y = 46$, so $y = 52.995$. Rounding up, we get that John surveyed $\\boxed{53}$ total people."
