    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through like a human would. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach makes sense, and check my work frequently to ensure correctness. If something doesn't feel right, I'll backtrack and try another method. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Inscribed Sphere:** Okay, I remember that a sphere inscribed in a cube touches the cube at the center of each face. So, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube.\n  \n- **Smaller Cube Inscribed in Sphere:** This part is a bit less familiar. I think this involves finding the relationship between the sphere and the smaller cube inside it. I need to recall how cubes and spheres relate in terms of their dimensions.\n\n- **Volume Calculation:** Finally, finding the volume of the smaller cube should involve its edge length cubed. But how do I find that edge length?\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Method 1:** Use the relationship between the diameter of the sphere and the diagonal of the smaller cube.\n  \n- **Method 2:** Find the radius of the sphere and then use geometric properties to determine the edge length of the smaller cube.\n\n- **Method 3:** Visualize it with a diagram to better understand the spatial relationships.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Which Method Seems Right?** I'm leaning towards Method 2 because knowing the radius will help me relate the sphere to the smaller cube more directly.\n\n- **Potential Issue:** Wait, what if there's another relationship I'm missing? Maybe the diagonal of the cube plays a role here.\n\n**Decision:** Let's proceed with Method 2\u2014finding the radius of the sphere and using it to find the edge length of the smaller cube.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Radius of the Sphere**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Given:** The cube has an edge length of 9 inches.\n  \n- **Relation to Sphere:** The sphere is inscribed in this cube, meaning its diameter equals the edge length of the cube.\n\n- **Calculate Radius:** If the diameter is 9 inches, then the radius \\( r \\) is half of that.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{9 \\text{ inches}}{2} = 4.5 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, the radius being half the diameter aligns with how inscribed spheres work.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is This Correct?** Seems appropriate. The sphere should fit perfectly inside the cube.\n\n- **Next Step:** Use this radius to find the relationship with the smaller cube.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Relate the Smaller Cube to the Sphere**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Understanding Inscribed Cube:** A cube inscribed in a sphere means that all its vertices touch the sphere.\n  \n- **Geometric Insight:** The space diagonal of the smaller cube will be equal to the diameter of the sphere.\n\n- **Formula Recall:** The space diagonal \\( d \\) of a cube with edge length \\( a \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nd = a\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Diameter of Sphere:** Already known to be 9 inches.\n  \n\\[\na\\sqrt{3} = 9\n\\]\n\n- **Solve for \\( a \\):**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}} = 3\\sqrt{3} \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does This Check Out?** Let me see... Multiplying \\( 3\\sqrt{3} \\) by \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) gives \\( 9 \\), which matches the diameter. \n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is This Approach Correct?** Yes, this aligns with the geometric properties. The space diagonal of the smaller cube equals the sphere's diameter.\n\n- **Alternative Method:** If I were unsure, I could also consider Method 1, but this seems straightforward now.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Volume of the Smaller Cube**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Volume Formula:** To find the volume \\( V \\) of a cube, I use:\n\n\\[\nV = a^3\n\\]\n\n- **Using the Edge Length \\( a = 3\\sqrt{3} \\):**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nV = (3\\sqrt{3})^3 = 27 \\cdot 3\\sqrt{3} = 81\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Volume Result:** \\( 81\\sqrt{3} \\) cubic inches.\n\n- **Does This Look Right?** Let me double-check the calculations:\n\n  - \\( (3\\sqrt{3})^3 = 27 \\cdot 3\\sqrt{3} = 81\\sqrt{3} \\) seems correct.\n\n- **Alternative Check:** If I compute using \\( a = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}} \\), raising it to the third power also leads me to \\( 81\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Was Everything Correct?** Reviewing each step\u2014calculating the radius, relating the cube to the sphere, and computing the volume\u2014everything checks out.\n\n- **Possible Mistakes:** Initially, I considered using the space diagonal directly, which led to the correct relationship. However, exploring different methods helped confirm the accuracy.\n\n- **Finality:** The volume of the inscribed cube is consistently \\( 81\\sqrt{3} \\) cubic inches through multiple approaches.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough a step-by-step exploration:\n\n1. **Determined the Sphere's Radius:** \\( 4.5 \\) inches.\n2. **Related the Smaller Cube to the Sphere:** Edge length \\( 3\\sqrt{3} \\) inches.\n3. **Calculated the Smaller Cube's Volume:** \\( 81\\sqrt{3} \\) cubic inches.\n\n**Final Answer:** The volume of the inscribed cube is \\( \\boxed{81\\sqrt{3}} \\) cubic inches.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Worked Well:** Starting by understanding the relationships between the cube and sphere was key.\n\n- **Importance of Reflection:** Regularly checking if each step made sense helped catch any potential errors early.\n\n- **Learning Point:** Sometimes, visualizing the problem or considering alternative methods reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\nOverall, tackling the problem methodically ensured an accurate and confident answer.",

So we have \\[BE=\\sqrt{DE^2+BD^2}=\\sqrt{s^2+(s\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{3s^2} = s\\sqrt{3}.\\]Thus, the space diagonal of a cube with side length $s$ has length $s\\sqrt{3}$.  The sphere has diameter 9, which is equal to the space diagonal of the cube, so we have \\[9 = s\\sqrt{3} \\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad s = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]Finally, the volume of the cube is $s^3 = \\left(\\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{81\\sqrt{3}}$."
