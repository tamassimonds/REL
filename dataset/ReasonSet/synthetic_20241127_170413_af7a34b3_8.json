  "solution": "Certainly! Let's walk through this problem step by step, maintaining the original thought process while ensuring clarity and coherence. We'll explore different strategies, reflect on each step, check for correctness, and make adjustments as needed, all leading to the final answer. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's grasp what's being asked:\n\n- **License Plate Format:** Three letters followed by three digits (e.g., ABC123).\n- **Objective:** Find the probability that **at least one palindrome** exists in either the letters or the digits.\n- **Palindrome Definition:** A sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., \"ABA\" or \"121\").\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- This reminds me of probability problems where we need to account for at least one favorable event.\n- Complementary probability might be useful here\u2014calculating the probability of no palindromes and subtracting from 1.\n- I need to determine how many palindromic combinations exist for both letters and digits.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAt first glance, handling palindromes in both the letter and digit parts seems a bit complex. Breaking it down into simpler components could help.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Complementary Probability**\n\n- Calculate the probability that **no palindromes** exist in both the letters and digits, then subtract that probability from 1.\n\n**Strategy 2: Direct Calculation**\n\n- Directly calculate the probability of having at least one palindrome by considering all possible cases (e.g., palindromes in letters only, digits only, or both).\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI'll start with **Strategy 1: Complementary Probability** because it seems more straightforward. If it proves ineffective, I'll reconsider.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nComplementary probability often simplifies problems by focusing on the unfavorable cases. Let's see if it works here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Total Number of License Plates**\n\nFirst, determine the total number of possible license plates without any restrictions.\n\n- **Letters:** 26 letters in the alphabet.\n  \\[\n  26 \\times 26 \\times 26 = 26^3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Digits:** 10 digits (0-9).\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 10^3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Total Plates:**\n  \\[\n  26^3 \\times 10^3\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n26^3 = 26 \\times 26 = 676 \\times 26 = 17,576\n\\]\n\\[\n10^3 = 1,000\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total Plates} = 17,576 \\times 1,000 = 17,576,000\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat's a large number, but it makes sense given all possible combinations of letters and digits. I've confirmed the total number of license plates correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Number of Palindromic Arrangements**\n\nNext, find how many palindromic combinations exist for both the letters and the digits.\n\n#### **A. Palindromic Letters**\n\nA three-letter palindrome is of the form \\(ABA\\), where the first and third letters are the same.\n\n- **Choices:**\n  - First letter (\\(A\\)): 26 options\n  - Second letter (\\(B\\)): 26 options\n  - Third letter (\\(A\\)): Must match the first\n  \n- **Total Palindromic Letters:**\n  \\[\n  26 \\times 26 = 676\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n26 \\text{ choices for } A \\times 26 \\text{ choices for } B = 676\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense; once the first and second letters are chosen, the third is fixed. Calculation is correct.\n\n#### **B. Palindromic Digits**\n\nSimilarly, a three-digit palindrome is of the form \\(ABA\\).\n\n- **Choices:**\n  - First digit (\\(A\\)): 10 options (0-9)\n  - Second digit (\\(B\\)): 10 options\n  - Third digit (\\(A\\)): Must match the first\n  \n- **Total Palindromic Digits:**\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 10 = 100\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n10 \\text{ choices for } A \\times 10 \\text{ choices for } B = 100\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nAgain, the calculation aligns with expectations. Each digit position is independent except for the palindrome requirement.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Probability of No Palindromes**\n\nNow, calculate the probability that **neither** the letters nor the digits form a palindrome.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Determine the number of license plates where **both** the letters and digits are **non-palindromic**.\n- Compute this probability by dividing by the total number of license plates.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nTo proceed, I need to find how many non-palindromic arrangements exist for both letters and digits. Let's calculate that next.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating Non-Palindromic Arrangements**\n\n#### **A. Non-Palindromic Letters**\n\nTotal possible three-letter combinations minus the palindromic ones:\n\n\\[\n26^3 - 676 = 17,576 - 676 = 16,900\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n17,576 - 676 = 16,900\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSubtracting the palindromic arrangements from the total gives the non-palindromic ones. This calculation checks out.\n\n#### **B. Non-Palindromic Digits**\n\nTotal possible three-digit combinations minus the palindromic ones:\n\n\\[\n10^3 - 100 = 1,000 - 100 = 900\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n1,000 - 100 = 900\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSame logic applies here as with the letters. The numbers are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating Plates with No Palindromes**\n\nCalculate the total number of license plates where both the letters and digits are non-palindromic:\n\n\\[\n16,900 \\times 900\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n16,900 \\times 900 = 16,900 \\times (1,000 - 100) = 16,900,000 - 1,690,000 = 15,210,000\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n16,900,000 - 1,690,000 = 15,210,000\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBreaking it down like this helps ensure accuracy. The multiplication is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Probability of No Palindromes**\n\nNow, find the probability that a license plate has no palindromes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{No Palindromes}) = \\frac{15,210,000}{17,576,000}\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n\nTo simplify, divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI need to find the GCD of 15,210,000 and 17,576,000 to simplify the fraction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Simplifying the Probability Fraction**\n\n**Finding GCD:**\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1. \\(17,576,000 \\div 15,210,000 = 1\\) remainder \\(2,366,000\\)\n2. \\(15,210,000 \\div 2,366,000 = 6\\) remainder \\(1,214,000\\)\n3. \\(2,366,000 \\div 1,214,000 = 1\\) remainder \\(1,152,000\\)\n4. \\(1,214,000 \\div 1,152,000 = 1\\) remainder \\(62,000\\)\n5. \\(1,152,000 \\div 62,000 = 18\\) remainder \\(36,000\\)\n6. \\(62,000 \\div 36,000 = 1\\) remainder \\(26,000\\)\n7. \\(36,000 \\div 26,000 = 1\\) remainder \\(10,000\\)\n8. \\(26,000 \\div 10,000 = 2\\) remainder \\(6,000\\)\n9. \\(10,000 \\div 6,000 = 1\\) remainder \\(4,000\\)\n10. \\(6,000 \\div 4,000 = 1\\) remainder \\(2,000\\)\n11. \\(4,000 \\div 2,000 = 2\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n\n**GCD:**\n\nThe GCD is \\(2,000\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt took several steps, but now I can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by \\(2,000\\).\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15,210,000}{17,576,000} = \\frac{15,210,000 \\div 2,000}{17,576,000 \\div 2,000} = \\frac{7,605}{8,788}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n15,210,000 \\div 2,000 = 7,605\n\\]\n\\[\n17,576,000 \\div 2,000 = 8,788\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe fraction is now simplified. Let's see if it can be reduced further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Simplifying the Fraction Further**\n\n**Checking for Additional Simplification:**\n\nI\u2019ll check if \\(7,605\\) and \\(8,788\\) have any common factors.\n\n- **Divisibility by 5:**\n  - \\(7,605 \\div 5 = 1,521\\)\n  - \\(8,788 \\div 5 = 1,757.6\\) (not an integer)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSince dividing \\(8,788\\) by 5 does not yield an integer, 5 is not a common factor. Let's try smaller primes.\n\n- **Divisibility by 3:**\n  - Sum of digits of \\(7,605\\): \\(7 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 18\\) (divisible by 3)\n  - Sum of digits of \\(8,788\\): \\(8 + 7 + 8 + 8 = 31\\) (not divisible by 3)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOnly \\(7,605\\) is divisible by 3, so 3 is not a common factor. Let's try dividing by 7.\n\n- **Divisibility by 7:**\n  - \\(7,605 \\div 7 = 1,086.428571...\\) (not an integer)\n  - \\(8,788 \\div 7 = 1,255.428571...\\) (not an integer)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNeither number is divisible by 7. It seems that \\(7,605\\) and \\(8,788\\) do not have any common factors other than 1, so the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\n**Final Simplification:**\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{7,605}{8,788}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Calculating the Probability of At Least One Palindrome**\n\nNow, compute the probability of **at least one palindrome** by subtracting the probability of no palindromes from 1:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{At Least One Palindrome}) = 1 - P(\\text{No Palindromes}) = 1 - \\frac{7,605}{8,788}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{7,605}{8,788} = \\frac{8,788}{8,788} - \\frac{7,605}{8,788} = \\frac{8,788 - 7,605}{8,788} = \\frac{1,183}{8,788}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n8,788 - 7,605 = 1,183\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe subtraction is correct. Now, let's see if \\(\\frac{1,183}{8,788}\\) can be simplified.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Simplifying the Final Probability Fraction**\n\n**Finding GCD of 1,183 and 8,788:**\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm again:\n\n1. \\(8,788 \\div 1,183 = 7\\) remainder \\(1,079\\)\n2. \\(1,183 \\div 1,079 = 1\\) remainder \\(104\\)\n3. \\(1,079 \\div 104 = 10\\) remainder \\(39\\)\n4. \\(104 \\div 39 = 2\\) remainder \\(26\\)\n5. \\(39 \\div 26 = 1\\) remainder \\(13\\)\n6. \\(26 \\div 13 = 2\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n\n**GCD:**\n\nThe GCD is \\(13\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, I can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by \\(13\\).\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1,183}{8,788} = \\frac{1,183 \\div 13}{8,788 \\div 13} = \\frac{91}{676}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n1,183 \\div 13 = 91\n\\]\n\\[\n8,788 \\div 13 = 676\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe fraction simplifies nicely to \\(\\frac{91}{676}\\). Let's see if it can be reduced further.\n\n**Further Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{91}{676} = \\frac{7 \\times 13}{2^2 \\times 13^2} = \\frac{7}{4 \\times 13} = \\frac{7}{52}\n\\]\n\n**Final Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{91}{676} = \\frac{7}{52}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n91 \\div 13 = 7\n\\]\n\\[\n676 \\div 13 = 52\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe fraction is completely simplified. The probability of at least one palindrome is \\(\\frac{7}{52}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Final Answer in Requested Format**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability in the form \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers, and then to find \\(m + n\\).\n\n**Final Probability:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{At Least One Palindrome}) = \\frac{7}{52}\n\\]\n\n**Identifying \\(m\\) and \\(n\\):**\n\n\\[\nm = 7,\\quad n = 52\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(m + n\\):**\n\n\\[\nm + n = 7 + 52 = 59\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out.
