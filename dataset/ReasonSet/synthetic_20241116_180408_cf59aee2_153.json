    "working_out": "### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at this problem, here's what comes to mind:\n\n- **Types of Shapes Involved:** We have a rectangle \\( R \\) and a square \\( S \\). Both are related by their side lengths and areas.\n  \n- **Percent Changes:** The problem mentions \"10 percent more\" and \"10 percent less.\" Percent changes usually involve multiplying by a factor (like 1.1 for an increase and 0.9 for a decrease).\n\n- **Area Ratios:** The goal is to find the ratio of the area of rectangle \\( R \\) to the area of square \\( S \\). This suggests that the relationship between their side lengths will directly impact their areas, since area is proportional to the square of the side length.\n\n- **Recalling Similar Problems:** This reminds me of problems where dimensions are scaled by percentages. I\u2019ve tackled similar ones where you need to account for both length and width changes separately.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Algebraic Approach:** Define variables for the side lengths, apply the percent changes, and then calculate the areas.\n\n2. **Proportionality Insight:** Since areas are proportional to the square of side lengths, maybe there's a shortcut using percentage changes directly on the area ratios.\n\n3. **Numerical Example:** Plug in hypothetical values for the side lengths to see if the pattern holds, which can validate the algebraic approach.\n\n**Reflection:** I think starting with an algebraic approach makes sense to establish a clear relationship, and then we can check it with a numerical example to ensure correctness.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining Variables**\n\nLet\u2019s define the side lengths:\n\n- Let \\( s \\) be the length of a side of square \\( S \\).\n  \n- For rectangle \\( R \\):\n  - **Longer Side:** Increases by 10% compared to \\( s \\).\n  - **Shorter Side:** Decreases by 10% compared to \\( s \\).\n\n**Thoughts:** Defining these variables helps set up the equations clearly. It\u2019ll make calculating the areas straightforward.\n\n**Wait a Moment:** Is it necessary to define both sides of rectangle \\( R \\)? Since area is length times width, I might only need the lengths of both sides. But for clarity, let's keep both.\n\n**Reflection:** Defining both sides seems useful to fully understand the rectangle's dimensions and verify the area calculation later.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Side Lengths of Rectangle \\( R \\)**\n\nNow, let's find the lengths of the sides of rectangle \\( R \\):\n\n1. **Longer Side (\\( L \\)):**\n   \\[\n   L = s \\times 1.1 = 1.1s\n   \\]\n   \n   *This makes sense because increasing by 10% means multiplying by 1.1.*\n\n2. **Shorter Side (\\( W \\)):**\n   \\[\n   W = s \\times 0.9 = 0.9s\n   \\]\n   \n   *Decreasing by 10% means multiplying by 0.9. This seems correct.*\n\n**Quick Check:** Multiplying by 1.1 and 0.9 aligns with the percent changes specified in the problem. This feels right.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Areas**\n\nNext, let's calculate the areas of both shapes to find the ratio.\n\n1. **Area of Square \\( S \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_S = s^2\n   \\]\n   \n   *A square's area is its side length squared. Simple.*\n\n2. **Area of Rectangle \\( R \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_R = L \\times W = (1.1s) \\times (0.9s) = 0.99s^2\n   \\]\n   \n   *Multiplying the longer and shorter sides gives the area. Let's see...*\n\n   \\[\n   1.1 \\times 0.9 = 0.99\n   \\]\n   \n   *Checking the multiplication:*\n\n   \\[\n   1.1 \\times 0.9 = 1.1 \\times (1 - 0.1) = 1.1 - 0.11 = 0.99\n   \\]\n   \n   *That checks out. So, the area of rectangle \\( R \\) is 0.99 times the area of square \\( S \\).*\n\n**Reflection:** The area of rectangle \\( R \\) is slightly less than that of square \\( S \\), which makes sense because one side is longer and the other is shorter compared to square \\( S \\).\n\n### **Step 4: Determining the Ratio of the Areas**\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of the area of rectangle \\( R \\) to the area of square \\( S \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Area}_R}{\\text{Area}_S} = \\frac{0.99s^2}{s^2} = 0.99\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Wait, the ratio is 0.99? That seems unusual because ratios are typically expressed as fractions greater than 1 for lengths. But since the question asks for the ratio of the areas, 0.99 is indeed correct, as it implies that rectangle \\( R \\)'s area is 99% of square \\( S \\)'s area.\n\n**Checking Work:** \n\n- **Calculation:** 0.99 is correct because dividing 0.99 by 1 (the area of square \\( S \\) in our ratio) gives 0.99.\n\n- **Interpretation:** A ratio of 0.99 means rectangle \\( R \\) has slightly less area than square \\( S \\), which aligns with our earlier calculations.\n\n- **Common Fraction:** The question asks for the answer as a common fraction. Since 0.99 can be expressed as \\(\\frac{99}{100}\\), we can represent the ratio as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Area}_R}{\\text{Area}_S} = \\frac{99}{100}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:** \n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, the ratio \\(\\frac{99}{100}\\) indicates that rectangle \\( R \\) has 99% of the area of square \\( S \\), which aligns with the percent changes applied to the side lengths.\n\n- **Alternative Verification:** To double-check, if we set \\( s = 100 \\), then:\n  \n  - **Square \\( S \\):** Area = \\( 100^2 = 10,000 \\)\n  - **Rectangle \\( R \\):** \n    - Longer side = \\( 110 \\)\n    - Shorter side = \\( 90 \\)\n    - Area = \\( 110 \\times 90 = 9,900 \\)\n    \n    \\[\n    \\frac{9,900}{10,000} = 0.99 = \\frac{99}{100}\n    \\]\n  \n  *This confirms our earlier calculation.*\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{99}{100}}\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully defining the side lengths of rectangle \\( R \\) based on the percent changes relative to square \\( S \\), calculating the respective areas, and determining their ratio, we arrived at the ratio of the areas as \\(\\frac{99}{100}\\). Throughout the process, checking each step ensured the validity of the approach and the correctness of the final answer.",
