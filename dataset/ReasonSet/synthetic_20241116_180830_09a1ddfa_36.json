    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process step by step, exploring different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it manually. Let's start by really understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**User Query:**\nSolve for \\( n \\):  \n\\[\n\\frac{2-n}{n+1} + \\frac{2n-4}{2-n} = 1\n\\]\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **Initial Reaction:** This equation involves fractions with expressions in the numerator and denominator. It looks similar to rational equations I've dealt with before.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Common Denominator:** Perhaps finding a common denominator to combine the fractions.\n  - **Inverse Expressions:** Notice that \\( 2 - n \\) appears in both terms; maybe something can be simplified there.\n  - **Cross Multiplication:** Multiplying both sides by the common denominator to eliminate fractions.\n  - **Substitution:** Introducing a variable substitution could simplify the equation.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- I remember that combining fractions with a common denominator might help simplify the equation.\n- Alternatively, since \\( 2 - n \\) appears in both terms, maybe I can factor or simplify using that.\n- Cross-multiplying could work, but I'm cautious\u2014it's easy to make mistakes by multiplying incorrectly.\n\n**Feeling Stuck:**\n- Wait, before diving in, I should consider simplifying first to see if there's an easier path.\n- Maybe handling one fraction at a time could make things clearer.\n\n**Decision:**\n- I'll start by seeing if simplifying the fractions individually helps. If not, I'll consider finding a common denominator or cross-multiplying.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting to Simplify Fractions Individually**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Let's look at each fraction separately to see if there's a straightforward simplification.\n\n**First Fraction:**\n\\[\n\\frac{2-n}{n+1}\n\\]\n- **Reflection:** Nothing seems immediately reducible here.\n\n**Second Fraction:**\n\\[\n\\frac{2n-4}{2-n}\n\\]\n- **Observation:** Wait, I notice that \\( 2n - 4 \\) can be factored. Specifically, \\( 2n - 4 = 2(n - 2) \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Realization:** This could be helpful. Also, \\( 2 - n \\) is the negative of \\( n - 2 \\):  \n  \\[\n  2 - n = -(n - 2)\n  \\]\n- **Substituting:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{2(n - 2)}{-(n - 2)} = -2\n  \\]\n- **Conclusion:** So,  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{2n - 4}{2 - n} = -2\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because dividing \\( 2(n - 2) \\) by \\( -(n - 2) \\) simplifies to -2.\n- **Good Spot:** This simplification worked nicely, but I need to be careful\u2014factoring and recognizing negative signs is crucial here.\n\n**Next Step:**\n- Now I can replace \\( \\frac{2n - 4}{2 - n} \\) with -2 in the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Substituting the Simplified Fraction Back into the Equation**\n\n**Equation Update:**\n\\[\n\\frac{2 - n}{n + 1} + (-2) = 1\n\\]\nor  \n\\[\n\\frac{2 - n}{n + 1} - 2 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Simplifying Further:** To isolate the fraction, I'll add 2 to both sides.  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{2 - n}{n + 1} = 1 + 2 = 3\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Is this step correct? Yes, adding 2 to both sides balances the equation.\n\n**Next Step:**\n- Now, I have  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{2 - n}{n + 1} = 3\n  \\]\n- **Goal:** Solve for \\( n \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Equation \\( \\frac{2 - n}{n + 1} = 3 \\) Using Cross Multiplication**\n\n**Approach:**\n- **Cross Multiplying:** This is a straightforward method to eliminate the fraction.\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n\\[\n2 - n = 3(n + 1)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Wait:** Let me double-check the cross multiplication:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{2 - n}{n + 1} = 3 \\implies 2 - n = 3(n + 1)\n  \\]\n- **Confirmation:** Yes, multiplying both sides by \\( n + 1 \\) should work since it's a linear equation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Worried About:** Is \\( n + 1 \\) ever zero? If \\( n = -1 \\), the original denominator becomes zero, making the equation undefined. So, I need to ensure \\( n \\neq -1 \\).\n\n**Next Step:**\n- Proceed with solving the equation:  \n  \\[\n  2 - n = 3n + 3\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving for \\( n \\)**\n\n**Equation:**\n\\[\n2 - n = 3n + 3\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Isolate \\( n \\):** Let's get all \\( n \\)-terms on one side. First, add \\( n \\) to both sides:  \n  \\[\n  2 = 4n + 3\n  \\]\n- **Next:** Subtract 3 from both sides:  \n  \\[\n  2 - 3 = 4n \\implies -1 = 4n\n  \\]\n- **Solve for \\( n \\):**  \n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{-1}{4}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Plugging \\( n = \\frac{-1}{4} \\) back into the original equation should confirm its correctness.\n  \n**Next Step:**\n- But first, let me quickly verify that \\( n = -\\frac{1}{4} \\) doesn't make any denominator zero.  \n  \\[\n  n + 1 = -\\frac{1}{4} + 1 = \\frac{3}{4} \\neq 0\n  \\]\n- **Conclusion:** No issues with the denominator, so \\( n = -\\frac{1}{4} \\) is a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verification**\n\n**Approach:**\n- **Plugging Back:** Substitute \\( n = -\\frac{1}{4} \\) into the original equation to ensure it holds true.\n\n**Substitution:**\n\\[\n\\frac{2 - (-\\frac{1}{4})}{-\\frac{1}{4} + 1} + \\frac{2(-\\frac{1}{4}) - 4}{2 - (-\\frac{1}{4})} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Numerators:**\n\\[\n\\frac{2 + \\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{3}{4}} + \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2} - 4}{\\frac{9}{4}} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{9}{4}}{\\frac{3}{4}} + \\frac{-\\frac{9}{2}}{\\frac{9}{4}} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{3} + \\frac{-\\frac{9}{2}}{\\frac{9}{4}} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n3 + (-2) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Simplified Equation:**\n\\[\n1 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\( n = -\\frac{1}{4} \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- **Validation:** The solution satisfies the original equation.\n- **Process Reflection:** Initially considering multiple strategies helped identify the most straightforward path\u2014simplifying the second fraction led directly to a solvable equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and simplifying the fractions carefully, I've determined that the solution is  \n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]  \nBy reflecting and verifying each step, I ensured the approach was correct and the final answer valid.",
