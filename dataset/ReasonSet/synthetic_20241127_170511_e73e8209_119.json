  "problem": "For a list of five positive integers, none greater than 100, the mean is 1.5 times the mode. If 31, 58, 98, $x$ and $x$ are the five integers, what is the value of $x$?",
  "solution": "### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nAlright, let's dive back into this problem. My **first impression** is that we're dealing with five positive integers where the mean is 1.5 times the mode. Notably, \\( x \\) appears twice in the list, which suggests that \\( x \\) might be the mode. But I remember from my previous attempt that things didn't quite add up, so I'll need to be more careful this time.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. Calculate the mean in terms of \\( x \\) and relate it to the mode.\n  2. Explore different values for \\( x \\) to see which satisfies the condition.\n  3. Use algebra to set up equations and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n**Honestly,** I'm still inclined to start with setting up an equation involving the mean and mode, but I'll make sure to double-check my calculations along the way. Let's begin by unpacking the components again.\n\n### **Understanding the Components**\n\n- **Given:**\n  - Five integers: 31, 58, 98, \\( x \\), \\( x \\)\n  - The mean is 1.5 times the mode\n  - \\( x \\) appears twice, implying it could be the mode\n\n- **To find:** The value of \\( x \\)\n\n**Reflection:** Since \\( x \\) appears twice and the other numbers only once, it makes sense that \\( x \\) is the mode. However, I need to ensure that my calculations align with this assumption.\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying the Mode**\n\n**Thought Process:** The mode is the number that appears most frequently. Given that \\( x \\) appears twice and no other number repeats, **\\( x \\) is definitely the mode**.\n\n**Check:** No other number appears more than once, so **\\( x \\) is the mode**.\n\n### **Step 2: Establishing the Mean**\n\n**Thought Process:** The mean is the average of all five numbers. So, I'll sum them up and divide by five.\n\n- **Sum of numbers:** \n  \\[\n  31 + 58 + 98 + x + x = 187 + 2x\n  \\]\n- **Mean:** \n  \\[\n  \\frac{187 + 2x}{5}\n  \\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{187 + 2x}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This setup still seems correct. No issues here.\n\n### **Step 3: Relating Mean to Mode**\n\n**Given Condition:** The mean is 1.5 times the mode.\n\n- **Mode is \\( x \\):** So, \n  \\[\n  \\text{Mean} = 1.5x\n  \\]\n\n**Setting up the equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{187 + 2x}{5} = 1.5x\n\\]\n\n**Check:** This equation makes sense because we're directly relating the mean to the mode.\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:** Let's solve for \\( x \\) by clearing the fraction and simplifying the equation.\n\n**Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominator:**\n\n\\[\n187 + 2x = 7.5x\n\\]\n\n**Subtracting \\( 2x \\) from both sides to isolate \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\n187 = 7.5x - 2x \\\\\n187 = 5.5x\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{187}{5.5} = \\frac{374}{11} \\approx 34\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a minute, can \\( x \\) be a decimal? Let's **double-check** that because \\( x \\) needs to be a positive integer.\n\n### **Step 5: Re-evaluating the Solution**\n\n**Check:** Since \\( x \\) represents a positive integer, and my calculation yielded approximately 34, I need to verify if this is valid.\n\n**Exact Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{374}{11} = 34\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Hmm, \\( \\frac{374}{11} \\) results in an integer value of 34. **This actually works** because 34 is a positive integer within the specified range.\n\n**Reflection:** In my previous attempt, I might have misinterpreted the result, thinking it was non-integer. **Now I see** that \\( x = 34 \\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### **Step 6: Validating the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:** To ensure correctness, let's plug \\( x = 34 \\) back into the original conditions and verify that the mean is indeed 1.5 times the mode.\n\n- **List of numbers:** 31, 58, 98, 34, 34\n- **Sum:** \n  \\[\n  31 + 58 + 98 + 34 + 34 = 255\n  \\]\n- **Mean:** \n  \\[\n  \\frac{255}{5} = 51\n  \\]\n- **Mode:** 34\n- **Check:** \n  \\[\n  1.5 \\times 34 = 51\n  \\]\n- **Comparison:** 51 vs. 51\n\n**Reflection:** The mean is exactly 1.5 times the mode, which **confirms** that \\( x = 34 \\) is the correct solution.\n\n### **Step 7: Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:** After revisiting and correctly solving the equation, I've determined that \\( x = 34 \\) satisfies all the given conditions. The initial oversight was in misinterpreting the fractional result, but upon closer examination, it aligns perfectly.\n\n<ANSWER>34</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The value of \\( x \\) is **34**, which ensures that the mean of the list is 1.5 times the mode.",
  "ground_truth": "The mean of the list 31, 58, 98, $x$ and $x$ is $(31+58+98+2x)/5=(187+2x)/5$, and the mode is $x$.  Solving $1.5x=(187+2x)/5$ we find $x=\\boxed{34}$."
