  "problem": "A math teacher requires Noelle to do one homework assignment for each of the first five homework points she wants to earn; for each of the next five homework points, she needs to do two homework assignments; and so on, so that to earn the $n^{\\text{th}}$ homework point, she has to do $n\\div5$ (rounded up) homework assignments. For example, when she has 11 points, it will take $12\\div5=2.4\\rightarrow3$ homework assignments to earn her $12^{\\text{th}}$ point. What is the smallest number of homework assignments necessary to earn a total of 25 homework points?",
  "solution": "### **Complete Solution**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, exploring them, and adjusting my approach as needed. I'll let my thoughts flow naturally, just like how I would tackle a problem in real life.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so Noelle needs to earn 25 homework points, and the number of assignments per point increases as she earns more points. This reminds me of a piecewise function or a step-up system where the effort increases after certain thresholds. Initially, it seems like I need to calculate the total number of assignments by adding up the assignments required for each point up to 25. But I\u2019m not entirely sure if that\u2019s the most efficient way\u2014maybe there\u2019s a pattern or shortcut I can exploit.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Calculate Point by Point:** Add up the assignments needed for each point up to 25.\n2. **Look for Patterns:** See if there\u2019s a repeating pattern after a certain number of points.\n3. **Use Arithmetic Series:** Maybe it's an arithmetic series where the number of assignments increases linearly.\n4. **Check for Geometric Progression:** Less likely, but worth considering if the increase is exponential.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the first strategy: calculating point by point.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Calculate Point by Point**\n\nI'll start by listing out how many assignments are needed for each homework point up to 25.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For the first 5 points, it's straightforward: 1 assignment per point.\n- From the 6th point onward, the assignments per point increase based on \\( n \\div 5 \\) rounded up.\n\nBut wait, manually calculating each point up to 25 might be time-consuming. Let me think if there\u2019s a better way\u2014perhaps identifying intervals where the number of assignments per point remains constant.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nActually, breaking it down into intervals where the number of assignments remains the same might be more efficient. This way, I can multiply the number of points within each interval by the assignments needed per point.\n\nLet\u2019s adjust the strategy to focus on intervals.\n\n---\n\n### **Adjusting Strategy: Calculate by Intervals**\n\nI'll identify the intervals where the number of assignments per point is constant and calculate the total assignments for each interval.\n\n**Intervals Identified:**\n\n1. **Points 1 to 5:** 1 assignment per point\n2. **Points 6 to 10:** 2 assignments per point\n3. **Points 11 to 15:** 3 assignments per point\n4. **Points 16 to 20:** 4 assignments per point\n5. **Points 21 to 25:** 5 assignments per point\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll calculate the total assignments needed for each interval and sum them up.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Points 1 to 5:**\n   - Assignments per point: 1\n   - Total assignments: \\( 5 \\times 1 = 5 \\)\n\n2. **Points 6 to 10:**\n   - Assignments per point: 2\n   - Total assignments: \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\)\n\n3. **Points 11 to 15:**\n   - Assignments per point: 3\n   - Total assignments: \\( 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\)\n\n4. **Points 16 to 20:**\n   - Assignments per point: 4\n   - Total assignments: \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\)\n\n5. **Points 21 to 25:**\n   - Assignments per point: 5\n   - Total assignments: \\( 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\)\n\n**Total Assignments:**\n\n\\[ 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 = 75 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if I\u2019ve accounted for all points correctly and if the rounding up was applied properly. Each interval represents five points, and the assignments per point increase by 1 after each interval, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me verify if this approach makes sense.\n\n- **First Interval (1-5):** 5 assignments for 5 points \u2192 Correct.\n- **Second Interval (6-10):** 10 assignments for 5 points \u2192 Correct.\n- **Third Interval (11-15):** 15 assignments for 5 points \u2192 Correct.\n- **Fourth Interval (16-20):** 20 assignments for 5 points \u2192 Correct.\n- **Fifth Interval (21-25):** 25 assignments for 5 points \u2192 Correct.\n\nEverything checks out. The total number of assignments required is 75.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Looking for Patterns**\n\nJust to be sure, let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can confirm this calculation.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The number of assignments per point increases linearly every five points.\n- This resembles an arithmetic sequence where the common difference is 1.\n\nMaybe I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to verify.\n\n**Formula:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = n \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{first term} + \\text{last term}}{2}\\right) \\]\n\nBut this formula works for sequences where each term is added individually. In this case, each interval has a constant number of assignments per point. So, the approach I used earlier\u2014calculating by intervals\u2014is more appropriate.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe initial strategy seems correct, and no additional patterns or shortcuts are apparent that would simplify the calculation further.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet me do a final sanity check to ensure everything adds up correctly.\n\n- **Total Points:** 25\n- **Total Assignments Calculated:** 75\n- **Average Assignments per Point:** \\( \\frac{75}{25} = 3 \\)\n\nThis average aligns with the increasing effort required as Noelle earns more points. Early points require fewer assignments, and later points require more, averaging out to 3 assignments per point.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe calculation seems consistent and logical. No discrepancies found.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy breaking down the problem into intervals where the number of assignments per point is constant, I was able to efficiently calculate the total number of assignments required. Initial thoughts led me to consider calculating each point individually, but recognizing the repeating pattern allowed for a more streamlined approach. Regular checks and reflections ensured the accuracy of the solution, confirming that Noelle needs to complete 75 assignments to earn 25 homework points.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nAlways look for patterns or repeatable sections in a problem to simplify calculations. Breaking down complex problems into manageable parts can make finding the solution more straightforward and less error-prone.\n\n**<ANSWER>**\n\nNoelle needs to complete a total of 75 homework assignments to earn 25 homework points.\n\n<ANSWER> \n\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "Noelle only has to do 1 homework assignment to earn her first point, and the same is true for each of her first five points.  She must then do 2 homework assignments to earn her sixth point, seventh point, and so on, up to her tenth point.  Continuing, we see that Noelle must do a total of \\[1+1+1+1+1+2+2+2+2+2+\\dots+5+5+5+5+5\\] homework assignments to earn 25 points.\n\nThis sum may be rewritten as $5(1+2+3+4+5)=5(15)=\\boxed{75}$."
