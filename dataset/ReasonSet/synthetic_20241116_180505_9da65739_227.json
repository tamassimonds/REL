    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through each part as if I were solving it for the first time. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, my initial reaction is:\n\n- **Understanding the Question:** The problem states that the graph of the equation \\( x + 2y + 3 = 0 \\) is perpendicular to the graph of the equation \\( ax + 2y + 3 = 0 \\). I need to find the value of \\( a \\).\n\n- **Perpendicular Lines:** From what I remember, two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is \\(-1\\). This reminds me of concepts involving linear equations and their slopes.\n\n- **Similar Problem:** This looks similar to finding slopes and using the perpendicularity condition. I've done problems like this before, where determining the relationship between slopes was key.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Find the Slope of Each Line:** Calculate the slope of both equations and set up the equation for slopes being negative reciprocals.\n  2. **Alternative Approaches:** Maybe there's another method involving converting to slope-intercept form or using the general form properties.\n  3. **Check if Both Equations Have the Same Y-Intercept:** This might help in verifying the slopes' relationship.\n\nAt this point, I feel that finding the slopes is the most straightforward approach. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Find the Slope of the First Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To determine the slope, I recall that the standard form of a linear equation is \\( Ax + By + C = 0 \\).\n- The slope \\( m \\) is given by \\( m = -\\frac{A}{B} \\).\n- For the equation \\( x + 2y + 3 = 0 \\), \\( A = 1 \\) and \\( B = 2 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nm_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** So, the slope of the first line is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\). That seems correct because flipping the numerator and denominator makes sense for finding the slope.\n- **Does It Match My Expectation?** Yes, because I expected the slope to be negative, aligning with the concept of perpendicular lines.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Express the Second Equation in Standard Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The second equation is \\( ax + 2y + 3 = 0 \\).\n- To find its slope, I need to identify the coefficients \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) just like I did for the first equation.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Equation: } ax + 2y + 3 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nA = a, \\quad B = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nm_2 = -\\frac{a}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Is this correct? Yes, I've followed the same method as with the first equation.\n- **Does It Match My Expectation?** The slope depends on \\( a \\), which makes sense since \\( a \\) is the variable we're trying to find.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Set Up the Perpendicularity Condition**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be \\(-1\\).\n- So, I need to set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nm_1 \\times m_2 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right) = -1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{4} = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Multiplying the slopes gives \\(\\frac{a}{4} = -1\\). That seems logical because the negative signs cancel out.\n- **Does It Align with My Expectation?** Yes, this aligns with the perpendicularity condition I remember.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solve for \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I need to isolate \\( a \\) in the equation \\(\\frac{a}{4} = -1\\).\n- This should give me the value of \\( a \\) that makes the lines perpendicular.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{4} = -1\n\\]\n\n\\[\na = -1 \\times 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\na = -4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** So, \\( a = -4 \\). This value makes the product of the slopes \\(-1\\), satisfying the perpendicularity condition.\n- **Does It Make Sense?** Yes, because with \\( a = -4\\), the second line's slope becomes \\(\\frac{4}{2} = 2\\), and \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = -1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- It's essential to double-check if \\( a = -4 \\) indeed satisfies the original condition of perpendicularity.\n- Let's plug \\( a = -4 \\) back into the second equation's slope and confirm the slopes' product is \\(-1\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Slope of Second Equation with \\( a = -4 \\):**\n\n\\[\nm_2 = -\\frac{-4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\n2. **Product of Slopes:**\n\n\\[\nm_1 \\times m_2 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** The product of the slopes is indeed \\(-1\\), confirming that the lines are perpendicular when \\( a = -4 \\).\n- **Does It Confirm My Calculation?** Yes, this verification aligns with the perpendicularity condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Rearranging to Slope-Intercept Form:** Perhaps converting both equations to slope-intercept form (\\( y = mx + b \\)) could provide more clarity about their slopes and intercepts.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- By rewriting both equations in \\( y = mx + b \\) form, I can directly see their slopes and y-intercepts, which might offer an alternative way to confirm \\( a = -4 \\).\n\n**Proceeding with Alternative Approach:**\n\n1. **First Equation:**\n\n\\[\nx + 2y + 3 = 0 \\implies 2y = -x - 3 \\implies y = -\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n   - **Slope:** \\( m_1 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\)\n   - **Y-Intercept:** \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\)\n\n2. **Second Equation:**\n\n\\[\nax + 2y + 3 = 0 \\implies 2y = -ax - 3 \\implies y = -\\frac{a}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n   - **Slope:** \\( m_2 = -\\frac{a}{2} \\)\n   - **Y-Intercept:** \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\)\n\n**Checking Perpendicularity Condition:**\n\n\\[\nm_1 \\times m_2 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right) = \\frac{a}{4} = -1\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\n\n\\[\na = -4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** This alternative method also leads to \\( a = -4 \\), confirming the result obtained earlier.\n- **Does It Validate My Initial Approach?** Yes, it reinforces the correctness of the slope-based approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To ensure complete certainty, let's quickly recap the main steps and their checks to verify the solution's integrity.\n\n1. **Slope of First Equation:** \\( m_1 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\)\n2. **Slope of Second Equation with \\( a = -4 \\):** \\( m_2 = 2 \\)\n3. **Product of Slopes:** \\( m_1 \\times m_2 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = -1 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** All conditions are satisfied; the product of the slopes is \\(-1\\), confirming the lines are perpendicular.\n- **Does Everything Align?** Yes, every step checks out, and the solution \\( a = -4 \\) is consistent across different approaches.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014starting with finding the slopes and verifying through an alternative method\u2014I confidently conclude that the value of \\( a \\) that makes the graphs of the given equations perpendicular is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-4}\n\\]\n\nBy brainstorming, reflecting, checking each step, and considering alternative approaches, I've ensured that the solution is thorough and correct.",
