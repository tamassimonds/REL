    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking if each approach makes sense before moving on. It'll be like brainstorming a solution, noting any dead ends, and adjusting the path as needed.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **It's a Rectangle:** Okay, so we have rectangle \\(ABCD\\) with \\(AB = 100\\). Rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles right angles.\n- **Midpoint Involvement:** \\(E\\) is the midpoint of \\(\\overline{AD}\\). Midpoints often play a role in symmetry, which might help.\n- **Perpendicular Lines:** Given that \\(AC\\) and \\(BE\\) are perpendicular, this hints at a relationship involving angles or possibly the Pythagorean theorem.\n- **Unknown Side \\(AD\\):** We need to find the greatest integer less than \\(AD\\). This suggests that \\(AD\\) is not necessarily an integer, or we at least need to consider its integer part.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Coordinate Geometry:** Assign coordinates to the vertices to leverage the perpendicular condition.\n- **Pythagorean Theorem:** Since the lines are perpendicular, perhaps the Pythagorean theorem can relate the sides.\n- **Midpoint Theorem:** Maybe the midpoint plays a key role in establishing the relationship between the sides.\n\nAt this point, I feel like using **coordinate geometry** might be a solid starting point. It allows me to visualize the rectangle and easily apply the perpendicular condition.\n\n### **Step 1: Assigning Coordinates**\n\nLet's assign coordinates to each vertex for clarity:\n\n- \\(A(0, 0)\\): Lower left corner\n- \\(B(100, 0)\\): Since \\(AB = 100\\), move 100 units to the right along the x-axis\n- \\(E\\) is the midpoint of \\(\\overline{AD}\\): So, \\(E\\left(0, \\frac{AD}{2}\\right)\\)\n- \\(D(0, AD)\\): Since \\(E\\) is the midpoint, \\(D\\) is at \\(y = AD\\)\n\n**Checking:** Does this make sense? Yes, assigning coordinates based on the given lengths and midpoints aligns with how rectangles are structured.\n\n### **Step 2: Determining Coordinates of \\(C\\)**\n\nWe need to find \\(C\\). Since \\(AB = 100\\) and \\(AD = x\\) (let's call \\(AD = x\\)), the coordinates will be:\n\n- \\(C(100, AD) = (100, x)\\)\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, does this seem right? Yes, because \\(C\\) is directly above \\(B\\) since it's a rectangle.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Slopes of \\(AC\\) and \\(BE\\)**\n\nTo use the property of perpendicular lines, let's calculate the slopes of \\(AC\\) and \\(BE\\).\n\n**Slope Formula:** The slope \\(m\\) between two points \\((y_1, y_1)\\) and \\((y_2, y_2)\\) is \\(m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\).\n\n**Calculating Slope of \\(AC\\):**\n\n\\[\nAC: A(0, 0) \\rightarrow C(100, x)\n\\]\n\\[\nm_{AC} = \\frac{x - 0}{100 - 0} = \\frac{x}{100}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating Slope of \\(BE\\):**\n\n\\[\nBE: B(100, 0) \\rightarrow E\\left(0, \\frac{x}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nm_{BE} = \\frac{\\frac{x}{2} - 0}{0 - 100} = -\\frac{x}{200}\n\\]\n\n**Checking:** Wait, should the slopes add up to \\(-1\\) because the lines are perpendicular? Yes, that's the condition for perpendicular lines.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n\\[\nm_{AC} \\times m_{BE} = \\frac{x}{100} \\times -\\frac{x}{200} = -\\frac{x^2}{20000}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(AC\\) and \\(BE\\) to be perpendicular, their slopes should multiply to \\(-1\\):\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{x^2}{20000} = -1 \\implies x^2 = 20000 \\implies x = \\sqrt{20000} = 100\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Does this make sense? Let me think. The value \\(x = 100\\sqrt{2}\\) seems reasonable because \\(\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\\), so \\(x \\approx 141.4\\), which isn't too far-fetched for a rectangle side.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify if \\(x = 100\\sqrt{2}\\) satisfies all conditions.\n\n- **Perpendicular Slopes Verification:**\n\n\\[\nm_{AC} = \\frac{100\\sqrt{2}}{100} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nm_{BE} = -\\frac{100\\sqrt{2}}{200} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nm_{AC} \\times m_{BE} = \\sqrt{2} \\times -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Yes, the product is \\(-1\\), confirming that \\(AC\\) and \\(BE\\) are indeed perpendicular.\n\n**Conclusion:** The value \\(AD = 100\\sqrt{2}\\) fulfills the condition of the lines being perpendicular.\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Greatest Integer Less Than \\(AD\\)**\n\nWe need the greatest integer less than \\(AD\\):\n\n\\[\nAD = 100\\sqrt{2} \\approx 141.4\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The greatest integer less than \\(AD\\) is **141**.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Using coordinate geometry was effective here. It allowed me to clearly define the rectangle's structure and apply the perpendicular condition to find \\(AD\\).\n- **Intermediate Checks:** Throughout the process, quick checks ensured that each step made sense, especially verifying the slopes' product.\n- **Conclusion Confidence:** I'm confident that \\(AD = 100\\sqrt{2}\\) and thus the greatest integer less than \\(AD\\) is **141**, as all conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Final Answer:** \n\\[\n\\boxed{141}\n\\]\n\nThis walkthrough shows how brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying conditions lead to a confident and correct solution.",

As $ABCD$ is a rectangle, triangles $BCA$, and $ABE$ are also right triangles. By $AA$, $\\triangle FBA \\sim \\triangle BCA$, and $\\triangle FBA \\sim \\triangle ABE$, so $\\triangle ABE \\sim \\triangle BCA$. This gives $\\frac {AE}{AB}= \\frac {AB}{BC}$. $AE=\\frac{AD}{2}$ and $BC=AD$, so $\\frac {AD}{2AB}= \\frac {AB}{AD}$, or $(AD)^2=2(AB)^2$, so $AD=AB \\sqrt{2}$, or $100 \\sqrt{2}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{141}$."
