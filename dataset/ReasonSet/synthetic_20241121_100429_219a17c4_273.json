  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll tackle it just like I would if I were solving it on paper\u2014starting with brainstorming different strategies, checking my work as I go, and being willing to change approaches if needed.\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem involves a linear equation: \n\n\\[\n4x + 7y + c = 0\n\\]\n\nWe're told that the sum of the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-intercepts is \\(22\\), and we need to find the value of \\(c\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Intercepts:** I remember that intercepts are where the line crosses the axes. The \\(x\\)-intercept is where \\(y = 0\\), and the \\(y\\)-intercept is where \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Sum of Intercepts:** The problem specifies that the sum of these intercepts is \\(22\\). This seems crucial.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Find Intercepts Separately:** Calculate both intercepts in terms of \\(c\\) and set their sum to \\(22\\}.\n  - **Use Symmetry:** Maybe there's a shortcut if the intercepts have a specific relationship.\n  - **Substitute Values:** Plug in numbers to check, but that might be inefficient.\n\nHmm, I think the most straightforward way is to find the intercepts individually and then use their sum. Let's start there and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Calculating the \\(x\\)-Intercept**\n\n**Approach:**  \nFind where the line crosses the \\(x\\)-axis by setting \\(y = 0\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If \\(y = 0\\), the equation simplifies, making it easier to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n4x + 7(0) + c = 0 \\implies 4x + c = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n4x = -c \\implies x = -\\frac{c}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?**  \n  Yeah, setting \\(y = 0\\) simplified the equation nicely. The \\(x\\)-intercept is \\(-\\frac{c}{4}\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- If \\(c = 0\\), then \\(x = 0\\). That checks out because a line through the origin would have intercepts at zero.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Calculating the \\(y\\)-Intercept**\n\n**Approach:**  \nFind where the line crosses the \\(y\\)-axis by setting \\(x = 0\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Similarly, setting \\(x = 0\\) should simplify the equation to solve for \\(y\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n4(0) + 7y + c = 0 \\implies 7y + c = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n7y = -c \\implies y = -\\frac{c}{7}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?**  \n  Yes, setting \\(x = 0\\) gave us a straightforward equation for \\(y\\). The \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(-\\frac{c}{7}\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- If \\(c = 0\\), then \\(y = 0\\). Again, this makes sense as the line would pass through the origin.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Setting Up the Sum of Intercepts**\n\n**Approach:**  \nAccording to the problem, the sum of the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-intercepts is \\(22\\). Let's set up an equation to reflect this.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Add the expressions for both intercepts and set the sum equal to \\(22\\).\n- This will create an equation involving \\(c\\) that we can solve.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{c}{4} + \\left(-\\frac{c}{7}\\right) = 22\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\[\n-\\left(\\frac{c}{4} + \\frac{c}{7}\\right) = 22\n\\]\n\nFind a common denominator to combine the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-\\left(\\frac{7c}{28} + \\frac{4c}{28}\\right) = 22 \\implies -\\frac{11c}{28} = 22\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is This Correct?**  \n  The common denominator approach seems right. Combining the fractions gives \\(-\\frac{11c}{28}\\), which looks correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Multiply both sides by \\(-1\\) to eliminate the negative:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11c}{28} = -22\n\\]\n\n- That seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Solving for \\(c\\)**\n\n**Approach:**  \nIsolate \\(c\\) by multiplying both sides of the equation to get rid of the fraction.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To solve for \\(c\\), I'll multiply both sides by \\(28\\) to eliminate the denominator, then divide by \\(11\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n28 \\times \\frac{11c}{28} = 28 \\times (-22) \\implies 11c = -616\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by \\(11\\):\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{-616}{11} \\implies c = -56\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?**  \n  The calculations seem correct. Multiplying to clear the denominator and then dividing by \\(11\\) yields \\(c = -56\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Verify the Sum of Intercepts:**\n  - \\(x\\)-intercept: \\(-\\frac{-56}{4} = 14\\)\n  - \\(y\\)-intercept: \\(-\\frac{-56}{7} = 8\\)\n  - Sum: \\(14 + 8 = 22\\)\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The sum matches the given condition, so \\(c = -56\\) is indeed correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nc = -56  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n## **Wrapping Up**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Strategy Choice:**  \n  Starting with calculating the intercepts individually was an effective approach. It allowed me to set up a straightforward equation based on the given condition.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  Checking the sum of the intercepts with the calculated \\(c\\) value confirmed that the solution was correct.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Throughout the process, regularly checking each step helped catch any potential errors early, ensuring the correctness of the final answer.\n\n**Alternate Strategies Considered:**\n\n- **Using Symmetry:**  \n  Initially thought about looking for a symmetric relationship between the intercepts, but it wasn't necessary.\n\n- **Substituting Values:**  \n  Considered plugging in sample values for \\(c\\) to verify, but solving algebraically was more efficient.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy systematically calculating the intercepts, setting up the required sum, and solving for \\(c\\), we arrived at the correct solution: \n\n\\[\nc = -56\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThat's it! By thinking through each step, reflecting, and checking along the way, I was able to solve the problem accurately.",
  "ground_truth": "The $x$-intercept occurs when $y=0$. Plugging in we have $4x+7(0)+c=0$, so $4x=-c$ and $x=-\\frac{c}{4}$. The $y$-intercept occurs when $x=0$, so we plug in to find $4(0)+7y+c=0$, so $7y=-c$ and $y=-\\frac{c}{7}$. We are given that $\\left(-\\frac{c}{4}\\right)+\\left(-\\frac{c}{7}\\right)=22$. We solve for $c$ by multiplying through by a common denominator, which is $28$. This gives $7(-c)+4(-c)=22(28)$, so $-11c=22(28)$. Cancelling a factor of $11$ we have $-c=2(28)=56$, so $c=\\boxed{-56}$."
