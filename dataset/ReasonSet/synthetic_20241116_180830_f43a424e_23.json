    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting along the way, checking if my approach is correct, and adjusting as needed. Let's see where this takes us.\n\n## **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, here's the problem:\n\nChandra and Bob are reading the same **760-page** novel. Each has a different reading speed:\n- **Alice**: 1 page in **20 seconds**\n- **Bob**: 1 page in **45 seconds**\n- **Chandra**: 1 page in **30 seconds**\n\nChandra reads from page **1** to a certain page **x**, and Bob reads from page **x+1** to page **760**. They want to finish reading in the **same amount of time**. We need to find the last page **x** that Chandra should read so they both spend the same amount of time reading.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Total Time Equalization:** Chandra's and Bob's reading times should be equal.\n- **Given**: Their reading speeds and the total number of pages.\n- **Goal**: Determine the page number **x** where Chandra stops, ensuring both spend the same time reading.\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n\n1. **Total Time Calculation for Both:**\n   - Calculate how long each would take individually based on the number of pages they read.\n   - Set their total reading times equal and solve for **x**.\n\n2. **Check by Iteration:**\n   - Start with **x** = 1 and incrementally check if their reading times match until the correct **x** is found.\n  \n3. **Algebraic Approach:**\n   - Use algebra to set up an equation based on their reading times and solve for **x**.\n\n4. **Graphical Method:**\n   - Although less practical without a graphing tool, plotting their reading times could visually indicate where they align.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The **Total Time Calculation** seems the most straightforward.\n- The **Check by Iteration** might be time-consuming manually but could serve as a verification method.\n- **Algebraic Approach** could simplify the calculation.\n- The **Graphical Method** isn't practical here, but it's worth noting for more visual learners.\n\nI'll start with the **Total Time Calculation** method because it directly addresses the problem by equating their reading times. If it gets too complex, I'll pivot to the **Algebraic Approach**.\n\n## **Step 1: Calculating Total Time for Each Reader**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure both spend the same time reading, I need to express their reading times in terms of **x** (the last page Chandra reads).\n\n- **Chandra's Reading Time (T\u2097):**\n  - Pages 1 to **x**: Total **x** pages\n  - Time per page: 30 seconds\n  - Formula: \\( T\u2097 = x \\times 30 \\)\n\n- **Bob's Reading Time (T\u0299):**\n  - Pages **x**+1 to 760: Total \\( 760 - x \\) pages\n  - Time per page: 45 seconds\n  - Formula: \\( T\u0299 = (760 - x) \\times 45 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems like a good start. By expressing both times in terms of **x**, I can set them equal to find the desired page number.\n\n## **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince both Chandra and Bob should spend the same amount of time reading, I can set their time equations equal:\n\n\\[ \nx \\times 30 = (760 - x) \\times 45 \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Units: Both sides are time in seconds, so the equation is dimensionally consistent.\n- Structure: The equation balances the total reading time for both, considering their respective page ranges.\n\nThis looks correct.\n\n## **Step 3: Solving the Equation for x**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to solve for **x**. Let's expand and simplify the equation.\n\n\\[ \n30x = 760 \\times 45 - x \\times 45 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n30x + 45x = 760 \\times 45 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n75x = 760 \\times 45 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{760 \\times 45}{75} \n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's break this down to avoid mistakes:\n\n- \\( 760 \\times 45 = 34,200 \\)\n  \n  (Wait, let me double-check this multiplication)\n\n  - \\( 760 \\times 40 = 30,400 \\)\n  - \\( 760 \\times 5 = 3,800 \\)\n  - Adding them: \\( 30,400 + 3,800 = 34,200 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAlright, that looks correct.\n\nNow, divide by 75:\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{34,200}{75} \n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n\nLet's simplify this fraction step by step:\n\n- Divide both numerator and denominator by 25:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{34,200 \u00f7 25}{75 \u00f7 25} = \\frac{1,368}{3} \n\\]\n\n- Now, divide \\( 1,368 \\) by \\( 3 \\):\n\n\\[ \n1,368 \u00f7 3 = 456 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, **x = 456**. Chandra should read up to page 456 for both to spend the same amount of time.\n\nBut wait, let's pause and verify this result. Does it make sense? Let me do a quick check.\n\n## **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to ensure that when Chandra reads up to page 456 and Bob starts from page 457 to 760, their total reading times are indeed equal.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Chandra's Reading Time:**\n  - Pages 1 to 456: \\( 456 \\times 30 = 13,680 \\) seconds\n\n    (Quick check: \\( 456 \u00d7 30 = 13,680 \\) is accurate \u2714\ufe0f)\n\n- **Bob's Reading Time:**\n  - Pages 457 to 760: \\( 760 - 456 = 304 \\) pages\n  - Time: \\( 304 \\times 45 = 13,680 \\) seconds\n\n    (Quick check: \\( 304 \u00d7 45 = 13,680 \\) is accurate \u2714\ufe0f)\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth Chandra and Bob spend **13,680 seconds** reading, which confirms that our solution is correct. The reading times are equal.\n\n## **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nBy setting up an equation based on their reading times and solving for **x**, we determined that Chandra should read up to page **456**. This ensures that both she and Bob spend the same amount of time reading the novel.\n\n**Summary of the Process:**\n1. **Calculated Total Reading Times:** Expressed both Chandra's and Bob's reading times in terms of **x**.\n2. **Set Up and Solved the Equation:** Equated their reading times and solved for **x**.\n3. **Verified the Solution:** Checked the reading times to ensure they are equal.\n4. **Conclusively Determined **x = 456**: Finalized the last page Chandra should read.\n\nBy following this step-by-step approach, reflecting and verifying at each stage, we've confidently arrived at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n**Alternate Check: Iterative Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo further ensure correctness, let's briefly consider the **Check by Iteration** method, where we start with small values of **x** and incrementally check if their reading times match.\n\n**Example Cases:**\n\n- **x = 1:**\n  - Chandra: \\( 1 \\times 30 = 30 \\) seconds\n  - Bob: \\( 759 \\times 45 = 34,455 \\) seconds\n  - Difference: \\( 34,455 - 30 = 34,425 \\) seconds\n\n    (Wait, that's a huge difference! Clearly, **x = 1** is not close.)\n\n- **x = 456:** \n  - As calculated earlier, both spend **13,680** seconds.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis iterative approach would be time-consuming but serves as a validation method. It confirms that our algebraic method is correct since, at **x = 456**, their reading times align perfectly.\n\n**Final Note:**\n\nBy brainstorming multiple strategies, selecting the most efficient one, and continuously reflecting and verifying each step, we've successfully solved the problem. Always checking and being open to alternative methods ensures accuracy and deepens problem-solving understanding.",

  "ground_truth": "The ratio of time it takes Bob to read a page to the time it takes Chandra to read a page is $45:30$ or $3:2,$ so Bob should read $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the number of pages that Chandra reads. Divide the book into $5$ parts, each with $\\frac{760}{5}=152$ pages. Chandra will read the first $3\\cdot152 =\\boxed{456}$ pages, while Bob reads the last $2\\cdot152=304$ pages."
