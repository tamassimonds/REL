  "problem": "A woman labels the squares of a very large chessboard $1$ through $64$. On each square $k$, the woman puts $2^k$ grains of rice. How many more grains of rice are placed on the $10^{th}$ square than on the first $8$ squares combined?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like solving it naturally. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, and reflect along the way to ensure the approach is correct. If something doesn't work, I'll pivot and try another method.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have a chessboard with 64 squares, each labeled from 1 to 64. On each square \\( k \\), there are \\( 2^k \\) grains of rice.\n\n**Wait a minute...** Isn't this similar to that famous wheat and chessboard problem where the grains double on each square? But here, it starts from \\( 2^1 \\) instead of \\( 2^0 \\). Interesting!\n\n**The Goal:**  \nFind how many more grains are on the 10th square than on the first 8 squares combined.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**  \n- **Option 1:** Calculate the grains on the 10th square and the sum of the first 8 squares, then find the difference.\n- **Option 2:** Look for a pattern or formula to simplify the calculations.\n- **Option 3:** Use geometric series properties since it's exponential growth.\n\n**Hmm...** Calculating each square individually might be straightforward but could be time-consuming. Maybe leveraging a formula could be more efficient. Let's explore.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Grains on the 10th Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nStart by finding the number of grains on the 10th square since it's a single value.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ \n\\text{Grains on the 10th square} = 2^{10} \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n\\( 2^{10} = 1,024 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, that was straightforward. So, there are 1,024 grains on the 10th square. This number seems reasonable given the exponential growth.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Total Grains on the First 8 Squares**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to find the sum of grains from the 1st to the 8th square. This sounds like adding up \\( 2^1 \\) to \\( 2^8 \\).\n\n**But wait...** Isn't this just the sum of a geometric series? Maybe I can use the formula to make it quicker.\n\n**Formula for the Sum of a Geometric Series:**  \n\\[ \nS_n = a \\frac{(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} \n\\]  \nWhere:  \n- \\( S_n \\) is the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms,\n- \\( a \\) is the first term,\n- \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\n**For our case:**  \n- \\( a = 2 \\) (since \\( 2^1 = 2 \\)),\n- \\( r = 2 \\),\n- \\( n = 8 \\).\n\n**Applying the Formula:**  \n\\[ \nS_8 = 2 \\frac{(2^8 - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2 \\times (256 - 1) = 2 \\times 255 = 510 \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet's break it down to ensure it's correct.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2^1 &= 2 \\\\ \n2^2 &= 4 \\\\ \n2^3 &= 8 \\\\ \n2^4 &= 16 \\\\ \n2^5 &= 32 \\\\ \n2^6 &= 64 \\\\ \n2^7 &= 128 \\\\ \n2^8 &= 256 \\\\ \n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAdding them up:  \n\\[ \n2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 = 510 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe sum checks out. So, there are 510 grains on the first 8 squares combined. Using the formula saved time and ensured accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Difference**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to find how many more grains are on the 10th square compared to the sum of the first 8 squares.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ \n\\text{Difference} = 1,024 - 510 = 514 \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Given that the 10th square has over a thousand grains and the first 8 squares combined have just over five hundred, a difference of 514 seems plausible.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe calculation appears correct. The difference is significant, which aligns with the exponential growth pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \n- **Magnitude:** The 10th square alone has more grains than the first 8 squares combined, which makes sense due to the doubling nature.\n- **Difference Value:** 514 is a reasonable difference given the numbers involved.\n\n**Random Insight:**  \nThis problem highlights how exponential growth quickly outpaces linear sums. It's fascinating to see how just a few squares ahead can have such a large impact.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>514 grains</ANSWER>**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are **514 more grains** of rice on the 10th square than on the first 8 squares combined.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap and Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Approach:** Started with calculating each component separately, which worked well.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Considered using a geometric series formula, which proved efficient.\n- **Verification:** Performed quick checks at each step to ensure accuracy.\n- **Final Validation:** The answer aligns with the expected outcome based on exponential growth.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nTaking a methodical approach, checking each step, and being open to adjusting strategies ensures that the solution is both efficient and accurate. It's essential to validate each part of the process to avoid errors and confirm the correctness of the final answer.\n\n---\n\nThere we have it! By carefully stepping through the problem, reflecting at each stage, and verifying our calculations, we arrived confidently at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "The $10^{th}$ square receives $2^{10}=1024$ grains. The first $8$ squares receive $2+2^2+\\dots+2^8=2\\left(\\frac{2^8-1}{2-1}\\right)=2(256-1)=2(255)=510$. Thus the $10^{th}$ square receives $1024-510=\\boxed{514}$ more grains than the first $8$ combined."
