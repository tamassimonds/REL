    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I want to make sure I explore different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the expression \\(\\frac{1-i}{2+3i}\\), where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit and \\(i^2 = -1\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \n- This looks like a complex fraction involving imaginary numbers.  \n- I remember learning about complex conjugates as a way to simplify such fractions.  \n- Maybe I can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate \\(i\\) from the denominator.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**  \n1. **Use the Conjugate:** Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to make the denominator a real number.\n2. **Direct Division:** Attempt to divide the numerator by the denominator directly, though this might be more complicated.\n3. **Alternative Methods:** Consider other algebraic techniques, but the conjugate method seems most straightforward.\n\nGiven these options, using the conjugate seems like the best path forward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying the Conjugate**\n\nThe denominator is \\(2 + 3i\\). The conjugate of a complex number \\(a + bi\\) is \\(a - bi\\). So, the conjugate of \\(2 + 3i\\) is \\(2 - 3i\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Multiplying by the conjugate should eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator.  \n- This will make the denominator a real number, simplifying the fraction.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Does this make sense? Yes, because multiplying a complex number by its conjugate always results in a real number.  \n- Proceeding with confidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Multiplying Numerator and Denominator by the Conjugate**\n\nI\u2019ll multiply both the numerator and denominator by \\(2 - 3i\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1-i}{2+3i} \\times \\frac{2-3i}{2-3i}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- This is essentially multiplying by 1, so the value of the expression doesn\u2019t change.  \n- Let\u2019s see what happens when we perform this multiplication.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Is multiplying by the conjugate always valid? Yes, as long as the conjugate is non-zero.  \n- Ready to proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Denominator**\n\nFirst, let's focus on the denominator:\n\n\\[\n(2 + 3i)(2 - 3i)\n\\]\n\nUsing the difference of squares formula:\n\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = (2)^2 - (3i)^2 = 4 - 9(-1) = 4 + 9 = 13\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- The imaginary parts cancel out, leaving only a real number.  \n- This is exactly what I expected.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Does 4 + 9 = 13 make sense? Absolutely.  \n- The denominator is now a real number, which simplifies our fraction nicely.  \n- Good to go!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Numerator**\n\nNow, let's multiply the numerators:\n\n\\[\n(1 - i)(2 - 3i)\n\\]\n\nI\u2019ll use the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\n1. **First:** \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\)  \n2. **Outside:** \\(1 \\times (-3i) = -3i\\)  \n3. **Inside:** \\(-i \\times 2 = -2i\\)  \n4. **Last:** \\(-i \\times (-3i) = 3i^2\\)  \n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n2 - 3i - 2i + 3i^2\n\\]\n\nSince \\(i^2 = -1\\), substitute:\n\n\\[\n2 - 3i - 2i + 3(-1) = 2 - 3i - 2i - 3\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n(2 - 3) + (-3i - 2i) = -1 - 5i\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- After distributing, I combined the real parts and the imaginary parts.  \n- The \\(i^2\\) term converted to a real number because \\(i^2 = -1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Does \\(-1 - 5i\\) seem correct? Yes, the calculations check out.  \n- No mistakes here, so I can move on.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Putting It All Together**\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1 - 5i}{13}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- The denominator is a real number (13), which is what I wanted.  \n- The numerator is a complex number with both real and imaginary parts.  \n- I can leave the fraction as is or split it into real and imaginary components.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- It's often cleaner to express complex numbers in the form \\(a + bi\\).  \n- Let's separate the real and imaginary parts.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Simplifying the Fraction**\n\nI\u2019ll divide both the real and imaginary parts of the numerator by the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1}{13} + \\frac{-5i}{13} = -\\frac{1}{13} - \\frac{5}{13}i\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- By splitting the fraction, I ensure the complex number is in standard form.  \n- This makes it easier to interpret and verify.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Does this final form make sense? Yes, it's neat and matches the expected format for a complex number.  \n- The solution seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1-i}{2+3i} = -\\frac{1}{13} - \\frac{5}{13}i\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Strategy Used:** Multiplying by the conjugate was the most straightforward and effective method.  \n- **Verification:** Each step was checked for correctness, ensuring no errors in calculations.  \n- **Result:** The complex fraction was successfully simplified to its standard form.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \n- The conjugate method worked well, confirming its validity for simplifying complex fractions.  \n- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps made the process manageable and error-free.  \n- Always good to check each step to catch any potential mistakes early.\n\nAlright, I hope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding how to simplify complex fractions step by step!",
