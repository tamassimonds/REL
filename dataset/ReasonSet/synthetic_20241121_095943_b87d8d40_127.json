  "problem": "I have a bag with $6$ marbles numbered from $1$ to $6.$ Mathew has a bag with $12$ marbles numbered from $1$ to $12.$ Mathew chooses one marble from his bag and I choose two from mine. In how many ways can we choose the marbles (where the order of my choices does matter) such that the sum of the numbers on my marbles equals the number on his?",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem step by step, emulating a natural human thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check for correctness as I proceed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem:\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Okay, so both Mathew and I are drawing marbles with numbers. The goal is for the sum of the numbers on my two marbles to equal the number on Mathew's marble. It sounds like a matching sums problem.\n\n- **Potential Strategies:**\n  1. **List All Possible Combinations:** Maybe list all possible sums from my marbles and see which match Mathew's numbers.\n  2. **Use Probability or Combinatorics:** Perhaps calculate the number of favorable outcomes using combinatorial techniques.\n  3. **Symmetry or Patterns:** Look for patterns or symmetry to simplify the problem.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** Hmm, listing all combinations might be tedious. Combinatorics could be more efficient, but I need to ensure I account for the order of my marbles since it matters.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: List All Combinations**\n\nLet's try listing all possible sums from my marbles to see which ones match Mathew's numbers.\n\n- **Thought Process:** I have 6 marbles numbered 1 to 6. Choosing two marbles where the order matters means I need to consider permutations.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - Total ways to choose two ordered marbles: \n  \\[\n  6 \\times 5 = 30\n  \\] \n  (since for each first choice, there are 5 remaining options).\n  \n- **Listing Ordered Pairs and Their Sums:**\n\n  ```\n  (1,2) -> 3\n  (1,3) -> 4\n  (1,4) -> 5\n  (1,5) -> 6\n  (1,6) -> 7\n  (2,1) -> 3\n  (2,3) -> 5\n  (2,4) -> 6\n  (2,5) -> 7\n  (2,6) -> 8\n  (3,1) -> 4\n  (3,2) -> 5\n  (3,4) -> 7\n  (3,5) -> 8\n  (3,6) -> 9\n  (4,1) -> 5\n  (4,2) -> 6\n  (4,3) -> 7\n  (4,5) -> 9\n  (4,6) -> 10\n  (5,1) -> 6\n  (5,2) -> 7\n  (5,3) -> 8\n  (5,4) -> 9\n  (5,6) -> 11\n  (6,1) -> 7\n  (6,2) -> 8\n  (6,3) -> 9\n  (6,4) -> 10\n  (6,5) -> 11\n  ```\n\n- **Reflection:** Wow, that's a lot of pairs. But it gives us all possible sums ranging from 3 to 11.\n\n### **Checking Strategy 1: Does It Work?**\n\n- **Verification:** Now, I need to see which of these sums match the numbers on Mathew's marbles (1 to 12).\n\n- **Observation:** The possible sums from my marbles are 3 to 11. So, only Mathew's marbles numbered 3 to 11 can have matching sums.\n\n- **Thought:** Wait, Mathew has marbles numbered 1 to 12, but my sums only range from 3 to 11. This means marbles numbered 1, 2, and 12 in Mathew's bag can't be matched. Is that correct?\n\n- **Conclusion:** Yes, since the smallest sum I can make is 3 and the largest is 11, Mathew's marbles numbered 1, 2, and 12 won't have corresponding sums.\n\n### **Reflection: Is There a Better Way?**\n\n- **Idea:** Listing all pairs worked, but it's time-consuming. Perhaps there's a more efficient method using combinatorics or patterns.\n\n- **New Strategy:** Instead of listing, I can calculate the number of ways each sum can be achieved and then see how many of Mathew's marbles match those sums.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Calculate Sum Frequencies**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Let's find out how many ordered pairs produce each sum from 3 to 11.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n\n  - **Sum = 3:** (1,2), (2,1) \u2192 2 ways\n  - **Sum = 4:** (1,3), (3,1) \u2192 2 ways\n  - **Sum = 5:** (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) \u2192 4 ways\n  - **Sum = 6:** (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1) \u2192 5 ways\n  - **Sum = 7:** (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) \u2192 6 ways\n  - **Sum = 8:** (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2) \u2192 5 ways\n  - **Sum = 9:** (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3) \u2192 4 ways\n  - **Sum = 10:** (4,6), (5,5), (6,4) \u2192 3 ways\n  - **Sum = 11:** (5,6), (6,5) \u2192 2 ways\n\n- **Reflection:** By calculating the frequencies, I can see how many ways each sum can be achieved. This seems more efficient than listing all pairs.\n\n### **Checking Strategy 2: Does It Work?**\n\n- **Verification:** Now, let's see how many of Mathew's marbles have numbers that match these sums.\n\n- **Matching Sums:**\n\n  - **Mathew's marble = 3:** 2 ways\n  - **Mathew's marble = 4:** 2 ways\n  - **Mathew's marble = 5:** 4 ways\n  - **Mathew's marble = 6:** 5 ways\n  - **Mathew's marble = 7:** 6 ways\n  - **Mathew's marble = 8:** 5 ways\n  - **Mathew's marble = 9:** 4 ways\n  - **Mathew's marble = 10:** 3 ways\n  - **Mathew's marble = 11:** 2 ways\n\n- **Total Ways:** Adding these up:  \n  \\[\n  2 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 33\n  \\] \n  ways\n\n- **Thought:** Wait a minute, earlier I mentioned there are 30 ordered pairs. But now I'm getting 33. Something's off here.\n\n### **Identifying and Correcting the Mistake**\n\n- **Reflection:** Oh, I see the mistake. When calculating the sum frequencies, I included pairs like (3,3) and (5,5), but those don't exist since I'm only choosing distinct marbles.\n\n- **Correction:**\n\n  - **Sum = 6:** (1,5), (2,4), (4,2), (5,1) \u2192 **4 ways** (ignore (3,3) since it's not possible)\n  - **Sum = 8:** (2,6), (3,5), (5,3), (6,2) \u2192 **4 ways** (ignore (4,4))\n  - **Sum = 10:** (4,6), (5,5), (6,4) \u2192 **2 ways** (ignore (5,5))\n\n- **Updated Frequencies:**  \n\n  - **Sum = 3:** 2 ways\n  - **Sum = 4:** 2 ways\n  - **Sum = 5:** 4 ways\n  - **Sum = 6:** 4 ways\n  - **Sum = 7:** 6 ways\n  - **Sum = 8:** 4 ways\n  - **Sum = 9:** 4 ways\n  - **Sum = 10:** 2 ways\n  - **Sum = 11:** 2 ways\n\n- **Total Ways:**  \n  \\[\n  2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 30\n  \\] \n  ways\n\n- **Conclusion:** Now it matches the total number of ordered pairs. So, there are 30 ways to choose my marbles such that their sum matches one of Mathew's marbles.\n\n### **Final Check: Is the Answer Reasonable?**\n\n- **Thought:** Given that there are 30 ordered pairs in total and all have distinct sums within the range of Mathew's marbles, it makes sense that there are 30 successful outcomes.\n\n- **Quick Verification:** Since each ordered pair corresponds to a unique sum, and all sums are between 3 and 11, every ordered pair has a matching marble in Mathew's bag.\n\n- **Final Reflection:** Everything aligns now. The initial overcounting mistake has been corrected, and the total number of favorable outcomes is consistent with the total number of ordered pairs.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> 30 ways</ANSWER>**\n\nThere are **30** ways to choose the marbles such that the sum of the numbers on my marbles equals the number on Mathew's marble.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by considering listing all combinations, then moved to calculating sum frequencies for efficiency.\n\n- **Reflection and Checking:** Identified and corrected an overcounting mistake by recognizing that some sums included invalid pairs (e.g., (3,3)).\n\n- **Final Verification:** Ensured that the total number of favorable outcomes matched the total number of ordered pairs, confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\nThrough this reflective and iterative process, I arrived at the correct answer, demonstrating how natural corrections and checks play a crucial role in problem-solving.",
  "ground_truth": "We could proceed by listing the various cases, depending on which number Mathew draws.  \\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\\hline\n\\text{Mathew's number} & \\text{My pair of numbers} \\\\ \\hline\n1 & - \\\\ \\hline\n2 & - \\\\ \\hline\n3 & (1,2), (2,1) \\\\ \\hline\n4 & (1,3), (3,1) \\\\ \\hline\n5 & (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) \\\\ \\hline\n6 & (1,5), (2,4), (4,2), (5,1) \\\\ \\hline\n7 & (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) \\\\ \\hline\n8 & (2,6), (3,5), (5,3), (6,2) \\\\ \\hline\n9 & (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3) \\\\ \\hline\n10 & (4,6), (6,4) \\\\ \\hline\n11 & (5,6), (6,5) \\\\ \\hline\n12 & - \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\] The answer is $2+2+4+4+6+4+4+2+2 = \\boxed{30}.$\n\nThere is a much easier solution: there are $6 \\times 5 = 30$ choices for the two marbles that I draw. Once I draw my two marbles, there is only $1$ way for Mathew to draw the marble which has the sum of my two marbles. So the total number of possibilities is just equal to the number of ways in which I can draw my two marbles, which is $\\boxed{30}.$"
