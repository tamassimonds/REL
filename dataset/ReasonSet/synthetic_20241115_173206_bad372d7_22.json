If something doesn't seem right, I'll pivot and try a different method. Let's see where this journey takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we have a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well with walls at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = a\\). Then, the right wall is slowly moved from \\(x = a\\) to \\(x = 4a\\). We need to calculate the work done in this process in terms of \\(E\\), where \\(E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2ma^2}\\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Potential Well Basics:** I remember that in a quantum mechanical infinite potential well, the energy levels depend on the width of the well. When the width changes, so do the energy levels.\n  \n- **Work Done:** In quantum mechanics, the work done on a system can be related to the change in its energy. But how exactly? Maybe integrating the energy change over the width?\n\n- **Reflection:** The options provided are multiples of \\(E\\), which suggests that the work done is some fraction of the energy associated with the initial well width.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIt sounds like I need to find out how the energy levels change as the width of the well changes and then determine the total work done over that change.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Options I'm Considering:**\n\n1. **Calculate Energy Levels Before and After:**  \n   - Find the energy levels for the initial width \\(a\\) and the final width \\(4a\\).\n   - Determine the difference in energy and integrate if necessary.\n\n2. **Use Adiabatic Approximation:**  \n   - Since the wall is moved slowly, maybe the energy levels adjust gradually.\n   - Could this simplify the calculations?\n\n3. **Consider Different Quantum States:**  \n   - Perhaps only certain quantum states contribute to the work done.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe first option seems the most straightforward: calculate the energy levels at both widths and find the work done. The adiabatic approximation might help, but I'm not entirely sure if it's necessary. Let\u2019s start with calculating the energy levels and see where that leads.\n\n**Decision:**  \nI'll proceed with calculating the energy levels for both widths and then determine the work done.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Energy Levels**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI know that for an infinite potential well, the energy levels are determined by the width of the well and can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nE_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m L^2}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(n\\) is the quantum number (1, 2, 3, ...),\n- \\(L\\) is the width of the well,\n- \\(\\hbar\\) is the reduced Planck's constant,\n- \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle.\n\n**Applying to Our Problem:**\n\n1. **Initial Width \\(L_i = a\\):**\n   \\[\n   E_{n,i} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m a^2} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m a^2} = E n^2\n   \\]\n   (Given: \\(E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m a^2}\\))\n\n2. **Final Width \\(L_f = 4a\\):**\n   \\[\n   E_{n,f} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m (4a)^2} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{32m a^2} = \\frac{1}{16} E n^2\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the energy levels change based on the square of the width. When the well expands from \\(a\\) to \\(4a\\), the energy levels decrease, specifically by a factor of \\(1/16\\).\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, because increasing the width of the well lowers the energy levels, which aligns with classical intuition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determining the Work Done**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe work done in moving the wall is related to the change in energy of the system. Since the wall is moved slowly, we can think of this as an integral over the change in energy.\n\n**Calculating the Change in Energy:**\n\n1. **Energy Difference per Level \\( \\Delta E_n \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\Delta E_n = E_{n,f} - E_{n,i} = \\frac{1}{16} E n^2 - E n^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{16} - 1\\right) E n^2 = -\\frac{15}{16} E n^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Work Done \\( W \\):**\n   - Since the well expands from \\(a\\) to \\(4a\\), we need to integrate this energy difference over the quantum numbers.\n   - However, in this case, it seems we're only considering the first quantum state (\\(n = 1\\)), as higher states would involve more complex interactions.\n\n\\[\nW = \\int \\Delta E_n \\, dn = \\int_{n=1}^{\\infty} -\\frac{15}{16} E n^2 \\, dn\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute\u2014integrating from 1 to infinity? That seems too broad. Maybe we're only considering the first quantum state, so the work done is just for \\(n = 1\\).\n\n**Correction:**  \nLet\u2019s refine this. Since we're likely dealing only with the ground state, the work done is simply:\n\n\\[\nW = -\\frac{15}{16} E\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nIs this consistent with the options provided? Yes, \\(-\\frac{15}{16} E\\) matches option (A).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Method Validity:** By calculating the energy levels before and after the wall movement and considering the change in energy, we've arrived at the work done.\n- **Consistency with Physical Intuition:** The work done is negative, indicating that energy is being removed from the system as the well expands, which makes sense.\n- **Alignment with Options:** The calculated work matches one of the provided options, confirming its correctness.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nDoes everything align? Yes, the steps logically follow, the calculations are consistent, and the final answer matches one of the given options.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically calculating the energy levels before and after moving the wall and considering the change in energy, we determined that the work done in this process is \\(-\\frac{15}{16} E\\). This approach ensured that each step was reflective and checked, leading to a confident and accurate solution.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding how to tackle such problems\u2014brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting, checking, and adjusting as needed are key steps in problem-solving.",
