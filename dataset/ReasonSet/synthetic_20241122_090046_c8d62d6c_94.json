  "solution": "### **Can a Negative Number Have a Square Root?**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this question step by step: *Can a negative number have a square root?* I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies and reflecting along the way, just like I would naturally think through a math problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see this question, my initial reaction is a bit uncertain. I remember encountering something about square roots and negative numbers in math classes, but the details are a bit fuzzy. It reminds me of imaginary numbers, but I'm not entirely sure how they fit in.\n\nLet me think... I know that squaring a number always gives a positive result if the original number is positive or negative. For example:\n\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n- \\((-3)^2 = 9\\)\n\nHmm, so if squaring both positive and negative numbers yields positive results, what happens when we try to take the square root of a negative number? It seems like there might be a complication here.\n\nBut wait, I do recall something about imaginary numbers being involved with negative square roots. Maybe that's the direction I need to explore. Let me brainstorm some strategies to see what makes sense.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Algebraic Approach:**\n   - Can I solve \\(x^2 = -1\\) for \\(x\\)?\n   \n2. **Graphical Interpretation:**\n   - What does the square root function look like on a graph?\n   \n3. **Real Numbers vs. Complex Numbers:**\n   - Do negative numbers have square roots within the real number system, or do we need to extend our number system?\n\nI think it's best to start with the **algebraic approach** to see if I can find a solution. If that doesn't work, I'll move on to the **graphical interpretation** to get a visual understanding. Finally, if needed, I'll consider the **real vs. complex numbers** idea.\n\n### **Step 1: Algebraic Approach**\n\n**First Thought:**  \nLet me attempt to find the square root of a negative number by solving the equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = -1\n\\]\n\nIf I can find a real number \\(x\\) that satisfies this equation, then negative numbers have square roots.\n\n**Attempt:**  \n\n- Taking the square root of both sides:\n\n  \\[\n  x = \\sqrt{-1}\n  \\]\n\nBut wait, I remember that in the realm of real numbers, the square root of a negative number is undefined. This reminds me of why imaginary numbers were introduced.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, in the **real number system**, there isn't a real solution for \\(x^2 = -1\\). But does that mean square roots of negative numbers don't exist at all? Maybe I need to think beyond real numbers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe algebraic approach within the real number system doesn't work. Perhaps I need to consider **complex numbers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Graphical Interpretation**\n\n**Next Thought:**  \nLet's visualize this by looking at the graph of \\(y = x^2\\). Maybe seeing it will help.\n\n**Attempt:**  \n\n- The graph of \\(y = x^2\\) is a parabola opening upwards.\n- All the y-values (outputs) are non-negative since squaring any real number yields a positive or zero result.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLooking at the graph, there's no point where \\(y = -1\\), meaning there's no real \\(x\\) such that \\(x^2 = -1\\).\n\n**Check:**  \nThis confirms my algebraic approach\u2014within real numbers, negative numbers don't have square roots.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGraphically, negative numbers don't have square roots in the real number system.\n\n### **Step 3: Real Numbers vs. Complex Numbers**\n\n**Aha Moment:**  \nWait! This reminds me of when I first learned about **complex numbers**. Maybe that's the key here.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf negative numbers don't have square roots in the real number system, perhaps they do in the **complex number system**.\n\n**Attempt:**  \n\n- Complex numbers introduce the imaginary unit \\(i\\), where \\(i^2 = -1\\).\n- So, the square root of \\(-1\\) can be represented as:\n\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{-1} = i\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis feels right. By extending our number system to include complex numbers, negative numbers can indeed have square roots.\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me verify:\n\n- If \\(x = i\\), then:\n\n  \\[\n  x^2 = i^2 = -1\n  \\]\n\nThis satisfies the original equation \\(x^2 = -1\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy introducing complex numbers, specifically the imaginary unit \\(i\\), negative numbers do have square roots. For example, the square root of \\(-1\\) is \\(i\\).\n\n### **Final Check: Does This Make Sense?**\n\n**Last Thought:**  \nLet me double-check everything to ensure that my conclusion is correct.\n\n- **Algebraic Approach:** Initially found no real solutions, leading me to consider complex numbers.\n- **Graphical Interpretation:** Confirmed that no real solutions exist.\n- **Complex Numbers:** Successfully found a solution using the imaginary unit \\(i\\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nEverything aligns\u2014negative numbers don't have square roots in the real number system, but they do in the complex number system.\n\n<ANSWER>  \n**Solution:**  \nYes, it is possible for a negative number to have a square root, but only within the complex number system. Specifically, the square root of \\(-1\\) is the imaginary unit \\(i\\), where \\(i^2 = -1\\).  \n</ANSWER>\n\n### **Closing Thoughts**\n\nLooking back, starting with the algebraic approach helped me realize the limitations of the real number system. The graphical interpretation reinforced this understanding. Finally, recalling complex numbers provided the necessary insight to solve the problem. It's a good reminder of how expanding our mathematical frameworks can lead to new solutions.\n\nHonestly, reflecting and checking each step was crucial in arriving at the correct answer. Initially, I thought it might be impossible, but exploring different strategies led me to the right conclusion.",
