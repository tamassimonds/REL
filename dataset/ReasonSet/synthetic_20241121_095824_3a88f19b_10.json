Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I see the equation \n\n\\[\nx^3 + 3x^2 - 10x = 0\n\\](x \n3\n +3x \n2\n \u221210x=0\n ),\n\nmy initial thought is that it resembles a polynomial set to zero. This reminds me of problems where factoring can help find the roots (solutions for \nx\nx). But honestly, I\u2019m not entirely sure the best way to start, so I'll consider a few strategies:\n\n**Factoring Out Common Terms:** Maybe there's a common factor I can pull out to simplify the equation.\n**Using the Quadratic Formula:** If factoring leads to a quadratic, I can apply this.\n**Graphical Interpretation:** Visualizing the function to estimate the roots.\n**Synthetic Division:** Testing possible roots to simplify the polynomial.\nLet\u2019s explore these ideas one by one.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring Out Common Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI notice all terms have an \nx\nx, so factoring out \nx\nx might simplify things. Let's try that.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx(x^2 + 3x - 10) = 0\n\\]\nx(x \n2\n +3x\u221210)=0\nReflection:\n\nFactoring out \nx\nx leaves me with a quadratic equation inside the parentheses. This is great because now I have a product of factors equal to zero, which means I can set each factor to zero to find the solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Factored Equation**\n\nNow, I have:\n\n\\[\nx(x^2 + 3x - 10) = 0\n\\]\nx(x \n2\n +3x\u221210)=0\nThis gives me two cases:\n\nCase 1: \nx\n=\n0\nx=0\nCase 2: \nx\n2\n+\n3\nx\n\u2212\n10\n=\n0\nx \n2\n +3x\u221210=0\n**Case 1: \nx\n=\n0\nx=0**\n\n**Solution:**\n\nOne solution is straightforward: \nx\n=\n0\nx=0.\n\n**Case 2: Solving \nx\n2\n+\n3\nx\n\u2212\n10\n=\n0\nx \n2\n +3x\u221210=0**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFor the quadratic equation, I can attempt to factor it further or use the quadratic formula. Factoring would be quicker if possible, so I'll check if it factors neatly.\n\n**Attempt to Factor:**\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \n\u2212\n10\n\u221210 and add to \n3\n3.\n\nHmm... \n\u2212\n5\n\u22125 and \n2\n2 multiply to \n\u2212\n10\n\u221210 and add to \n\u2212\n3\n\u22123, but I need positive \n3\n3. Wait, that doesn't work. Maybe it\u2019s not easily factorable.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSince factoring isn't straightforward, I'll use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}\n\\]\nx= \n2a\n\u2212b\u00b1 \nb \n2\n \u22124ac\n\u200b\n \nWhere \na\n=\n1\na=1, \nb\n=\n3\nb=3, and \nc\n=\n\u2212\n10\nc=\u221210.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{{3^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-10)}}}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\nx= \n2\u22c51\n\u22123\u00b1 \n3 \n2\n \u22124\u22c51\u22c5(\u221210)\n\u200b\n \n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{{9 + 40}}}}{2}\n\\]\nx= \n2\n\u22123\u00b1 \n9+40\n\u200b\n \n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}}{2}\n\\]\nx= \n2\n\u22123\u00b1 \n49\n\u200b\n \n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-3 \\pm 7}}{2}\n\\]\nx= \n2\n\u22123\u00b17\n\u200b\n \n**Solutions:**\n\n\\[\nx_1 = \\frac{{-3 + 7}}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\nx \n1\n\u200b\n = \n2\n\u22123+7\n\u200b\n = \n2\n4\n\u200b\n =2\n\n\\[\nx_2 = \\frac{{-3 - 7}}{2} = \\frac{{-10}}{2} = -5\n\\]\nx \n2\n\u200b\n = \n2\n\u22123\u22127\n\u200b\n = \n2\n\u221210\n\u200b\n =\u22125\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAwesome!

I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step to ensure correctness, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### Initial Brainstorming: First Thoughts\n\nWhen I see the equation \nx\n3\n+\n3\nx\n2\n\u2212\n10\nx\n=\n0\nx \n3\n +3x \n2\n \u221210x=0, my first instinct is to recognize it as a cubic polynomial set equal to zero. I recall that solving such equations often involves factoring to find the roots. However, I\u2019m not entirely sure if factoring is the best approach here, so I\u2019ll consider a few strategies:\n\n1. **Factoring Out Common Terms:** Perhaps there's a common factor that can simplify the equation.\n2. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** If factoring leads to a quadratic, this formula might be useful.\n3. **Graphical Interpretation:** Visualizing the function to estimate the roots.\n4. **Synthetic Division:** Testing possible roots to simplify the polynomial.\n\nLet\u2019s explore these ideas one by one.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Factoring Out Common Terms\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLooking at the equation, I notice that all terms involve \nx\nx. This suggests that factoring out \nx\nx could simplify things. It\u2019s usually a good first step to take when all terms share a common variable.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\nx\n(\nx\n2\n+\n3\nx\n\u2212\n10\n)\n=\n0\nx(x \n2\n +3x\u221210)=0\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy factoring out \nx\nx, I\u2019ve reduced the cubic equation to a product of \nx\nx and a quadratic \n(\nx\n2\n+\n3\nx\n\u2212\n10\n)\n(x \n2\n +3x\u221210). This is helpful because it allows me to set each factor equal to zero, which is a standard technique for finding the roots.\n\n**Outcome:**  \nNow, I have two simpler equations to solve:\n\nx\n=\n0\nx=0\n\nx\n2\n+\n3\nx\n\u2212\n10\n=\n0\nx \n2\n +3x\u221210=0\n---\n\n### Step 2: Solving for the First Root\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe first equation, \nx\n=\n0\nx=0, is straightforward. This is one of the roots.\n\n**Solution:**  \n\nx\n1\n=\n0\nx \n1\n\u200b\n =0\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat was easy! One root down. Now, let\u2019s focus on the quadratic equation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Quadratic Equation\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFor the quadratic \nx\n2\n+\n3\nx\n\u2212\n10\n=\n0\nx \n2\n +3x\u221210=0, I can attempt to factor it or use the quadratic formula. Factoring is quicker if possible, so I\u2019ll try that first. However, if it doesn\u2019t factor neatly, I\u2019ll resort to the quadratic formula.\n\n**Attempt to Factor:**  \nI\u2019m looking for two numbers that multiply to \n\u2212\n10\n\u221210 (the constant term) and add to \n3\n3 (the coefficient of \nx\nx).\n\nHmm... let\u2019s see:\n\n5\n\u00d7\n(\n\u2212\n2\n)\n=\n\u2212\n10\n5\u00d7(\u22122)=\u221210 and \n5\n+\n(\n\u2212\n2\n)\n=\n3\n5+(\u22122)=3\n\nWait, that works! So, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n(\nx\n+\n5\n)\n(\nx\n\u2212\n2\n)\n=\n0\n(x+5)(x\u22122)=0\n\n**Reflection:**  \nPerfect! Factoring worked out. This gives me two additional roots.\n\n**Outcome:**  \nFrom the factored form, I have:\n\nx\n+\n5\n=\n0\n\u21d2\nx\n=\n\u2212\n5\nx+5=0\u21d2x=\u22125\n\nx\n\u2212\n2\n=\n0\n\u21d2\nx\n=\n2\nx\u22122=0\u21d2x=2\n\n**Solution:**  \n\nx\n2\n=\n\u2212\n5\nand\nx\n3\n=\n2\nx \n2\n\u200b\n =\u22125andx \n3\n\u200b\n =2\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow, I have all three roots: \nx\n=\n0\n,\nx\n=\n\u2212\n5\n,\nand\nx\n=\n2\nx=0,x=\u22125,andx=2. It\u2019s always a good idea to verify these solutions by plugging them back into the original equation, but before I do that, let\u2019s proceed to find the mean.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Mean of the Roots\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo find the mean (average) of the roots, I need to sum them up and divide by the number of roots. This is a straightforward calculation.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\nMean\n=\n0\n+\n(\n\u2212\n5\n)\n+\n2\n3\n=\n\u2212\n3\n3\n=\n\u2212\n1\nMean= \n3\n0+(\u22125)+2\n\u200b\n = \n3\n\u22123\n\u200b\n =\u22121\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe mean comes out to be \n\u2212\n1\n\u22121. I\u2019ll double-check the arithmetic to ensure there are no mistakes:\n\n0\n+\n(\n\u2212\n5\n)\n=\n\u2212\n5\n0+(\u22125)=\u22125\n\n\u2212\n5\n+\n2\n=\n\u2212\n3\n\u22125+2=\u22123\n\n\u2212\n3\n\u00f7\n3\n=\n\u2212\n1\n\u22123\u00f73=\u22121\n\nEverything checks out! The mean is indeed \n\u2212\n1\n\u22121.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Solutions\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing the answer, it\u2019s essential to verify that all roots satisfy the original equation. This step ensures that no mistakes were made during the factoring process.\n\n**Verification:**  \n\nFor \nx\n=\n0\nx=0:\n\n0\n3\n+\n3\n(\n0\n)\n2\n\u2212\n10\n(\n0\n)\n=\n0\n0 \n3\n +3(0) \n2\n \u221210(0)=0 \n\n\u2714\ufe0f Satisfied.\n\nFor \nx\n=\n\u2212\n5\nx=\u22125:\n\n(\n\u2212\n5\n)\n3\n+\n3\n(\n\u2212\n5\n)\n2\n\u2212\n10\n(\n\u2212\n5\n)\n=\n\u2212\n125\n+\n75\n+\n50\n=\n0\n(\u22125) \n3\n +3(\u22125) \n2\n \u221210(\u22125)=\u2212125+75+50=0 \n\n\u2714\ufe0f Satisfied.\n\nFor \nx\n=\n2\nx=2:\n\n2\n3\n+\n3\n(\n2\n)\n2\n\u2212\n10\n(\n2\n)\n=\n8\n+\n12\n\u2212\n20\n=\n0\n2 \n3\n +3(2) \n2\n \u221210(2)=8+12\u221220=0 \n\n\u2714\ufe0f Satisfied.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll roots satisfy the original equation, confirming that the solutions are correct.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion: Final Answer\n\n<ANSWER>\n\nThe mean of all solutions for \nx\nx is \n\u2212\n1\n\u22121.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts: Wrapping Up\n\nBy initially factoring out the common term \nx\nx and then factoring the resulting quadratic equation, I efficiently found all the roots of the original cubic equation.

Verifying the solutions ensured that no errors were made during the process.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\nBrainstorming different strategies upfront helps in choosing the most straightforward path.\nFactoring out common terms can significantly simplify polynomial equations.\nAlways verify solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure correctness.\nReflecting at each step prevents errors and confirms the validity of the approach.\n**Remember:** Taking the time to brainstorm and check each step can save time in the long run by avoiding mistakes.",
  "ground_truth": "First, we factor the equation as $x(x^2 +3x - 10) = 0$.  So, one solution is $x=0$ and the other two solutions are the solutions to $x^2 + 3x-10=0$.  We could either factor the quadratic, or note that the sum of the solutions to this quadratic is $-(3/1)=-3$, so the mean of the three solutions to the original equation is $-3/3=\\boxed{-1}$."
