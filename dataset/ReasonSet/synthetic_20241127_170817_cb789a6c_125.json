  "solution": "### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We have a monic polynomial of degree 2 with specific conditions at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\). Being **monic** means the leading coefficient is 1. This reminds me of quadratic equations I've worked with before. I\u2019m considering a few strategies:\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Use the general form of a quadratic polynomial.\n- **Strategy 2:** Factor the polynomial.\n- **Strategy 3:** Utilize the vertex form, though that seems less direct here.\n\nHonestly, **Strategy 1**\u2014using the general quadratic form\u2014seems the most straightforward. I'll start there, but I'm ready to pivot if it doesn't pan out.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: General Quadratic Form**\n\nLet me begin by recalling the general form of a monic quadratic polynomial:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + bx + c\n\\]\n\nGiven that it's monic, the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is 1. Now, I have two conditions:\n\n1. \\( f(0) = 4 \\)\n2. \\( f(1) = 10 \\)\n\nI can plug these into the equation to create a system of equations. Let's see how that works.\n\n#### **Step 1: Plugging in \\( f(0) = 4 \\)**\n\n\\[\nf(0) = 0^2 + b(0) + c = c\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( c = 4 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** That was straightforward. Knowing \\( c \\) simplifies things. Now, let\u2019s move to the next condition.\n\n#### **Step 2: Plugging in \\( f(1) = 10 \\)**\n\n\\[\nf(1) = 1^2 + b(1) + c = 1 + b + 4 = 10\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n1 + b + 4 = 10 \\\\\n5 + b = 10 \\\\\nb = 5\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Adding 1 and 4 gives 5, and to make it 10, \\( b \\) must be 5. That seems correct.\n\n### **Intermediate Reflection**\n\nSo far, I've found \\( b = 5 \\) and \\( c = 4 \\). The polynomial now looks like:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4\n\\]\n\nBut I should verify if this satisfies both given conditions before finalizing.\n\n### **Verification**\n\nLet\u2019s plug back into the original conditions to ensure everything fits.\n\n#### **Check \\( f(0) = 4 \\)**\n\n\\[\nf(0) = 0^2 + 5(0) + 4 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Result:** Matches perfectly.\n\n#### **Check \\( f(1) = 10 \\)**\n\n\\[\nf(1) = 1^2 + 5(1) + 4 = 1 + 5 + 4 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Result:** Also matches.\n\n**Final Reflection:** Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution seems correct.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy Consideration**\n\nInitially, I considered factoring the polynomial or using the vertex form, but since the general form approach worked seamlessly, there's no need to explore further. However, it's always good to have multiple strategies in mind in case the first one doesn\u2019t pan out.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy using the general form of a monic quadratic polynomial and applying the given conditions, I successfully determined the coefficients \\( b \\) and \\( c \\). The final polynomial \\( f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 \\) satisfies both \\( f(0) = 4 \\) and \\( f(1) = 10 \\).\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Starting with the most straightforward strategy allowed me to efficiently find the solution. Keeping alternative strategies in mind ensured that I was prepared to pivot if needed, but luckily, the first approach worked perfectly. Always verifying the solution against the original conditions is crucial to confirm correctness.",
  "ground_truth": "Since $f(x)$ has degree $2$, we know it is of the form $ax^2+bx+c$. A monic polynomial is one whose leading coefficient is $1$, so $a=1$. Since $f(0)=4$, we know $1(0)^2+b(0)+c=4$, so $c=4$. Since $f(1)=10$, we know $1(1)^2+b(1)+4=10$, so $b+5=10$ and $b=5$. Thus $f(x)=\\boxed{x^2+5x+4}$."
