    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it as if I'm working through it step-by-step, exploring different strategies, reflecting frequently, and checking my work along the way.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, so the problem is about Mrs. Crabapple selecting a random student to receive a crabapple each meeting. There are 11 students and her class meets four times a week. We need to find out how many different sequences of recipients are possible in a week.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a combinatorial problem involving permutations. It reminds me of problems where you need to determine the number of possible arrangements or sequences.\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure if it's purely about permutations or if there's another element involved, like combinations or the possibility of repeated selections.\n\n**Reflection:**\nLet me brainstorm a bit. I know permutations deal with the arrangement of items, especially when the order matters. But here, since selecting a student each time and they can be chosen multiple times, permutations might be the right track. \n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n\n1. **Permutations with Repetition:**\n   - Since the same student can be selected multiple times, this could be a case of permutations with repetition.\n\n2. **Counting Principles:**\n   - Using basic counting principles where each day's selection is independent of the others.\n\n3. **Tree Diagram:**\n   - Visualizing the selections using a tree diagram to enumerate all possible sequences.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI think **Permutations with Repetition** seems the most straightforward because each day's selection doesn't affect the others, and the order matters. But I'm curious if a tree diagram might help visualize it better.\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring the Permutations with Repetition Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Definition:** In permutations with repetition, the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) items where repetitions are allowed is \\( n^r \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of items (students) and \\( r \\) is the number of selections (days).\n\n- **Applying to Our Problem:**\n  - Number of students (\\( n \\)) = 11\n  - Number of days (\\( r \\)) = 4\n  - So, the total number of sequences = \\( 11^4 \\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n11^4 = 11 \\times 11 \\times 11 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 11 = 121 \\\\\n121 \\times 11 = 1,331 \\\\\n1,331 \\times 11 = 14,641\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\therefore \\text{Total sequences} = 14,641\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait a second, let me double-check that calculation:\n\n- \\( 11 \\times 11 = 121 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\( 121 \\times 11 = 1,331 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\( 1,331 \\times 11 = 14,641 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. The math seems correct.\n\n**First Check:**\n- **Does the answer make sense?** \n  - 14,641 different sequences seems reasonable given the number of students and days.\n  \n**Second Thought:**\n- **Is this the only way to approach it?**\n  - Maybe a tree diagram could confirm this, but mathematically, the permutations with repetition formula seems solid.\n\n### **Step 4: Considering a Tree Diagram Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Visualizing Selections:**\n  - Day 1: 11 possible students\n  - Day 2: 11 possible students\n  - Day 3: 11 possible students\n  - Day 4: 11 possible students\n- **Total Sequences:** Multiply the number of choices each day.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 11 \\times 11 \\times 11 = 11^4 = 14,641\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, this confirms our earlier calculation. The tree diagram approach would visualize it but mathematically leads to the same result.\n\n**Second Check:**\n- **Consistency:** Both methods yield the same answer\u201414,641 sequences.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** The permutations with repetition formula is appropriate since each day's selection is independent and order matters.\n- **Calculation Accuracy:** Checked multiple times; the arithmetic is correct.\n- **Alternative Methods:** The tree diagram, while not necessary, confirms the calculations visually.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe total number of different sequences of crabapple recipients in a week is **14,641**.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **Does the number seem realistic?** Given 11 students and four selection days, 14,641 sequences make sense.\n- **Is there any part of the problem I overlooked?** No, all aspects of the question have been addressed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014starting with permutations with repetition and confirming through a tree diagram approach\u2014I arrived at the total number of sequences: **14,641**. Throughout the process, I reflected, checked my work, and ensured each step logically followed the previous one, leading to a consistent and accurate answer.",
