    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how a human would naturally think through a math problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, here\u2019s what stands out to me:\n\n- **Objective:** Square each integer \\( n \\) from 1 to 10 and find the remainders when these squares are divided by 11. Then, sum all the distinct remainders and determine the quotient when this sum is divided by 11.\n  \n- **Brainstorming:** This reminds me of problems involving moduli and properties of squares. It feels similar to exploring quadratic residues. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to begin.\n\n- **Initial Strategy:** Maybe I could compute the squares directly and then reduce them modulo 11. Alternatively, I could look for patterns or properties of squares modulo 11.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not sure if dealing with all squares directly is the most efficient. Perhaps there's a smarter way by leveraging properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Compute Directly**\n\nAlright, let\u2019s start by computing the squares of each integer from 1 to 10 and then finding their remainders when divided by 11.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1^2 & = 1 \\quad \\text{Remainder } 1 \\\\\n2^2 & = 4 \\quad \\text{Remainder } 4 \\\\\n3^2 & = 9 \\quad \\text{Remainder } 9 \\\\\n4^2 & = 16 \\quad \\text{Remainder } 5 \\, (\\text{since } 16 \\mod 11 = 5) \\\\\n5^2 & = 25 \\quad \\text{Remainder } 3 \\, (\\text{since } 25 \\mod 11 = 3) \\\\\n6^2 & = 36 \\quad \\text{Remainder } 3 \\, (\\text{since } 36 \\mod 11 = 3) \\\\\n7^2 & = 49 \\quad \\text{Remainder } 5 \\, (\\text{since } 49 \\mod 11 = 5) \\\\\n8^2 & = 64 \\quad \\text{Remainder } 9 \\, (\\text{since } 64 \\mod 11 = 9) \\\\\n9^2 & = 81 \\quad \\text{Remainder } 4 \\, (\\text{since } 81 \\mod 11 = 4) \\\\\n10^2 & = 100 \\quad \\text{Remainder } 1 \\, (\\text{since } 100 \\mod 11 = 1) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\n- **Distinct Remainders:** From these calculations, the distinct remainders are \\( 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 \\).\n  \n- **Check:** Wait a minute... I see that some remainders repeat (like 3 and 5). Should I include each remainder only once in the sum? The problem asks for distinct results, so I think summing unique remainders makes sense.\n\n- **Possible Mistake:** Maybe I miscounted the distinct remainders. Let me list them again: \\( 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 \\). Looks correct.\n\n### **Proceeding with the Calculation**\n\nLet\u2019s sum these distinct remainders:\n\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 22\n\\]\n\nNow, find the quotient when this sum is divided by 11:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{22}{11} = 2\n\\]\n\n### **Check the Answer**\n\n- **Intuition Check:** Does \\( m = 22 \\) make sense? Summing up distinct remainders seems logical, and dividing by 11 gives a neat quotient of 2.\n  \n- **Alternative Approach:** I wonder if there's another way to verify this without computing each square individually. Perhaps by using properties of quadratic residues modulo 11?\n\n- **Thinking Out Loud:** If I know that for any prime \\( p \\), the squares modulo \\( p \\) cover certain residues, maybe I can shortcut the calculations.\n\n### **Exploring a Different Strategy: Quadratic Residues Modulo 11**\n\nLet me consider that 11 is a prime number. According to number theory, the squares of integers modulo a prime cover exactly half the possible remainders plus one when zero is included.\n\n- **Possible Remainders:** Since 11 is prime, the possible square remainders are \\( 0, 1, 4, 9, 5, 3 \\) (these correspond to squaring \\( 0 \\) through \\( 10 \\) modulo 11).\n\n- **Applying to Our Range:** However, our range is from 1 to 10, so we exclude 0.\n\n- **Distinct Remainders:** This gives us \\( 1, 4, 5, 9, 3 \\). Wait, but in my original calculation, I got \\( 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 \\). There\u2019s a slight mismatch here.\n\n- **Realization:** Perhaps the order or the inclusion/exclusion is causing the difference. But fundamentally, the set of distinct remainders should align.\n\n### **Finalizing the Calculation**\n\nRegardless of the strategy, both approaches lead me to the same set of distinct remainders: \\( 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 \\).\n\n- **Summing Again:** \\( 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 22 \\)\n\n- **Quotient:** \\( \\frac{22}{11} = 2 \\)\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Correctness:** The sum \\( m = 22 \\) and the quotient when divided by 11 is \\( 2 \\). Everything checks out consistently across different approaches.\n\n- **Reflection:** By exploring both direct computation and leveraging quadratic residue properties, I've verified that the quotient is indeed 2. This reassures me that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough step-by-step exploration, initial brainstorming, strategy testing, and reflective checking, I concluded that the quotient when \\( m \\) (the sum of distinct remainders) is divided by 11 is **2**. Exploring alternative strategies helped confirm the correctness of the solution, ensuring a robust and accurate answer.",

  "ground_truth": "First notice that $(11-n)^2=11^2-2\\cdot 11+n^2\\equiv n^2\\pmod{11}$, and since we're asked to find distinct results, we only need to compute the squares of $n=1,2,3,4,5$. Respectively, $n^2\\equiv 1,4,9,5,3\\pmod{11}$. Thus, $1+4+9+5+3=22=11\\cdot\\boxed{2}$."
