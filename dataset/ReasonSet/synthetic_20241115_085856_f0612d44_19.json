    "working_out": "## **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. When I first look at it, I see that we're dealing with a spherically symmetric, time-independent wave function inside a region between two concentric spheres. The probability of finding the particle in specific radial shells is given, and we need to determine the form of the wave function with respect to the radial distance \\( r \\).\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n\n- **Spherical Symmetry:** Since the wave function is spherically symmetric, it only depends on the radial distance \\( r \\). This simplifies things because we don't need to worry about angular components.\n  \n- **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle in a specific region is related to the square of the wave function's magnitude. Given probabilities in different shells might help us relate the wave function to \\( r \\).\n\n- **Volume of Spherical Shells:** The volume of the regions we're considering differs based on \\( r \\). This might play a role in how the probability is distributed.\n\n- **Possible Forms:** The options provided (\\( 1/r \\), \\( 1/r^2 \\), \\( r \\), \\( r^2 \\)) suggest inverse or direct relationships with \\( r \\). I need to figure out which one aligns with the given probabilities.\n\n**Approaches to Consider:**\n\n1. **Volume Consideration:** Since we have spherical shells, the volume increases with \\( r \\). If the probability is constant across different shells, the wave function might need to compensate for this volume increase.\n\n2. **Normalization of the Wave Function:** The total probability over the entire region must be 1. Checking how each option satisfies this condition could help.\n\n3. **Direct Calculation of Probabilities:** Use the given probabilities to set up equations involving the wave function and solve for its form.\n\nI'll start with the volume consideration approach. If it doesn't lead to a clear answer, I'll try the others.\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Volumes of the Spherical Shells**\n\nGiven:\n- **Inner Sphere Radius:** \\( d_1 \\)\n- **Outer Sphere Radius:** \\( 100 \\times d_1 \\)\n- **Regions of Interest:** \n  - Between \\( d_1 \\) and \\( 2d_1 \\)\n  - Between \\( 2d_1 \\) and \\( 3d_1 \\)\n\n**Calculating Volumes:**\n\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a spherical shell between radii \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (r_2^3 - r_1^3)\n\\]\n\n- **Volume of Shell 1 (\\( d_1 \\) to \\( 2d_1 \\)):**\n\n\\[\nV_1 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi ((2d_1)^3 - (d_1)^3) = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (8d_1^3 - d_1^3) = \\frac{28}{3} \\pi d_1^3\n\\]\n\n- **Volume of Shell 2 (\\( 2d_1 \\) to \\( 3d_1 \\)):**\n\n\\[\nV_2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi ((3d_1)^3 - (2d_1)^3) = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (27d_1^3 - 8d_1^3) = \\frac{76}{3} \\pi d_1^3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe volumes of the two shells are different, yet the probability \\( P \\) of finding the particle in each shell is the same. This suggests that the probability density must vary with \\( r \\) to compensate for the difference in volume. \n\n## **Step 2: Relating Probability to Probability Density**\n\nThe probability \\( P \\) of finding a particle in a region is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = \\int \\psi(r)^2 \\, dV\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\psi(r) \\) is the wave function.\n- \\( dV \\) is the differential volume element.\n\nFor spherical coordinates:\n\n\\[\ndV = 4\\pi r^2 \\, dr\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability in a shell from \\( r_1 \\) to \\( r_2 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\int_{r_1}^{r_2} \\psi(r)^2 \\cdot 4\\pi r^2 \\, dr\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( P \\) is the same for both shells, we can set up the following equations:\n\n1. **For Shell 1 (\\( d_1 \\) to \\( 2d_1 \\)):**\n\n\\[\nP = 4\\pi \\int_{d_1}^{2d_1} \\psi(r)^2 \\cdot r^2 \\, dr \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n2. **For Shell 2 (\\( 2d_1 \\) to \\( 3d_1 \\)):**\n\n\\[\nP = 4\\pi \\int_{2d_1}^{3d_1} \\psi(r)^2 \\cdot r^2 \\, dr \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n## **Step 3: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\nAt this point, I realize I need to express \\( \\psi(r) \\) in terms of \\( r \\) and see which form satisfies both equations. The options are \\( \\psi(r) = 1/r \\), \\( 1/r^2 \\), \\( r \\), or \\( r^2 \\).\n\n**Strategy 1: Assume a General Form for \\( \\psi(r) \\)**\n\nLet's assume:\n\n\\[\n\\psi(r) = A \\cdot f(r)\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( A \\) is a normalization constant and \\( f(r) \\) is one of the given forms (\\( 1/r \\), \\( 1/r^2 \\), \\( r \\), \\( r^2 \\)).\n\n**Strategy 2: Compare Probabilities Directly**\n\nGiven that \\( P \\) is the same for both shells, perhaps setting up a ratio or equating the integrals might help.\n\n**Which Strategy to Use?**\n\nI'll start with Strategy 1 by testing each form of \\( f(r) \\) to see which one satisfies the condition that \\( P \\) is the same for both shells. If this becomes too complicated, I'll consider Strategy 2.\n\n## **Step 4: Testing \\( \\psi(r) = 1/r \\)**\n\nAssume:\n\n\\[\n\\psi(r) = \\frac{A}{r}\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n\\psi(r)^2 = \\frac{A^2}{r^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into Equation 1:\n\n\\[\nP = 4\\pi \\int_{d_1}^{2d_1} \\frac{A^2}{r^2} \\cdot r^2 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 \\int_{d_1}^{2d_1} 1 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 [r]_{d_1}^{2d_1} = 4\\pi A^2 (2d_1 - d_1) = 4\\pi A^2 d_1\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into Equation 2:\n\n\\[\nP = 4\\pi \\int_{2d_1}^{3d_1} \\frac{A^2}{r^2} \\cdot r^2 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 \\int_{2d_1}^{3d_1} 1 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 [r]_{2d_1}^{3d_1} = 4\\pi A^2 (3d_1 - 2d_1) = 4\\pi A^2 d_1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth integrals yield the same probability \\( P = 4\\pi A^2 d_1 \\). This matches the given condition that \\( P \\) is the same for both shells. This suggests that \\( \\psi(r) = 1/r \\) could be the correct form.\n\nBut before concluding, let's test the other options to ensure that this is the only form that satisfies the condition.\n\n## **Step 5: Testing \\( \\psi(r) = 1/r^2 \\)**\n\nAssume:\n\n\\[\n\\psi(r) = \\frac{A}{r^2}\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n\\psi(r)^2 = \\frac{A^2}{r^4}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into Equation 1:\n\n\\[\nP = 4\\pi \\int_{d_1}^{2d_1} \\frac{A^2}{r^4} \\cdot r^2 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 \\int_{d_1}^{2d_1} \\frac{1}{r^2} \\, dr\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 4\\pi A^2 \\left[ -\\frac{1}{r} \\right]_{d_1}^{2d_1} = 4\\pi A^2 \\left( -\\frac{1}{2d_1} + \\frac{1}{d_1} \\right) = 4\\pi A^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{d_1} - \\frac{1}{2d_1} \\right) = 4\\pi A^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2d_1} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{2\\pi A^2}{d_1}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into Equation 2:\n\n\\[\nP = 4\\pi \\int_{2d_1}^{3d_1} \\frac{A^2}{r^4} \\cdot r^2 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 \\int_{2d_1}^{3d_1} \\frac{1}{r^2} \\, dr\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 4\\pi A^2 \\left[ -\\frac{1}{r} \\right]_{2d_1}^{3d_1} = 4\\pi A^2 \\left( -\\frac{1}{3d_1} + \\frac{1}{2d_1} \\right) = 4\\pi A^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2d_1} - \\frac{1}{3d_1} \\right) = 4\\pi A^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{6d_1} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{2\\pi A^2}{3d_1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFor \\( \\psi(r) = 1/r^2 \\), the probabilities \\( P \\) for the two shells are not equal:\n\n- Shell 1: \\( P = \\frac{2\\pi A^2}{d_1} \\)\n- Shell 2: \\( P = \\frac{2\\pi A^2}{3d_1} \\)\n\nSince \\( P \\) should be the same for both shells, \\( \\psi(r) = 1/r^2 \\) does **not** satisfy the given condition. Therefore, this option is **incorrect**.\n\n## **Step 6: Testing \\( \\psi(r) = r \\)**\n\nAssume:\n\n\\[\n\\psi(r) = A \\cdot r\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n\\psi(r)^2 = A^2 \\cdot r^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into Equation 1:\n\n\\[\nP = 4\\pi \\int_{d_1}^{2d_1} A^2 \\cdot r^2 \\cdot r^2 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 \\int_{d_1}^{2d_1} r^4 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 \\left[ \\frac{r^5}{5} \\right]_{d_1}^{2d_1} = \\frac{4\\pi A^2}{5} \\left( (2d_1)^5 - (d_1)^5 \\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{4\\pi A^2}{5} \\left( 32d_1^5 - d_1^5 \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi A^2}{5} \\times 31d_1^5 = \\frac{124\\pi A^2}{5} d_1^5\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into Equation 2:\n\n\\[\nP = 4\\pi \\int_{2d_1}^{3d_1} A^2 \\cdot r^2 \\cdot r^2 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 \\int_{2d_1}^{3d_1} r^4 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 \\left[ \\frac{r^5}{5} \\right]_{2d_1}^{3d_1} = \\frac{4\\pi A^2}{5} \\left( (3d_1)^5 - (2d_1)^5 \\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{4\\pi A^2}{5} \\left( 243d_1^5 - 32d_1^5 \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi A^2}{5} \\times 211d_1^5 = \\frac{844\\pi A^2}{5} d_1^5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFor \\( \\psi(r) = r \\), the probabilities \\( P \\) for the two shells are:\n\n- Shell 1: \\( P = \\frac{124\\pi A^2}{5} d_1^5 \\)\n- Shell 2: \\( P = \\frac{844\\pi A^2}{5} d_1^5 \\)\n\nThese are **not** equal, which contradicts the given condition that \\( P \\) is the same for both shells. Therefore, \\( \\psi(r) = r \\) is **incorrect**.\n\n## **Step 7: Testing \\( \\psi(r) = r^2 \\)**\n\nAssume:\n\n\\[\n\\psi(r) = A \\cdot r^2\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n\\psi(r)^2 = A^2 \\cdot r^4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into Equation 1:\n\n\\[\nP = 4\\pi \\int_{d_1}^{2d_1} A^2 \\cdot r^4 \\cdot r^2 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 \\int_{d_1}^{2d_1} r^6 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 \\left[ \\frac{r^7}{7} \\right]_{d_1}^{2d_1} = \\frac{4\\pi A^2}{7} \\left( (2d_1)^7 - (d_1)^7 \\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{4\\pi A^2}{7} \\left( 128d_1^7 - d_1^7 \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi A^2}{7} \\times 127d_1^7 = \\frac{508\\pi A^2}{7} d_1^7\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into Equation 2:\n\n\\[\nP = 4\\pi \\int_{2d_1}^{3d_1} A^2 \\cdot r^4 \\cdot r^2 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 \\int_{2d_1}^{3d_1} r^6 \\, dr = 4\\pi A^2 \\left[ \\frac{r^7}{7} \\right]_{2d_1}^{3d_1} = \\frac{4\\pi A^2}{7} \\left( (3d_1)^7 - (2d_1)^7 \\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{4\\pi A^2}{7} \\left( 2187d_1^7 - 128d_1^7 \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi A^2}{7} \\times 2059d_1^7 = \\frac{8236\\pi A^2}{7} d_1^7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFor \\( \\psi(r) = r^2 \\), the probabilities \\( P \\) for the two shells are:\n\n- Shell 1: \\( P = \\frac{508\\pi A^2}{7} d_1^7 \\)\n- Shell 2: \\( P = \\frac{8236\\pi A^2}{7} d_1^7 \\)\n\nThese are **not** equal, which contradicts the given condition that \\( P \\) is the same for both shells. Therefore, \\( \\psi(r) = r^2 \\) is **incorrect**.\n\n## **Step 8: Conclusion**\n\nAfter testing all four options:\n\n- **\\( \\psi(r) = 1/r \\):** Both probabilities \\( P \\) are equal for the two shells.\n- **\\( \\psi(r) = 1/r^2 \\):** Probabilities \\( P \\) are not equal.\n- **\\( \\psi(r) = r \\):** Probabilities \\( P \\) are not equal.\n- **\\( \\psi(r) = r^2 \\):** Probabilities \\( P \\) are not equal.\n\nOnly \\( \\psi(r) = 1/r \\) satisfies the condition that the probability \\( P \\) is the same for both shells.\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{r}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection and Verification:**\n\n- **Consistency with Given Probabilities:** The form \\( \\psi(r) = 1/r \\) ensures that the probabilities \\( P \\) are equal in both shells, aligning perfectly with the problem statement.\n\n- **Physical Validity:** The wave function \\( \\psi(r) = 1/r \\) is a well-known form that appears in spherically symmetric problems, such as the hydrogen atom in quantum mechanics. It makes sense that this form would arise in a similar context.\n\n- **Normalization Consideration:** While normalization isn't explicitly required in this problem, \\( \\psi(r) = 1/r \\) can be normalized over the given range to ensure the total probability is 1.\n\n**Thinking Process Recap:**\n\nInitially, I considered the impact of spherical shell volumes on probability distribution, leading me to suspect that the wave function must account for the varying volumes.
