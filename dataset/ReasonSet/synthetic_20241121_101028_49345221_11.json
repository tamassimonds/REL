  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like tackling it on paper, checking my work along the way, and being open to changing strategies if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see the problem asking for \\(\\sin \\angle HAC\\) in a cube \\(ABCDEFGH\\), my initial reaction is:\n\n- **Wait a minute,** this looks like a geometry problem involving a cube. I remember cubes have all sides equal and all angles are right angles. Maybe I can use some basic trigonometry or vector geometry here.\n- **But hold on,** I'm not entirely sure how to visualize \\(\\angle HAC\\). Let me think about which points these are in the cube.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Visualizing the Cube:**\n   - I could try to sketch the cube and locate points \\(H\\), \\(A\\), and \\(C\\) to see what kind of angle we're dealing with.\n   \n2. **Using Coordinates:**\n   - Assign coordinates to each vertex of the cube and then calculate vectors to find the angle.\n   \n3. **Applying Trigonometry:**\n   - Maybe use the Pythagorean theorem or sine definition if I can determine the lengths involved.\n\n4. **Vector Dot Product:**\n   - Another approach could be using the dot product to find the cosine of the angle, and then convert it to sine.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Visualizing the Cube**\n\nLet me start by trying to visualize the cube and locate the points.\n\n- **Hmm...** So, in a cube, each vertex connects to three edges.\n- **Point \\(A\\):** Let's say \\(A\\) is at the origin \\((0,0,0)\\).\n- **Point \\(H\\):** This would be the top vertex directly above \\(D\\).\n- **Point \\(C\\):** This is on the bottom face diagonally across from \\(A\\).\n\nBut honestly, just visualizing isn't giving me a clear picture of the angle HAC. **Maybe I need to assign coordinates to better see the relationships.**\n\n### **Switching to Strategy 2: Using Coordinates**\n\nAlright, let's assign coordinates to the cube's vertices.\n\n- **Let\u2019s assume:**\n  - \\(A = (0, 0, 0)\\)\n  - \\(B = (1, 0, 0)\\)\n  - \\(C = (1, 1, 0)\\)\n  - \\(D = (0, 1, 0)\\)\n  - \\(E = (0, 0, 1)\\)\n  - \\(F = (1, 0, 1)\\)\n  - \\(G = (1, 1, 1)\\)\n  - \\(H = (0, 1, 1)\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This makes sense** because all sides are of length 1, and the cube is aligned with the axes.\n- Now, I can see that \\(A\\), \\(H\\), and \\(C\\) have specific coordinates:\n  - \\(A = (0, 0, 0)\\)\n  - \\(H = (0, 1, 1)\\)\n  - \\(C = (1, 1, 0)\\)\n\n### **Thinking About the Angle HAC**\n\nWith coordinates assigned, I can think of \\(\\angle HAC\\) as the angle between vectors \\(HA\\) and \\(CA\\).\n\n- **Vector \\(HA\\):**\n  - From \\(H\\) to \\(A\\): \\((0 - 0, 0 - 1, 0 - 1) = (0, -1, -1)\\)\n  \n- **Vector \\(CA\\):**\n  - From \\(C\\) to \\(A\\): \\((0 - 1, 0 - 1, 0 - 0) = (-1, -1, 0)\\)\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, these vectors point from \\(H\\) and \\(C\\) towards \\(A\\).\n\n### **Calculating the Sine of the Angle Using Strategy 4: Vector Dot Product**\n\nI remember that the sine of an angle between two vectors can be found using the cross product, but that seems complicated. **Wait, maybe I can simplify this by finding the cosine first using the dot product and then finding the sine.**\n\nBut the problem specifically asks for \\(\\sin \\angle HAC\\), so let's stick with finding sine directly.\n\n#### **Alternative Approach: Using the Cross Product**\n\n- **Cross product \\(HA \\times CA\\):** This gives a vector perpendicular to both \\(HA\\) and \\(CA\\).\n- **Magnitude of the Cross Product:** \\(|HA \\times CA|\\)\n- **Magnitudes of \\(HA\\) and \\(CA\\):** \\(|HA|\\) and \\(|CA|\\)\n- **Sine Definition:**\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta = \\frac{|HA \\times CA|}{|HA| \\cdot |CA|}\n\\]\n\n**Let\u2019s compute these step by step.**\n\n### **Step 1: Compute the Cross Product \\(HA \\times CA\\)**\n\n\\[\nHA = (0, -1, -1), \\quad CA = (-1, -1, 0)\n\\]\n\nUsing the determinant method:\n\n\\[\nHA \\times CA = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n0 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each component:\n\n- **i-component:**\n\n\\[\n(-1)(0) - (-1)(-1) = 0 - 1 = -1\n\\]\n  \n- **j-component:**\n\n\\[\n(0)(0) - (-1)(-1) = 0 - 1 = -1\n\\]\n  \n- **k-component:**\n\n\\[\n(0)(-1) - (-1)(-1) = 0 - 1 = -1\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nHA \\times CA = (-1, -1, -1)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, the cross product results in a vector perpendicular to both \\(HA\\) and \\(CA\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Find the Magnitude of the Cross Product \\(|HA \\times CA|\\)**\n\n\\[\n|HA \\times CA| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) plausible?** Yes, since \\((-1)^2 = 1\\) for each component, adding up to 3.\n\n### **Step 3: Find the Magnitudes of \\(HA\\) and \\(CA\\)**\n\n- **Magnitude of \\(HA\\):**\n\n\\[\n|HA| = \\sqrt{0^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n  \n- **Magnitude of \\(CA\\):**\n\n\\[\n|CA| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) make sense?** Yes, both vectors have lengths of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) since they are diagonals on the cube's faces.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate \\(\\sin \\theta\\)**\n\nUsing the sine formula:\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta = \\frac{|HA \\times CA|}{|HA| \\cdot |CA|} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) a familiar value?** Yes, it corresponds to the sine of 60 degrees, which is plausible in a cube's geometry.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Does this result make sense in the context of a cube?** Cubes have angles of 90 degrees, but here we're dealing with an angle between vectors that aren't aligned along the cube's edges, so \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> \\(\\sin \\angle HAC = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) solution</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy assigning coordinates to the cube's vertices and using vector operations, we successfully calculated \\(\\sin \\angle HAC\\) as \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). Along the way, we explored different strategies, checked our calculations at each step, and ensured the result made sense within the geometric context.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Starting with visualization helped,** but assigning coordinates made the problem more concrete.\n- **Using the cross product** was an effective strategy to directly compute the sine of the angle.\n- **Regular checks** throughout the process ensured that each step was correct and the final answer was valid.\n\n---\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem step by step.
