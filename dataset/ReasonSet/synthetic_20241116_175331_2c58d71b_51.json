I'll make sure to brainstorm various approaches, check my work frequently, and change direction if something doesn't seem right. Here\u2019s how I would naturally tackle this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming the Approach**\n\n**User Query:** Express \\(\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x\\) as a product of trigonometric functions.\n\nWhen I first see this problem, a few thoughts come to mind:\n\n- **Familiar Patterns:** This reminds me of trigonometric identities I've encountered before, especially those involving sums and differences of sines.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - Use the **sum-to-product identities** for sine functions.\n  - Maybe explore **angle addition formulas**, but that seems less relevant here.\n  - Consider **factoring out common terms**, but there don't seem to be common factors immediately visible.\n\nAt this point, the **sum-to-product identities** stand out as the most fitting strategy since we're dealing with the sum of two sine functions. But I'm not entirely sure if this will lead directly to the desired product form, so I need to think it through further.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Sum-to-Product Identities**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSum-to-product identities are trigonometric identities that express the sum (or difference) of two trigonometric functions as a product. For sine functions, the identity is:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A + \\sin B = 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{A + B}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{A - B}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Applying the Identity:**\n\nHere, I can assign:\n- \\(A = 4x\\)\n- \\(B = 6x\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x = 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{4x + 6x}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{4x - 6x}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify this step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Average:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4x + 6x}{2} = \\frac{10x}{2} = 5x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4x - 6x}{2} = \\frac{-2x}{2} = -x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express the Sum as a Product:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\sin 4x + \\sin 6x = 2 \\sin 5x \\cos(-x)\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that can't be right because \\(\\cos(-x) = \\cos x\\) due to the even nature of the cosine function. So, my expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x = 2 \\sin 5x \\cos x\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, according to the sum-to-product identity, this should be correct.\n- **Is there another way to verify?** I could substitute specific values for \\(x\\) to see if both sides agree, but for now, I'll trust the identity.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Angle Addition Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAnother approach could be using angle addition formulas, but looking at the problem again, I realize that these formulas are more suited for products being expressed as sums. Since our goal is to express a sum as a product, this strategy doesn't align well.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this align with the goal?** No, angle addition formulas won't help here.\n- **What does this tell me?** It's better to stick with the sum-to-product identity as it directly addresses the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying the Answer**\n\n**Given Identity:**\n\n\\(\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x = 2 \\sin 5x \\cos x\\)\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\nLet's add \\(\\sin 4x\\) and \\(\\sin 6x\\) using the identity:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x = 2 \\sin 5x \\cos x\n\\]\n\n- **Sample Calculation:** Suppose \\(x = 0\\):\n  - Left Side: \\(\\sin 0 + \\sin 0 = 0\\)\n  - Right Side: \\(2 \\sin 0 \\cos 0 = 0\\)\n  - **Conclusion:** Both sides match.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nThe identity holds true for \\(x = 0\\). While this is a simple check, it suggests that the identity is likely correct. However, to be more confident, I would ideally test with other values or rely on the correctness of the sum-to-product identity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and settling on the sum-to-product identity, I can confidently express the sum of sines as a product:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x = 2 \\sin 5x \\cos x\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Identified sum-to-product identities as the primary approach.\n- **Strategy Exploration:** Considered and dismissed angle addition formulas.\n- **Step-by-Step Application:** Carefully applied the sum-to-product identity, ensuring each calculation was correct.\n- **Reflection and Checking:** Verified the correctness through simple substitutions and consistent logical flow.\n\nThroughout this process, I made sure to reflect often, check my work regularly, and be open to changing strategies when something felt off. This approach not only helped in arriving at the correct solution but also ensured a deeper understanding of the underlying trigonometric principles.",
