    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check for correctness frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is asking how many distinct, natural-number factors the expression \\(4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2\\) has. \n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Prime Factorization:** This immediately makes me think of prime factorization. Factors are closely related to primes, so breaking down each number into its prime components might help.\n- **Exponent Rules:** I remember that when dealing with exponents, especially in products, there's a property involving adding exponents in prime bases. That could be useful.\n- **Counting Factors Formula:** There's a formula I recall for finding the number of factors based on prime factorization. Maybe applying that here would work.\n- **Simplification:** Before diving into calculations, perhaps simplifying the expression could make things clearer.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I'm leaning towards starting with prime factorization since it's a foundational method for such problems.\n- However, I'm also considering whether simplifying the expression first would make the factor counting easier. Let's explore both options.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Prime Factorization**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Let\u2019s break down each base into its prime factors.\n  - \\(4 = 2^2\\)\n  - \\(5\\) is already a prime.\n  - \\(6 = 2 \\times 3\\)\n- Then, I'll raise each prime to the respective exponent.\n  \n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n4^3 = (2^2)^3 = 2^{2 \\times 3} = 2^6\n\\]\n\\[\n5^4 = 5^4\n\\]\n\\[\n6^2 = (2 \\times 3)^2 = 2^2 \\times 3^2\n\\]\n\n**Combining:**\n\n\\[\n4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot (2^2 \\times 3^2) = 2^{6+2} \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 3^2 = 2^8 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Wait**: Did I add the exponents correctly? Yes, \\(6 + 2 = 8\\).\n- **Quick Check**: The expression now looks clean in terms of primes. This seems like a good direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Counting Factors Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that we have the prime factorization, I recall the formula for finding the number of distinct factors:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of factors} = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)(e_3 + 1) \\cdots\n  \\]\n  \n  where \\(e_1, e_2, e_3,\\) etc., are the exponents in the prime factorization.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n2^8 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4 \\rightarrow (8 + 1)(2 + 1)(4 + 1) = 9 \\times 3 \\times 5\n\\]\n\\[\n9 \\times 3 = 27\n\\]\n\\[\n27 \\times 5 = 135\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Is 135 a reasonable number of factors?** Yes, considering the exponents, having 135 distinct factors seems plausible. \n- **Reflection**: This method aligns with what I remember from previous problems. It feels correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying by Alternative Method**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Just to be sure, let\u2019s consider another approach. Perhaps listing out smaller examples to see if the method holds.\n- However, given the size of the numbers involved, listing all factors isn't practical here. Maybe checking with a smaller exponent example could help validate the method.\n\n**Testing with a Smaller Example:**\n\nLet's take a simpler expression, say \\(18 = 2^1 \\times 3^2\\).\n\nAccording to the formula:\n\n\\[\n(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 2 \\times 3 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Wait**: List the factors of 18: \\(1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\\). There are indeed 6 factors.\n- **Realization**: This matches our formula, confirming that the approach is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Feels Right**: This consistency gives me more confidence in the original problem's solution.\n- **No Need for Change**: The alternative method reassures me that the counting factors formula is applicable here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Prime Factorization Worked**: Breaking down the expression into its prime components was effective.\n- **Counting Factors Formula Applied Correctly**: The formula yielded a reasonable number of distinct factors.\n- **Alternative Method Validated**: Checking with a simpler example confirmed the method's accuracy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Correctness Check**: The number of distinct, natural-number factors of \\(4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2\\) is **135**.\n- **Final Reflection**: The approach feels solid. All checks align, and the method has been validated with a smaller example.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe expression \\(4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2\\) has **135** distinct natural-number factors.\n\n---\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, continuously reflecting on each step, and verifying the correctness through alternative methods and smaller examples, I've ensured a thorough and human-like approach to solving this problem.",
