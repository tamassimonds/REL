I'll start by brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each approach, and checking my work along the way to ensure everything adds up.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\nWhen I first look at this problem, I see that Contractor Steve has a job to complete in 30 days. After 6 days, 8 workers have finished \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the job. The goal is to determine the least number of workers needed to complete the job on time.\n\n**What Comes to Mind:**\n- **Time Left:** There are 24 days remaining to complete the job.\n- **Work Completed:** Currently, \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the job is done.\n- **Work Rate:** I need to figure out how much work each person contributes over time.\n\nAt this point, I'm thinking that I need to relate the amount of work completed to the number of workers and the time left. But I'm not entirely sure how to start\u2014maybe calculating the work rate per person per day?\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate the Work Rate:**\n   - Determine how much work one person does in a day.\n   - Use this to figure out how many workers are needed to complete the remaining \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the job in 24 days.\n\n2. **Proportional Approach:**\n   - Since \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the job is done in 6 days, see if scaling up the number of workers proportionally would work.\n\n3. **Work Done Per Day:**\n   - Calculate the total work needed per day and see how it aligns with the current workforce.\n\n**Reflection:**\nCalculating the work rate seems like a solid start. If that gets messy, perhaps the proportional approach can act as a check. But let's try the work rate method first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Work Needed**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo find out how many workers are needed, I should determine the total amount of work required to complete the job. Knowing that \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the job is done by 8 workers in 6 days, I can scale this up to find the total work.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Let\u2019s assume the total work is represented by W.\n- If 8 workers complete \\(\\frac{1}{3}W\\) in 6 days, then the total work \\(W\\) can be calculated as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Work } (W) = \\frac{1}{3}W \\times \\frac{30 \\text{ days}}{6 \\text{ days}} = \\frac{1}{3}W \\times 5 = \\frac{5}{3}W\n  \\]\n  \n**Wait a Minute:**\nThat seems off because multiplying \\(\\frac{1}{3}W\\) by 5 should give the entire work \\(W\\), not \\(\\frac{5}{3}W\\). Let me double-check\u2014misinterpreted here.\n\n**Correction:**\nActually, if \\(\\frac{1}{3}W\\) is completed in 6 days, multiplying this amount by 5 (since \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the total needs to be done over 5 times that period) should give the entire work \\(W\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\nW = \\frac{1}{3}W \\times 5 \\Rightarrow \\frac{5}{3}W = W\n\\]\n\n**Aha Moment:**\nThis suggests that the calculation is circular. It implies that \\(\\frac{5}{3}W = W\\), which can't be correct. I must have set up the equation wrong.\n\n**Realization:**\nPerhaps I need to think differently. Maybe calculating the total work in terms of worker-days (i.e., total number of days all workers work combined) would help.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Total Worker-Days**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nInstead of directly calculating \\(W\\), I'll determine the total number of worker-days needed to complete the job.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Current Work:** 8 workers have completed \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the job in 6 days.\n- **Total Worker-Days So Far:** \\(8 \\text{ workers} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 48 \\text{ worker-days}\\)\n- **Total Worker-Days Required for Full Job:** Since 48 worker-days correspond to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the job, the total worker-days needed for the entire job is:\n  \\[\n  48 \\text{ worker-days} \\times 3 = 144 \\text{ worker-days}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nNow that I know the total work required in terms of worker-days, I can calculate how many workers are needed to complete the remaining work in the available time.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Remaining Work and Time Available**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThere are 24 days left to complete the job. I need to find out how many worker-days are required to finish the remaining \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the job and then determine the number of workers needed.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Remaining Work in Worker-Days:** Since the total work is 144 worker-days and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) is already done, \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) remains:\n  \\[\n  144 \\text{ worker-days} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 96 \\text{ worker-days}\n  \\]\n- **Available Time:** 24 days remaining.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI need to find how many workers can complete 96 worker-days of work in 24 days.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determine Number of Workers Needed**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo find the number of workers required, I'll divide the total remaining worker-days by the number of days left.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Workers} = \\frac{\\text{Total Remaining Worker-Days}}{\\text{Days Left}} = \\frac{96 \\text{ worker-days}}{24 \\text{ days}} = 4 \\text{ workers}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? If 4 workers can complete 96 worker-days in 24 days, that's exactly what's needed to finish the remaining \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the job on time.\n\n**Natural Reflection:**\nGiven that 8 workers were initially completing \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the job in 6 days, reducing the workforce to 4 workers to complete \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the job in 24 days seems proportional and balanced.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Quick Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's quickly verify if this aligns with the overall work distribution and time constraints.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Initial Workforce Contribution:** 8 workers completed \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the job in 6 days.\n- **Total Worker-Days Used:** \\(8 \\text{ workers} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 48 \\text{ worker-days}\\)\n- **Total Worker-Days Needed for Full Job:** 144 worker-days\n- **Remaining Worker-Days Needed:** \\(144 - 48 = 96 \\text{ worker-days}\\)\n- **Days Left to Work:** 24 days\n- **Workers Required:** \\(\\frac{96}{24} = 4\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe numbers check out. Reducing the workforce to 4 workers aligns perfectly with the remaining work and the time available.\n\n**Is This the Final Answer?**\nYes, the calculations consistently point to needing 4 workers to ensure the job is completed on time.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThroughout this process, I started by brainstorming different strategies, initially attempting to calculate the total work needed. When that approach seemed convoluted, I shifted focus to determining the total worker-days required, which provided a clearer path.\n\nBy breaking down the problem into manageable steps\u2014calculating the total work in worker-days, determining the remaining work, and finally, calculating the necessary workforce\u2014I arrived at the solution logically and sequentially.\n\nChecking each step ensured that the solution was correct, confirming that Contractor Steve needs to keep **4 workers** on the job to meet the deadline.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe least number of people Contractor Steve must keep on the job to ensure completion on time is **4 workers**.",

Thus, if Steve keeps all 8 workers, they'll do $4\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}$ of the job in these 24 days. He only needs $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the job done in these 24 days, or half of $\\frac{4}{3}$, so he must keep at least half of his workers: $\\boxed{4}$."
