I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking if I'm on the right track, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how I would naturally think through a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at this question, it involves finding the shortest distance between two circles defined by their equations:\n\n1. \\( x^2 - 10x + y^2 - 4y - 7 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 + 14x + y^2 + 6y + 49 = 0 \\)\n\nMy initial reaction is that this looks like a geometry problem involving circles. I remember dealing with circle equations in the past, specifically converting them to standard form to identify their centers and radii. This might help in determining the distance between the two circles.\n\nAnother approach that comes to mind is calculating the distances between points or using the concept of tangents, but that feels a bit more complex. Let me start by trying to convert the given equations into their standard forms. If that doesn't work, I'll explore other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Convert Circle Equations to Standard Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nConverting the equations to standard form \\( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \\) will help me identify the centers \\((h, k)\\) and radii \\(r\\) of each circle. Knowing the centers and radii is crucial for finding the shortest distance between the circles. \n\nLet me work on the first equation:\n\n**Equation 1:**  \n\\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 - 4y - 7 = 0 \\]\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nI remember that completing the square is a technique used to convert quadratic equations to standard forms. I'll complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms.\n\n**Complete the Square:**\n\nFor \\(x\\)-terms:\n- Take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\): \\(-10 / 2 = -5\\)\n- Square it: \\((-5)^2 = 25\\)\n\nAdd and subtract 25 inside the equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 + y^2 - 4y - 7 = 0 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + y^2 - 4y - 7 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, complete the square for \\(y\\)-terms:\n\nFor \\(y\\)-terms:\n- Take half of the coefficient of \\(y\\): \\(-4 / 2 = -2\\)\n- Square it: \\((-2)^2 = 4\\)\n\nAdd and subtract 4 inside the equation:\n\n\\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y - 2)^2 - 4 - 7 = 0 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 36 = 0 \\]\n\nBring the constant to the other side:\n\n\\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 36 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so the first circle is centered at \\((5, 2)\\) with a radius of \\(6\\) (since \\(r^2 = 36\\)). This seems straightforward. Let me proceed with the second equation.\n\n**Equation 2:**  \n\\[ x^2 + 14x + y^2 + 6y + 49 = 0 \\]\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nI'll use the same method\u2014completing the square\u2014for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms.\n\n**Complete the Square:**\n\nFor \\(x\\)-terms:\n- Take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\): \\(14 / 2 = 7\\)\n- Square it: \\(7^2 = 49\\)\n\nAdd and subtract 49 inside the equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 14x + 49 - 49 + y^2 + 6y + 49 = 0 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ (x + 7)^2 - 49 + y^2 + 6y + 49 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, complete the square for \\(y\\)-terms:\n\nFor \\(y\\)-terms:\n- Take half of the coefficient of \\(y\\): \\(6 / 2 = 3\\)\n- Square it: \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n\nAdd and subtract 9 inside the equation:\n\n\\[ (x + 7)^2 - 49 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + 49 = 0 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ (x + 7)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 = 0 \\]\n\nBring the constant to the other side:\n\n\\[ (x + 7)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 9 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe second circle is centered at \\((-7, -3)\\) with a radius of \\(3\\) (since \\(r^2 = 9\\)). So now I have both circles in standard form:\n\n1. **Circle 1:** \\((x - 5)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 36\\) with center \\(C_1(5, 2)\\) and radius \\(6\\)\n2. **Circle 2:** \\((x + 7)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 9\\) with center \\(C_2(-7, -3)\\) and radius \\(3\\)\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. Now, let's move on to calculating the distance between the centers to see where that leads us.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Distance Between the Centers**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe shortest distance between two circles is the distance between their centers minus their radii. However, first, I need to find the distance between the centers \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\).\n\n**Formula for Distance:**  \nThe distance \\(d\\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\n**Applying to Our Centers:**\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{((-7) - 5)^2 + ((-3) - 2)^2} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(-12)^2 + (-5)^2} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{144 + 25} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{169} \\]\n\n\\[ d = 13 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the distance between the centers \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) is \\(13\\). Now, to find the shortest distance between the two circles, I need to subtract the sum of their radii from this distance.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Find the Shortest Distance Between the Circles**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe shortest distance between two circles is the distance between their centers minus the sum of their radii. Since the sum of the radii will affect whether the circles overlap or not, this step is crucial.\n\n**Sum of Radii:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum of Radii} = r_1 + r_2 = 6 + 3 = 9 \\]\n\n**Applying the Formula:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Shortest Distance} = \\text{Distance Between Centers} - \\text{Sum of Radii} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Shortest Distance} = 13 - 9 = 4 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe shortest distance between the two circles is \\(4\\). This makes sense because the distance between the centers is greater than the sum of the radii, indicating that the circles are separate and do not overlap.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt's always good to double-check the steps to ensure everything aligns logically. Let's reflect on each part:\n\n1. **Conversion to Standard Form:**  \n   - **Circle 1:** \\((x - 5)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 36\\) \u2192 Center \\((5, 2)\\) and radius \\(6\\)\n   - **Circle 2:** \\((x + 7)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 9\\) \u2192 Center \\((-7, -3)\\) and radius \\(3\\)\n\n2. **Distance Between Centers:**  \n   - Calculated as \\(13\\), which is correct.\n\n3. **Sum of Radii:**  \n   - \\(6 + 3 = 9\\), which makes sense given the radii.\n\n4. **Shortest Distance Calculation:**  \n   - \\(13 - 9 = 4\\), aligning with expectations for non-overlapping circles.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nEverything checks out. The approach is logical, and the calculations are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and reflecting on each step, the shortest distance between the two circles is **4** units. By converting the circle equations to standard form, calculating the distance between their centers, and adjusting for their radii, I arrived at this solution.\n\nThroughout the process, I ensured to double-check each part, making adjustments when necessary, and verifying that the final answer aligns with the mathematical principles governing circle geometry.",

  "ground_truth": "We complete the square for the first equation by observing that the first equation is equivalent to \\[\n(x^2-10x +25) +(y^2-4y +4)=36,\n\\] which is also equivalent to \\[\n(x-5)^2 +(y-2)^2 =6^2.\n\\] Similarly, the equation for the second circle is \\[\n(x+7)^2 +(y+3)^2 =3^2.\n\\] Hence, the centers of the circles are $(5,2)$ and $(-7,-3)$, and the radii of the circles are equal to 6 and 3, respectively.  The distance between the points $(5,2)$ and $(-7,-3)$ by the distance formula is $\\sqrt{(5-(-7))^2+(2-(-3))^2}=\\sqrt{12^2+5^2}=\\sqrt{169}=13$.  Therefore, to find the shortest distance between the two circles, we must subtract from $13$ the sum of the radii of the two circles.  Thus, the shortest distance between the circles is $13-3-6 = \\boxed{4}$."
