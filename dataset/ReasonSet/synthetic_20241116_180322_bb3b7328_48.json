    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll tackle it just like I would with any real-world problem, thinking through strategies, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Variables:**\n   - \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers between 100 and 999.\n   - \\( y \\) is the number formed by reversing the digits of \\( x \\).\n   - \\( z = |x - y| \\).\n\n2. **Goal:**\n   - Find how many distinct values \\( z \\) can take.\n\nInitially, this reminds me of problems involving digit manipulation and properties of numbers. But I\u2019m not completely sure how to approach it right away. So, let's brainstorm different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Sample Calculations**\n\nI could pick a few three-digit numbers, reverse their digits, calculate \\( z \\), and see if a pattern emerges. This might help me get a feel for the problem.\n\n**Pros:**  \n- Easy to start with.\n- Provides concrete examples.\n\n**Cons:**  \n- Time-consuming if there are many possible numbers.\n- Might miss some subtle patterns.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Analyze the Relationship Between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)**\n\nAnother approach could be to analyze how reversing the digits affects the value of the number. This might lead to a general formula for \\( z \\).\n\n**Pros:**  \n- Could lead to a more systematic solution.\n- Might reveal deeper mathematical properties.\n\n**Cons:**  \n- Requires a good understanding of number properties.\n- Could get complicated.\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Use Modular Arithmetic or Number Properties**\n\nPerhaps looking at the problem through the lens of modular arithmetic or examining digit positions could help identify possible values of \\( z \\).\n\n**Pros:**  \n- Leveraging mathematical concepts can simplify the problem.\n- Might uncover hidden relationships.\n\n**Cons:**  \n- Could be abstract and hard to visualize initially.\n- Requires familiarity with these concepts.\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards **Strategy 1** to start\u2014picking a few examples to see what's happening. If that doesn't yield clear insights, I'll consider moving to **Strategy 2** or **Strategy 3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Sample Calculations**\n\nLet\u2019s take a few three-digit numbers and calculate \\( z \\).\n\n#### **Example 1:**\n\nLet\u2019s choose \\( x = 123 \\):\n\n- \\( y = 321 \\) (reversing the digits)\n- \\( z = |123 - 321| = | -198 | = 198 \\)\n\nAlright, so \\( z = 198 \\).\n\n#### **Example 2:**\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( x = 456 \\):\n\n- \\( y = 654 \\)\n- \\( z = |456 - 654| = | -198 | = 198 \\)\n\nWait a minute! Both examples give \\( z = 198 \\). This suggests that perhaps there\u2019s a pattern here.\n\n#### **Example 3:**\n\nLet\u2019s pick \\( x = 321 \\):\n\n- \\( y = 123 \\)\n- \\( z = |321 - 123| = |198| = 198 \\)\n\nHmm, this is interesting. Regardless of the number I pick, \\( z \\) seems to be consistently 198. But before jumping to conclusions, I'll test a few more examples.\n\n#### **Example 4:**\n\nLet\u2019s choose \\( x = 274 \\):\n\n- \\( y = 472 \\)\n- \\( z = |274 - 472| = | -198 | = 198 \\)\n\nOkay, again \\( z = 198 \\). This is becoming suspiciously consistent.\n\n#### **Example 5:**\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( x = 803 \\):\n\n- \\( y = 308 \\)\n- \\( z = |803 - 308| = |495| = 495 \\)\n\nWait, now \\( z = 495 \\). This breaks the previous pattern. It seems like not all three-digit numbers yield the same \\( z \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection on Sample Calculations**\n\nAt first, I thought \\( z \\) might always be 198 based on the initial examples. However, the last example shows \\( z = 495 \\). This suggests that the value of \\( z \\) depends on the specific digits of \\( x \\), not on a universal constant.\n\n**Realization:**  \nThere must be something about the digits' positions and their values that determines \\( z \\). The consistency in the earlier examples could be coincidental or limited to certain digit patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing the Difference \\( |x - y| \\)**\n\nSince sample calculations hinted at a pattern but didn't confirm it, let's explore the mathematical properties underlying \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n1. **Express \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in Terms of Their Digits:**\n   \n   Let\u2019s say:\n   - \\( x = 100a + 10b + c \\), where \\( a, b, c \\) are the digits of \\( x \\) (with \\( a \\neq 0 \\) since \\( x \\) is a three-digit number).\n   - \\( y = 100c + 10b + a \\) (reversing the digits).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( z = |x - y| \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   z = |(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a)|\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   z = |100a + 10b + c - 100c - 10b - a|\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   z = |(100a - a) + (10b - 10b) + (c - 100c)|\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   z = |99a - 99c|\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   z = 99 |a - c|\n   \\]\n\n**Insight:**  \nThe value of \\( z \\) is always a multiple of 99, specifically \\( 99 \\times |a - c| \\). This simplifies our problem significantly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining Possible Values of \\( |a - c| \\)**\n\nNow, we need to find all possible values of \\( |a - c| \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits between 1 and 9 (since \\( a \\) can't be 0 in a three-digit number).\n\n1. **Possible Values of \\( |a - c| \\):**\n   - Since both \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits from 0 to 9, and \\( a \\neq c \\), the difference \\( |a - c| \\) can range from 1 to 9.\n\n2. **Multiplying by 99:**\n   - Therefore, \\( z \\) can be \\( 99 \\times 1, 99 \\times 2, \\ldots, 99 \\times 9 \\), or \\( 99, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792, 891 \\).\n\n**Possible Values of \\( z \\):**  \n\\[ 99, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792, 891 \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Check: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Does this make sense?**  \n- **Mathematical Justification:**  \n  - By expressing \\( z \\) in terms of \\( |a - c| \\), we've tied the possible values of \\( z \\) directly to the digits of \\( x \\). Since \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits (1-9), \\( |a - c| \\) must be between 1 and 9.\n  \n- **Sample Calculation Confirmation:**  \n  - Earlier examples like \\( x = 123 \\) and \\( x = 274 \\) yield \\( z = 198 \\) and \\( z = 495 \\), respectively, which match the values derived from \\( 99 \\times |a - c| \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe approach is correct. The possible distinct values of \\( z \\) are indeed multiples of 99, determined by the absolute difference between the first and last digits of \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter systematically exploring different strategies and verifying the calculations, the number of distinct values \\( z \\) can take is **9**. These values are:\n\n\\[ z = 99, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792, 891 \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy starting with sample calculations, I identified a potential pattern, which led to a deeper analysis of the relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) at a digit level. This step-by-step approach helped confirm that \\( z \\) is always a multiple of 99, determined by the difference between the first and last digits of \\( x \\).\n\nOverall, **brainstorming** and **reflecting** throughout the process ensured that even initial misconceptions were corrected, leading to a reliable and systematic solution.",
