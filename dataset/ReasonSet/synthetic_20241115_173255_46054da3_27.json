We're given triangle \\( ABC \\) with:\n\n- \\( BC = 8 \\)\n- The median \\( AD = 5 \\)\n\nWe need to find the largest (\\( M \\)) and smallest (\\( m \\)) possible values of \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\), and then determine \\( M - m \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Median \\( AD \\)**: I remember medians are line segments from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So, \\( D \\) is the midpoint of \\( BC \\).\n- **Given \\( BC = 8 \\)**: This means \\( BD = DC = 4 \\).\n- **Need to find \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\)**: This looks like maximizing and minimizing the sum of squares of the other two sides.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Median Formula:** There's a formula relating the lengths of the sides and medians. Maybe I can use that to express \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\) in terms of known quantities.\n   \n2. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:** Assign coordinates to the points and calculate distances directly. This might be messy but could work.\n\n3. **Law of Cosines or Sines:** These laws relate angles and side lengths, but I'm not directly given angles here.\n\n4. **Geometric Properties:** Perhaps some geometric relationships or inequalities can help, like the triangle inequality or Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\nThe **Median Formula** seems like a good starting point because it directly relates the sides and medians. If that doesn't work, I can explore other methods.\n\n### Step 2: **Exploring the Median Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The formula for the length of a median \\( m_a \\) from vertex \\( A \\) to side \\( BC \\) is:\n  \\[\n  m_a^2 = \\frac{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}{4}\n  \\]\n  where \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) are the lengths of sides \\( AC \\) and \\( AB \\) respectively, and \\( a \\) is the length of side \\( BC \\).\n\n- Rearranging this formula to express \\( b^2 + c^2 \\) in terms of \\( m_a^2 \\) and \\( a^2 \\):\n  \\[\n  b^2 + c^2 = \\frac{4m_a^2 + a^2}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Applying to Our Problem:**\n\nGiven:\n- \\( m_a = 5 \\) (length of median \\( AD \\))\n- \\( a = 8 \\) (length of side \\( BC \\))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\nb^2 + c^2 = \\frac{4(5)^2 + (8)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{4 \\times 25 + 64}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{100 + 64}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{164}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 82\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** This calculation seems straightforward. Let's verify if it aligns with the median formula's logic.\n\n- **Verification:** According to the median formula, \\( b^2 + c^2 \\) should account for both the squares of the median and the side \\( a \\). The arithmetic checks out, so the initial calculation seems correct.\n\n**Interim Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated value of \\( AB^2 + AC^2 = 82 \\). But wait, the problem asks for the largest and smallest possible values. This single calculation doesn't account for variations in \\( AB \\) and \\( AC \\) that maintain the median length as 5. I need to consider different configurations of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\n### Step 3: **Considering Different Triangle Configurations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Idea:** The previous step gave a specific value assuming one particular configuration. However, the problem requests the **largest** and **smallest** possible sums of \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\). This implies there are multiple valid triangles with the same median but different side lengths.\n\n- **Approach:** To find these extrema, I can explore the relationship between the sides and the median. Perhaps using the **Apollonius's Theorem** or considering **extreme cases** (like when \\( AB = AC \\) or when one angle approaches the maximum/minimum).\n\n- **Realization:** I need to ensure that the sum \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\) varies with different angle configurations and isn't fixed at 82.\n\n**Brainstorming Further:**\n\n1. **Apollonius's Theorem:** This theorem relates the sides of a triangle to the length of a median. It might help validate the extremes.\n\n2. **Law of Cosines:** Using the law of cosines to express \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\) in terms of angles and see how to maximize/minimize it.\n\n3. **Geometric Constraints:** Considering the triangle inequality and other geometric constraints to bound \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\).\n\n**Initial Idea:**\n\nLet's start by applying **Apollonius's Theorem** to see if it confirms the median formula result and then explore further for extrema.\n\n### Step 4: **Applying Apollonius's Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Statement:** Apollonius's Theorem states that for any median \\( AD \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\):\n  \\[\n  AB^2 + AC^2 = 2(AD^2 + BD^2)\n  \\]\n  where \\( BD = DC \\) since \\( D \\) is the midpoint of \\( BC \\).\n\n- **Given:**\n  - \\( AD = 5 \\)\n  - \\( BD = DC = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nPlugging into the theorem:\n\\[\nAB^2 + AC^2 = 2(5^2 + 4^2)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2(25 + 16)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2 \\times 41\n\\]\n\\[\n= 82\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** This matches the result from the median formula earlier. However, just like before, this single calculation doesn't account for variations in the triangle's configuration.\n\n- **Realization:** Apollonius's Theorem confirms that for a given median and side midpoint, the sum \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\) is fixed at 82. But the problem asks for the largest and smallest possible values, implying that the triangle can have different configurations affecting this sum.\n\n**Interim Conclusion:**\n\nIt appears that both the Median Formula and Apollonius's Theorem consistently yield \\( AB^2 + AC^2 = 82 \\) for a specific configuration. Yet, the problem's requirement to find extrema suggests that this might not be the full picture.\n\n### Step 5: **Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Conflict:** The consistent result of 82 from both the median formula and Apollonius's theorem seems at odds with the need to find varying extrema for \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\).\n\n- **Possible Oversight:** Perhaps I'm not considering all possible triangle configurations that maintain the median length as 5. It's essential to ensure that all conditions are satisfied and that no geometric constraints are overlooked.\n\n- **Idea:** Maybe introducing coordinates or using an alternative theorem could provide insights into different possible values.\n\n**Rebrainstorming:**\n\n1. **Introduce Coordinates:** Assigning specific coordinates to points in the triangle might help visualize and calculate different side lengths.\n\n2. **Use Law of Cosines:** Relate side lengths through angles to find conditions for maxima and minima.\n\n3. **Geometric Inequalities:** Explore maximum and minimum bounds using inequalities like the Triangle Inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nLet's try using **coordinates** to see if assigning specific points reveals different possible values for \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\).\n\n### Step 6: **Applying Coordinate Geometry**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Idea:** Assign coordinates to vertices \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) to directly calculate \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\) under various configurations.\n\n- **Setup:**\n  - Let\u2019s assume \\( B = (0, 0) \\) and \\( C = (8, 0) \\) since \\( BC = 8 \\).\n  - \\( D \\), the midpoint of \\( BC \\), would be \\( (4, 0) \\).\n  - \\( A = (x, y) \\), unknown coordinates to be determined.\n\n- **Given:** The length of median \\( AD = 5 \\). \n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Express \\( AD \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):**\n   \\[\n   AD = \\sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + y^2} = 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Rightarrow (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 25\n   \\] \n   (Equation 1)\n\n2. **Express \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   AB^2 = x^2 + y^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   AC^2 = (x - 8)^2 + y^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   AB^2 + AC^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (x - 8)^2 + y^2 = 2x^2 - 16x + 64 + 2y^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 2(x^2 + y^2) - 16x + 64\n   \\]\n   \n   But from Equation 1, \\( x^2 + y^2 = 25 + 8x - 16 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   AB^2 + AC^2 = 2(25 + 8x - 16) - 16x + 64\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 2(9 + 8x) - 16x + 64\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 18 + 16x - 16x + 64\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 82\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** This again results in \\( AB^2 + AC^2 = 82 \\). This consistency across different methods suggests that for a given median length and side \\( BC \\), the sum \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\) is indeed fixed at 82, regardless of the triangle's specific shape.\n  \n- **Realization:** It seems that the constraints of the triangle (median length and side \\( BC \\)) uniquely determine \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\) without variation.\n\n**Interim Conclusion:**\n  \nAll approaches converge to \\( AB^2 + AC^2 = 82 \\). This consistency implies that for the given median and side length, the sum \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\) doesn't have varying extrema. Hence, \\( M = m = 82 \\) and thus \\( M - m = 0 \\).\n\n### Step 7: **Final Reflection and Validation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Conflict Resolution:** Initially, the problem seemed to ask for varying extrema, but all methods consistently yield the same value. This suggests that the problem may have been misinterpreted, or perhaps the extrema are inherently constrained by the given lengths.\n\n- **Verification:** To ensure correctness, let's consider the implications:\n  - The median length \\( AD = 5 \\) and side \\( BC = 8 \\) are fixed.\n  - Apollonius's Theorem confirms the relationship between the sides and the median.\n  - Coordinate geometry doesn't introduce any variability.\n  \n- **Insight:** Given these constraints, the sum \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\) must be constant to satisfy the properties of medians in triangles.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nM = m = 82 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad M - m = 0\n\\]\n\n### Final Thoughts:\n\nInitially, I assumed that finding the largest and smallest values for \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\) would involve exploring different triangle configurations. However, through multiple approaches\u2014median formula, Apollonius's theorem, and coordinate geometry\u2014it became clear that the given median and side length uniquely determine the sum \\( AB^2 + AC^2 \\) to be 82. Thus, there are no varying extrema, leading to \\( M - m = 0 \\).",
