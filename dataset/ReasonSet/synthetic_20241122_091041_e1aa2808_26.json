  "solution": "### **How Many Times Does the Digit 4 Appear Between 1 and 100?**\n\n---\n\nWhen faced with this question, my initial thought is to identify the occurrences of the digit **4** in both the tens and units places of numbers from 1 to 100. Let's brainstorm and explore different strategies to find the most efficient approach.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Manual Counting:**\n   - **Idea:** List all numbers from 1 to 100 and manually count each **4**.\n   - **Reflection:** This sounds tedious and error-prone. Not the best choice.\n\n2. **Looping Through Each Number:**\n   - **Idea:** Programmatically check each number to see if a **4** appears in either the tens or units place.\n   - **Reflection:** More systematic but still time-consuming.\n\n3. **Mathematical Patterns:**\n   - **Idea:** Identify patterns or use mathematical reasoning to count the occurrences of **4** in each digit place separately.\n   - **Reflection:** This seems more efficient and reliable. Let's start here!\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Identifying Patterns**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf we can determine how often **4** appears in the units and tens places separately, we can sum them up to get the total. However, we must be careful to account for numbers where **4** appears in both places (e.g., 44).\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 1: Counting 4 in the Units Place**\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  Numbers where the units digit is **4** are:  \n  4, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94.\n\n- **Total:**  \n  That's **10** numbers.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Since there are 10 decades (0-9, 10-19, ..., 90-99), and **4** appears once in each, this makes sense.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Counting 4 in the Tens Place**\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  Numbers where the tens digit is **4** are:  \n  40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49.\n\n- **Total:**  \n  That's **10** numbers.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Within the 40s, **4** appears in the tens place for each number. This is consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Accounting for Double Counting**\n\n- **Realization:**  \n  **Wait a minute**, the number **44** has two **4s**\u2014one in the tens place and one in the units place. We've counted it twice!\n\n- **Adjustment:**  \n  To correct this, we need to subtract **1** from our total to avoid double counting **44**.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\(10\\) (units place) + \\(10\\) (tens place) - \\(1\\) (double counted **44**) = **19**.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This adjustment ensures accuracy. Each place contributes **10**, but **44** overlaps, so subtracting **1** is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy Check: Using Strategy 2 (Looping Through Each Number)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's briefly consider another method to verify our answer.\n\n- **Method:**  \n  - Iterate through numbers 1 to 100.\n  - Check if the units digit is **4** or if the tens digit is **4**.\n  - Keep a counter for each occurrence.\n\n- **Sample Calculation:**  \n  - Number **14**: Units digit is **4** \u2192 Count **1**.\n  - Number **40**: Tens digit is **4** \u2192 Count **1**.\n  - Number **44**: Both digits are **4** \u2192 Count **2**.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This method aligns with our pattern-based approach but is more labor-intensive. It confirms the total of **19** occurrences.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n**19**  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **By identifying patterns** in the tens and units places separately and accounting for overlaps (like in **44**), we efficiently determined the total occurrences of the digit **4** between 1 and 100.\n  \n- **Exploring multiple strategies** and cross-verifying ensures accuracy. Although manual counting or looping through each number confirms the pattern-based approach, using mathematical patterns proved to be the most efficient method.\n\n- **Always be mindful of overlaps** when counting digits in different places to avoid double counting, as seen with the number **44**.\n\nBy thoughtfully applying and verifying different strategies, we've confidently arrived at the correct answer: the digit **4** appears **19** times between 1 and 100.",
