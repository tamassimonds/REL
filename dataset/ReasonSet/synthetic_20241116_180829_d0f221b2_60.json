    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: **Express \\( 0.4\\overline{5} \\) as a common fraction.**\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming:**\n\nWhen I see \\( 0.4\\overline{5} \\), it immediately reminds me of working with repeating decimals. I recall that converting repeating decimals to fractions often involves setting up an equation to capture the repeating part and then algebraically manipulating it to eliminate the repetition.\n\nBut wait, is this decimal similar to \\( 0.\\overline{3} \\), which is a simple repeating decimal? No, this is more complicated because it's a mixed decimal\u2014part of it is non-repeating (\\( 0.4 \\)), and part of it is repeating (\\( \\overline{5} \\)). That adds a layer of complexity.\n\nAnother approach that comes to mind is separating the non-repeating and repeating parts and dealing with them individually. Maybe I can express the non-repeating part as a fraction first and then handle the repeating part using the standard method for repeating decimals.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which method will be the most straightforward, so I'll explore both strategies to see which one works better.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Treating the Decimal as a Mixed Number**\n\n**Step 1:** **Separate the Non-Repeating and Repeating Parts**\n\nFirst, let's think of \\( 0.4\\overline{5} \\) as having two components:\n- A non-repeating part: \\( 0.4 \\)\n- A repeating part: \\( 0.4 + 0.0\\overline{5} \\)\n\nWait, that looks a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider it as:\n- \\( 0.4 \\)\n- Followed by an infinitely repeating \\( 5 \\) after the decimal point.\n\nLooking at it this way, it seems similar to how I would handle mixed numbers with repeating decimals.\n\n**Reflection:** This approach seems logical. By separating the non-repeating and repeating parts, I can deal with each separately and then combine the fractions later.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Let\u2019s start with the non-repeating part:\n\n\\[\n0.4 = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThat seems correct because simplifying \\( \\frac{4}{10} \\) indeed gives \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\n**Step 2:** **Handle the Repeating Decimal**\n\nNow, let's focus on the repeating part: \\( 0.0\\overline{5} \\).\n\nThis reminds me of converting repeating decimals like \\( 0.\\overline{3} \\) into fractions. I'll need to set up an equation to capture the repeating part.\n\nBut wait\u2014before I proceed, I should ensure that treating the \\( 0.0\\overline{5} \\) as a separate decimal makes sense.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAdding \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) to the fraction representing the repeating part should give me the correct fraction for \\( 0.4\\overline{5} \\). Let's see if this method works.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Let\u2019s denote the repeating part as \\( x = 0.0\\overline{5} \\).\n\n\\[\nx = 0.055555\\ldots\n\\]\n\nHmm, this looks familiar. I remember that to convert a repeating decimal to a fraction, I need to eliminate the repeating part by multiplying by a power of 10.\n\n**Step 3:** **Eliminate the Repeating Decimal**\n\nOkay, let's set up an equation to convert \\( x = 0.0\\overline{5} \\) into a fraction.\n\nBut hold on, multiplying by 10 alone won't work here because the repeating part doesn't start immediately after the decimal. I need to consider the position of the repeating digit.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis is a bit tricky because the repeating part starts after one non-repeating digit. I think I need to multiply by 100 to shift the decimal two places, aligning the repeating parts.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Multiply \\( x \\) by 100:\n\n\\[\n100x = 5.55555\\ldots\n\\]\n\n- Now, subtract the original \\( x \\) from this equation:\n\n\\[\n100x - x = 5.55555\\ldots - 0.05555\\ldots \\\\\n99x = 5.5\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** **Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\nAlright, let's solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5.5}{99}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nHmm, before simplifying, let me see if I can convert \\( 5.5 \\) into an improper fraction:\n\n\\[\n5.5 = \\frac{11}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{11}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{99} = \\frac{11}{198}\n\\]\n\nWait a second. That seems like a valid fraction, but let me check if it can be simplified further.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{198} = \\frac{1}{18} \\quad \\text{(since both numerator and denominator are divisible by 11)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSimplifying \\( \\frac{11}{198} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{18} \\) makes sense. So, the repeating part \\( x = 0.0\\overline{5} = \\frac{1}{18} \\).\n\n**Step 5:** **Combine the Non-Repeating and Repeating Parts**\n\nNow, let's add the non-repeating part \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) and the repeating part \\( \\frac{1}{18} \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- First, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 18 is 90.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{36}{90} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{5}{90}\n\\]\n\n- Now, add them together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{90} + \\frac{5}{90} = \\frac{41}{90}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me double-check the addition:\n\n\\[\n36 + 5 = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{41}{90}\n\\]\n\nThat looks correct.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nSo, \\( 0.4\\overline{5} \\) as a common fraction is \\( \\frac{41}{90} \\).\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Using Algebraic Equations Directly**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWhile the first method worked, I realize that there's another approach where I can set up an equation considering the entire decimal at once. Let's explore this alternative strategy to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nInstead of separating the non-repeating and repeating parts, I could set up an equation that captures the decimal's structure directly. This might help verify the correctness of the first method.\n\n**Step 1:** **Set Up the Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s denote \\( x = 0.4\\overline{5} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nTo eliminate the repeating part, I need to multiply by a power of 10 that aligns the repeating digits. Since the repeating part has one digit (\\( 5 \\)), I should multiply by 10.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Multiply \\( x \\) by 10:\n\n\\[\n10x = 4.55555\\ldots\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** **Subtract the Original \\( x \\) from the New Equation**\n\nThis will help eliminate the repeating part:\n\n\\[\n10x - x = 4.55555\\ldots - 0.45555\\ldots \\\\\n9x = 4.1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, to handle the decimal more precisely, I should convert \\( 4.1 \\) into a fraction:\n\n\\[\n4.1 = \\frac{41}{10}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n9x = \\frac{41}{10} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{41}{90}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis matches our previous result. The alternative method confirms that \\( 0.4\\overline{5} = \\frac{41}{90} \\).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBoth strategies lead to the same result: \\( 0.4\\overline{5} = \\frac{41}{90} \\). By exploring different approaches and verifying each step, I've ensured the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nInitially, separating the non-repeating and repeating parts seemed like a logical approach. However, considering the entire decimal at once provided a more straightforward path to the solution. It's always beneficial to brainstorm multiple strategies and verify the results to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with repeating decimals.",
