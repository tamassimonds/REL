  "problem": "Mr. Wong has 10 grandchildren. Assuming that the gender of each child is determined independently and with equal likelihood of male and female, what is the probability that Mr. Wong has more grandsons than granddaughters or more granddaughters than grandsons?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's pull everything together into a cohesive and polished solution while keeping the final answer intact.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nMr. Wong has 10 grandchildren, each with an equal and independent probability of being male or female. We need to find the probability that there are either more grandsons than granddaughters or more granddaughters than grandsons.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nAt first glance, this problem resembles a **binomial distribution** scenario, similar to a series of coin tosses where each toss can land heads or tails. The symmetry of the problem suggests that calculating the probability of having an equal number of grandsons and granddaughters, and then using the complement, might simplify our work.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Binomial Probability Approach:**  \n   Compute probabilities for all cases where the number of grandsons differs from the number of granddaughters.\n\n2. **Complementary Probability Approach:**  \n   Calculate the probability of having an equal number of grandsons and granddaughters, then subtract this from 1 to obtain the desired probability.\n\nGiven the simplicity and efficiency of the **Complementary Probability Approach**, let's proceed with it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Total Number of Outcomes**\n\nEach grandchild can be male (M) or female (F), leading to \\(2^{10}\\) possible combinations of genders.\n\n\\[\n2^{10} = 1,024\n\\]\n\nSo, there are **1,024** total possible gender combinations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Probability of Equal Numbers of Grandsons and Granddaughters**\n\nWe need to find the probability of having exactly 5 grandsons and 5 granddaughters.\n\nThis is a binomial probability problem:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ways} = \\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5! \\times 5!} = 252\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{5 grandsons and 5 granddaughters}) = \\frac{252}{1,024} = \\frac{63}{256}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Desired Probability Using Complement**\n\nTo find the probability of having either more grandsons or more granddaughters, subtract the probability of equal numbers from 1:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{more grandsons or more granddaughters}) &= 1 - P(\\text{equal numbers}) \\\\\n&= 1 - \\frac{63}{256} \\\\\n&= \\frac{256 - 63}{256} \\\\\n&= \\frac{193}{256}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's briefly consider an alternative method:\n\n- **Calculate Probability of More Grandsons:**  \n  Sum the probabilities of having 6 to 10 grandsons.\n  \n- **Symmetry:**  \n  The probability of more granddaughters is identical.\n\nHowever, adding these probabilities directly confirms that using the complement is more straightforward and avoids overcounting. Thus, the complementary approach remains valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{more grandsons or more granddaughters}) = \\frac{193}{256} \\approx 0.7539 \\text{ or } 75.39\\%\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy calculating the probability of the only scenario where there isn't a majority (i.e., equal numbers of grandsons and granddaughters) and subtracting it from 1, we efficiently determined that the probability of having more grandsons than granddaughters or vice versa is \\(\\frac{193}{256}\\), approximately 75.39%.\n\nThis approach leverages the symmetry and simplicity inherent in the problem, ensuring an accurate and elegant solution.",
  "ground_truth": "We could do this with a bit of casework, but that gets boring after a while. Instead, we can use complementary probability -- we'll find the probability that Mr. Wong has exactly the same number of grandsons as granddaughters, and then subtract this from 1. Since each grandchild can be male or female with equal likelihood, there are $2^{10}=1024$ possible ways in which the genders of the grandchildren can be determined. The only way in which Mr. Wong won't have more grandsons than granddaughters or more granddaughters than grandsons is if he has exactly 5 of each, which can occur in $\\binom{10}{5}$ ways, since there are $\\binom{10}{5}$ ways to choose 5 of the 10 children to be boys (the others then are girls).  Therefore, the probability that Mr. Wong has the same number of grandsons and granddaughters is  $$\\dfrac{\\binom{10}{5}}{2^{10}} = \\frac{252}{1024} = \\frac{63}{256}.$$\n\n\nSince the probability that he has the same number of granddaughters and grandsons is $\\frac{63}{256}$, the probability he doesn't have the same number of granddaughters and grandsons is $1-\\frac{63}{256} = \\boxed{\\frac{193}{256}}$."
