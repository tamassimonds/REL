    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through each stage just like how I'd naturally approach it. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to ensure I'm on the right track, and check my work frequently to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem: \n\n**Rationalize the denominator of \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}}\\)**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks familiar. I recall that rationalizing denominators is often done by multiplying by some form of unity to eliminate roots in the denominator. But wait, this involves cube roots, not square roots like I'm more used to. \n\n- **Memory Jog:** Maybe I can use something similar to the difference of squares, but with cube roots? I remember that multiplying by conjugates helps with square roots, but cube roots might need a different approach.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Multiply by the Conjugate:** This is my go-to for square roots. But for cube roots, I'm not sure if that will work directly.\n  2. **Use the Sum and Difference of Cubes Formula:** This might be applicable since we're dealing with cube roots.\n  3. **Express in Terms of Rational Numbers:** Perhaps try to express the roots in a way that simplifies when multiplied.\n\n- **Exploring the First Strategy:**  \nLet's start by trying to multiply by something that resembles a conjugate. Maybe if I multiply the numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}\\), it might help, similar to how square roots work.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Multiply by a Conjugate**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI recall that for square roots, multiplying by the conjugate eliminates the square root in the denominator. I wonder if a similar idea can be applied here with cube roots.\n\n**Action:**  \nMultiply numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}}{\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Numerator:**  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2} = \\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{6} + \\sqrt[3]{4}\n  \\]\n\n- **Denominator:**  \n  Using the identity \\((a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = a^3 - b^3\\):\n  \n  \\[\n  (\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2})(\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}) = 3 - 2 = 1\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, the denominator simplifies to 1. That means the fraction reduces to the numerator itself. So, our initial multiplying approach was correct but perhaps too straightforward. Let's see if this aligns with what the question asks.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf the denominator simplifies to 1, the fraction becomes just the numerator. But the question asks for the answer in the form \\(\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{A} + \\sqrt[3]{B} + \\sqrt[3]{C}}{D}\\). Our numerator is already in that form, but we need to ensure it matches.\n\n**Action:**  \nExpress the numerator in the desired format and identify \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{6} + \\sqrt[3]{4}}{1}\n\\]\n\nSo,  \n- \\(A = 9\\)  \n- \\(B = 6\\)  \n- \\(C = 4\\)  \n- \\(D = 1\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, this looks good. Each term in the numerator corresponds nicely to the required form, and the denominator simplifies to 1, which fits perfectly. But let me double-check that the sum \\(A + B + C + D\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\(A + B + C + D\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe're asked to find \\(A + B + C + D\\). Let's plug in the values we identified from the numerator.\n\n**Action:**  \nCalculate:\n\n\\[\nA + B + C + D = 9 + 6 + 4 + 1\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n9 + 6 = 15  \n15 + 4 = 19  \n19 + 1 = 20\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe sum is 20. This seems reasonable. I don't see any inconsistencies, and the earlier steps align with this result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that multiplying by the conjugate (or an equivalent) indeed rationalized the denominator and that no steps were skipped.\n\n**Action:**  \nRe-examine each step:\n\n- **Step 1:** Multiplying by \\(\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}\\) simplified the denominator to 1 through the identity related to cubes.\n- **Step 2:** The numerator was correctly formatted to match the required expression.\n- **Step 3:** The sum \\(A + B + C + D\\) was computed accurately.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The approach was correct, and the final answer makes sense. If I had noticed any discrepancies, I would've re-evaluated the steps or considered alternative strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Concluding the Solution**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{20}\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBy rationalizing the denominator using an appropriate conjugate for cube roots, we simplified the fraction to its lowest terms. The components \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) were correctly identified, leading to the sum \\(A + B + C + D = 20\\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nThis approach effectively addressed the problem by leveraging the identity related to cube roots. Throughout the process, checking and reflecting ensured accuracy, and recognizing that the denominator simplified to 1 was key to arriving at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Brainstorming:** Started by exploring different strategies, recalling methods for square roots, and considering their applicability to cube roots.\n- **Attempting a Strategy:** Tried multiplying by a conjugate-like expression, which simplified the denominator to 1.\n- **Simplifying and Identifying Components:** Reduced the fraction to its numerator and identified \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\).\n- **Calculating the Sum:** Determined \\(A + B + C + D = 20\\).\n- **Verifying and Reflecting:** Ensured each step was correct and consistent, leading to a confident final answer.\n\nBy approaching the problem thoughtfully and checking each stage, we arrived at the correct solution confidently.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the denominator involves cube roots, we can't just multiply by a conjugate. Instead we use the identity $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. Letting $a = \\sqrt[3]{3}$ and $b = \\sqrt[3]{2}$, we have \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}} \\cdot \\frac{(\\sqrt[3]{3})^2 + \\sqrt[3]{3} \\sqrt[3]{2} + (\\sqrt[3]{2})^2}{(\\sqrt[3]{3})^2 + \\sqrt[3]{3} \\sqrt[3]{2} + (\\sqrt[3]{2})^2}.\n\\]The denominator simplifies by the above identity to $(\\sqrt[3]{3})^3 - (\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 = 1$, so we are left with $\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{6} + \\sqrt[3]{4}$. Matching the form given in the problem, $D = 1$ and $A = 9$, $B = 6$, $C = 4$ (in some order), so $A+B+C+D = \\boxed{20}$."
