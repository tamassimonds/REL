    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it as I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming various strategies, reflecting frequently, and checking my work along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I think:\n- **LCM and GCD Relationship:** There's a well-known relationship between the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Specifically,  \n  \\[\n  LCM(a, b) \\times GCD(a, b) = a \\times b\n  \\]\n- **Given Information:** We know the LCM divided by the GCD equals 33, and one of the integers is 45. I'm trying to recall how this relationship can help.\n- **Goal:** Find the smallest possible value of the other integer.\n\nThis reminds me of problems involving the LCM and GCD relationship, so I think I can leverage that. But let's explore other strategies to be sure.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the LCM and GCD Formula:**\n   \\[\n   LCM(a, b) \\times GCD(a, b) = a \\times b\n   \\]\n   - Given \\( \\frac{LCM(a, b)}{GCD(a, b)} = 33 \\), maybe I can express LCM in terms of GCD and the other number.\n\n2. **Express in Terms of Prime Factors:**\n   - Factor 45 into its prime components and see how that plays into LCM and GCD.\n\n3. **Trial and Error with Possible Multiples/Factors:**\n   - Check multiple integers to see which satisfies both the LCM/GCD condition and the relationship with 45.\n\n4. **Algebraic Equation Setup:**\n   - Set up equations based on the relationship and solve for the unknown integer.\n\nI think starting with the **LCM and GCD relationship** is the most straightforward. If that doesn't lead me directly to the solution, I'll explore the other methods.\n\n### **Step 1: Apply the LCM and GCD Formula**\n\nGiven:\n\\[\n\\frac{LCM(a, b)}{GCD(a, b)} = 33\n\\]\nand\n\\( a = 45 \\)\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( b \\) as the unknown integer\n- \\( GCD(45, b) = g \\)\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\n- If \\( GCD(45, b) = g \\), then \\( 45 \\times b = LCM(45, b)times g \\).\n- From the given condition, \\( \\frac{LCM(45, b)}{g} = 33 \\), so \\( LCM(45, b) = 33g \\).\n- Substitute into the LCM and GCD formula:\n  \\[\n  LCM(45, b)times GCD(45, b) = 45 \\times b\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  33g \\times g = 45 \\times b\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  33g^2 = 45b\n  \\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\n- This equation relates \\( b \\) and \\( g \\). I need to express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( g \\).\n- Maybe I can factor both sides to simplify.\n\n#### **Calculation:**\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\\[\n33g^2 = 45b\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\\[\n11g^2 = 15b\n\\]\n\nRearrange to solve for \\( b \\):\n\\[\nb = \\frac{11g^2}{15}\n\\]\n\n#### **Check:**\n\n- This formula gives \\( b \\) in terms of \\( g \\). To find the smallest possible \\( b \\), I need to find the smallest \\( g \\) that makes \\( b \\) an integer.\n- Since \\( g \\) is the GCD, it must be a divisor of 45.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine Possible Values of \\( g \\)**\n\nGiven \\( GCD(45, b) = g \\), and \\( g \\) must be a divisor of 45, let's list the divisors of 45:\n\\[\n45 = 3^2 \\times 5 \\implies \\text{Divisors: } 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45\n\\]\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\n- I want the smallest \\( b \\), so I should use the smallest possible \\( g \\) that still satisfies the equation \\( b = \\frac{11g^2}{15} \\) being an integer.\n- This means \\( 11g^2 \\) must be divisible by 15.\n\n#### **Checking Each Divisor:**\n\nLet's check each divisor to see which makes \\( b \\) an integer:\n\n1. **\\( g = 1 \\):**\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{11 \\times 1^2}{15} = \\frac{11}{15} \\quad \\text{(not an integer)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **\\( g = 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{11 \\times 3^2}{15} = \\frac{99}{15} = 6.6 \\quad \\text{(not an integer)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **\\( g = 5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{11 \\times 5^2}{15} = \\frac{275}{15} = 18.33 \\quad \\text{(not an integer)}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **\\( g = 9 \\):**\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{11 \\times 9^2}{15} = \\frac{891}{15} = 59.4 \\quad \\text{(not an integer)}\n   \\]\n   \n5. **\\( g = 15 \\):**\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{11 \\times 15^2}{15} = \\frac{2475}{15} = 165 \\quad \\text{(integer)}\n   \\]\n   \n6. **\\( g = 45 \\):**\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{11 \\times 45^2}{15} = \\frac{2475}{15} = 165 \\quad \\text{(same as above)}\n   \\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\n- Only \\( g = 15 \\) and \\( g = 45 \\) make \\( b \\) an integer.\n- Both give \\( b = 165 \\), but since \\( b \\) must be a positive integer and we're looking for the **smallest** possible value, \\( g = 15 \\) leading to \\( b = 165 \\) is the minimal solution.\n\n#### **Check:**\n\n- Dividing \\( 11g^2 \\) by 15 must result in an integer, which only happens when \\( g \\) is a multiple of 3 (since 11 is coprime to 15). Among the divisors of 45, only \\( g = 15 \\) satisfies this condition.\n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that with \\( g = 15 \\) and \\( b = 165 \\), all conditions are satisfied:\n\n- **Calculate LCM and GCD:**\n  - \\( GCD(45, 165) = 15 \\)\n  - \\( LCM(45, 165) = \\frac{45 \\times 165}{15} = 495 \\)\n\n- **Check the Given Condition:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{LCM(45, 165)}{GCD(45, 165)} = \\frac{495}{15} = 33\n  \\]\n  This matches the condition provided in the problem.\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\n- Everything checks out. The relationship between LCM and GCD holds true, and the calculations are consistent.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Express in Terms of Prime Factors**\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see if expressing 45 in its prime factors and applying the LCM and GCD rules would lead to the same solution.\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\n- Prime factorization of 45:  \n  \\[\n  45 = 3^2 \\times 5\n  \\]\n  \n- The LCM involves the highest powers of all prime factors present.\n- The GCD involves the lowest powers of common prime factors.\n\n#### **Calculation:**\n\n- **Express \\( b \\) in Terms of Prime Factors:**\n  - Suppose \\( b = k \\times 45 \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n  - Then, \\( GCD(45, b) = 45 \\) if \\( k \\) includes all prime factors of 45, or a divisor thereof.\n  \n- **Apply the LCM and GCD Relationship:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{LCM(45, b)}{GCD(45, b)} = \\frac{45 \\times b}{GCD(45, b)} = 33\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solve for \\( b \\):**\n  - From previous steps, setting \\( GCD(45, b) = 15 \\) led us to \\( b = 165 \\).\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\n- This alternative approach confirms our initial solution. By considering \\( b \\) as a multiple of 45 and applying the LCM and GCD relationship, we arrive at the same value for \\( b \\).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying through calculations, the smallest possible value of the other integer \\( b \\) is **165**. \n\n- **Initial Approach:** Using the LCM and GCD formula to set up an equation relating \\( b \\) and \\( g \\).\n- **Check:** Ensuring \\( g \\) is a divisor of 45 and finding that only \\( g = 15 \\) yields an integer \\( b \\).\n- **Verification:** Confirming that with \\( g = 15 \\) and \\( b = 165 \\), all given conditions are satisfied.\n- **Alternative Confirmation:** Expressing 45 in prime factors and applying the same relationship corroborates the solution.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\nb = 165\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step process, along with constant reflection and verification, ensures that the solution is accurate and aligns with the problem's requirements.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the other integer, so \\[\\frac{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,n]}{\\gcd(45,n)} = 33.\\]We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, so \\[\\gcd(45,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,n] = 45n.\\]Dividing this equation by the previous equation, we get \\[[\\gcd(45,n)]^2 = \\frac{45n}{33} = \\frac{15n}{11},\\]so $11 [\\gcd(45,n)]^2 = 15n$.\n\nSince 11 divides the left-hand side, 11 also divides the right-hand side, which means $n$ is divisible by 11.  Also, 15 divides the right-hand side, so 15 divides the left-hand side, which means $\\gcd(45,n)$ is divisible by 15.  Since $45 = 3 \\cdot 15$, $n$ is divisible by 15.  Hence, $n$ must be divisible by $11 \\cdot 15 = 165$.\n\nNote that $\\gcd(45,165) = 15$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,165] = 495$, and $495/15 = 33$, so $n=165$ is achievable and the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{165}$."
