    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through as naturally and humanly as possible. I'll start by brainstorming what's going on, explore different strategies, check if I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's make sure to capture every part of the thought process, including reflections, uncertainties, and \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- **First Impressions:** We're dealing with two urns containing balls of different colors. We need to find the probability that a ball drawn from each urn is of the same color. The probability given is \\(0.58\\), and there's a variable \\(N\\) representing the number of blue balls in the second urn.\n  \n- **Familiar Territory:** This reminds me of problems involving probabilities of drawing specific colors from multiple sets. Maybe combining probabilities or using complementary probabilities could work.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:** \n  - Calculate the probability of both balls being green.\n  - Calculate the probability of both balls being blue.\n  - Add these probabilities together since these are mutually exclusive events.\n  - Alternatively, consider the complement probability\u2014probability that the balls are of **different** colors\u2014and subtract from \\(1\\).\n\n**Reflection:** Adding the probabilities of both balls being the same color seems straightforward. Maybe starting with that approach makes sense.\n\n### **Step 2: Listing Known Quantities**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Urn 1:** Contains 4 green and 6 blue balls.\n  - Total: \\(4 + 6 = 10\\) balls.\n  \n- **Urn 2:** Contains 16 green and \\(N\\) blue balls.\n  - Total: \\(16 + N\\) balls.\n\n- **Given Probability:** The probability that both balls are of the same color is \\(0.58\\).\n\n**Check:** Wait, I need to make sure \\(N\\) is a positive integer because we're dealing with physical balls.\n\n**Reflection:** Alright, so \\(N\\) must be a whole number greater than or equal to zero.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Probabilities**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nI\u2019ll calculate the probability of both balls being green and both being blue, then add those probabilities together.\n\n**Probability Both Balls Are Green:**\n\n- **Urn 1:** Probability of drawing a green ball.\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Green from Urn 1}) = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Urn 2:** Probability of drawing a green ball.\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Green from Urn 2}) = \\frac{16}{16 + N}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Combined Probability:**\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Both Green}) = 0.4 \\times \\frac{16}{16 + N}\n  \\]\n\n**Probability Both Balls Are Blue:**\n\n- **Urn 1:** Probability of drawing a blue ball.\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Blue from Urn 1}) = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6\n  \\]\n  \n- **Urn 2:** Probability of drawing a blue ball.\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Blue from Urn 2}) = \\frac{N}{16 + N}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Combined Probability:**\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Both Blue}) = 0.6 \\times \\frac{N}{16 + N}\n  \\]\n\n**Total Probability Both Balls Are the Same Color:**\n\\[\nP(\\text{Same Color}) = P(\\text{Both Green}) + P(\\text{Both Blue}) = 0.4 \\times \\frac{16}{16 + N} + 0.6 \\times \\frac{N}{16 + N}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This looks right so far. We're considering both scenarios where the balls are the same color and adding their probabilities.\n\n### **Step 4: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Given:**\n\n\\[\n0.4 \\times \\frac{16}{16 + N} + 0.6 \\times \\frac{N}{16 + N} = 0.58\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Simplify the Equation:** The common denominator is \\(16 + N\\), so we can factor it out.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.4 \\times 16 + 0.6 \\times N}{16 + N} = 0.58\n\\]\n\n- **Multiply Both Sides by \\(16 + N\\) to Clear the Denominator:**\n\\[\n0.4 \\times 16 + 0.6 \\times N = 0.58 \\times (16 + N)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Let\u2019s calculate \\(0.4 \\times 16\\) first to keep things straightforward.\n\n### **Step 5: Performing Calculations**\n\n**Calculating \\(0.4 \\times 16\\):**\n\\[\n0.4 \\times 16 = 6.4\n\\]\n\n**Updating the Equation:**\n\\[\n6.4 + 0.6N = 0.58 \\times (16 + N)\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(0.58 \\times 16\\):**\n\\[\n0.58 \\times 16 = 9.28\n\\]\n\n**Expanding the Right Side:**\n\\[\n6.4 + 0.6N = 9.28 + 0.58N\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** I see that both sides have an \\(N\\) term. Let's isolate \\(N\\) by moving all \\(N\\) terms to one side.\n\n### **Step 6: Isolating the Variable \\(N\\)**\n\n**Rearranging the Equation:**\n\\[\n6.4 + 0.6N - 0.58N = 9.28\n\\]\n\\[\n6.4 + 0.02N = 9.28\n\\]\n\n**Subtracting 6.4 from Both Sides:**\n\\[\n0.02N = 9.28 - 6.4 = 2.88\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(N\\):**\n\\[\nN = \\frac{2.88}{0.02} = 144\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a moment\u2014144 blue balls? That seems like a lot compared to the 16 green balls. Let me double-check the calculations to ensure everything is correct.\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying the Calculation**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Step 6 Summary:**\n  \\[\n  0.02N = 2.88 \\implies N = 144\n  \\]\n\n- **Does It Make Sense?** Having 144 blue balls alongside 16 green balls in the second urn is a possible scenario, especially since \\(N\\) is a positive integer.\n\n- **Alternative Check:** Let's substitute \\(N = 144\\) back into the original probability equation to see if it holds true.\n\n**Substituting \\(N = 144\\):**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Same Color}) = 0.4 \\times \\frac{16}{16 + 144} + 0.6 \\times \\frac{144}{16 + 144}\n\\]\n\nCalculating Each Part:\n\n- **First Term:**\n  \\[\n  0.4 \\times \\frac{16}{160} = 0.4 \\times 0.1 = 0.04\n  \\]\n\n- **Second Term:**\n  \\[\n  0.6 \\times \\frac{144}{160} = 0.6 \\times 0.9 = 0.54\n  \\]\n\n- **Total:**\n  \\[\n  0.04 + 0.54 = 0.58\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** The probabilities add up to \\(0.58\\), which matches the given probability. This confirms that our calculation is correct.\n\n### **Step 8: Concluding the Solution**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{144}\n\\]\n\n**Summary of the Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Brainstorming:** Started by considering different strategies, like adding probabilities for both same-color scenarios and possibly using the complementary approach.\n   \n2. **Listing Known Quantities:** Identified the number of balls in each urn and ensured \\(N\\) was a positive integer.\n\n3. **Calculating Probabilities:** Computed the probabilities for both balls being green and both being blue, then combined them.\n\n4. **Setting Up the Equation:** Established an equation based on the given probability.\n\n5. **Performing Calculations:** Solved for \\(N\\), which resulted in \\(144\\).\n\n6. **Verifying the Calculation:** Checked the solution by substituting \\(N\\) back into the probability equation, confirming the correctness.\n\n**Reflection:** Throughout the process, I ensured to check each step for accuracy. Initial doubts about the large value of \\(N\\) were resolved by verifying the calculations, which aligned with the given probability. This step-by-step approach, including constant reflection and verification, led to a reliable solution.\n\n---\n\nBy capturing every part of the thought process, including brainstorming, reflection, and checking work, we've approached the problem as thoughtfully and humanly as possible.",
