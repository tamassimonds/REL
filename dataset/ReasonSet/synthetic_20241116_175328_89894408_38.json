    "working_out": "### Brainstorming and Understanding the Question\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. I've got a right-angled triangle, and the sum of the squares of its three sides is 1800. The goal is to determine the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Right-angled Triangle:** I know that in these triangles, one angle is 90 degrees, and the sides are typically referred to as the two legs and the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is always the longest side and opposite the right angle.\n  \n- **Sum of Squares:** This part jumps out to me because it reminds me of the **Pythagorean theorem**: \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse. But here, we're dealing with the sum of the squares of all three sides, which is different.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Pythagorean Theorem:** Maybe relate it to the theorem, but since all three sides are squared, I might need to think differently.\n  2. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Perhaps set up an equation using the properties of right-angled triangles.\n  3. **Assumptions About Ratios:** Since it's a right-angled triangle, maybe the sides follow specific ratios, like in special triangles (e.g., 45-45-90 or 30-60-90).\n\nAt this point, I'm unsure exactly how to relate the sum of the squares of all three sides to finding just the hypotenuse. But let's proceed by exploring different strategies.\n\n### Exploring Strategy 1: Pythagorean Theorem\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, the Pythagorean theorem only involves the squares of the two legs summing up to the square of the hypotenuse. But here, we're given the sum of the squares of all three sides. This might not directly apply.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Pythagorean theorem alone doesn't help since we have an extra term involving the hypotenuse squared. So, I need to think of another approach.\n\n### Exploring Strategy 2: Setting Up an Equation\n\n**Thought Process:**\nMaybe I can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the sides of the triangle as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ \na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1800 \n\\]\n\nAnd we know from the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[ \na^2 + b^2 = c^2 \n\\]\n\n**Substituting the Second Equation into the First:**\nI can replace \\(a^2 + b^2\\) in the first equation with \\(c^2\\):\n\\[ \nc^2 + c^2 = 1800 \n\\]\n\\[ \n2c^2 = 1800 \n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(c^2\\):**\n\\[ \nc^2 = \\frac{1800}{2} = 900 \n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(c\\):**\n\\[ \nc = \\sqrt{900} = 30 \n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\nDoes this make sense? If the hypotenuse is 30, then:\n\\[ \na^2 + b^2 = c^2 = 900 \n\\]\nAnd the sum of the squares:\n\\[ \na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 900 + 900 = 1800 \n\\]\nThis aligns perfectly with the given condition. So, the hypotenuse length is indeed 30.\n\n### Reflecting and Final Thoughts\n\nInitially, I thought the Pythagorean theorem wouldn't directly apply since the sum of all three sides squared was provided. However, by recognizing that \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), I was able to substitute and solve for \\(c\\).\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Understanding the relationship between the sides in a right-angled triangle is crucial.\n- Substituting known equations can simplify complex problems.\n- Checking each step ensures the solution is correct and consistent with the given data.\n\nIn conclusion, the length of the hypotenuse is **30** units.",

  "ground_truth": "Suppose the side lengths of the triangle are $a$, $b$, and $c$, with $c$ the hypotenuse. Then $c^2 = a^2+b^2$ by the Pythagorean Theorem. We are told that $$a^2+b^2+c^2 = 1800.$$ Since $a^2+b^2=c^2$, then $c^2 + c^2 = 1800$ or $2c^2 = 1800$ or $c^2 = 900$ or $c=30$ (since the side lengths are positive). So the hypotenuse has length $\\boxed{30}$."
