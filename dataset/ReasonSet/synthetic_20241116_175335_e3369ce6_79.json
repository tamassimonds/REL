    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I'd tackle it if I were solving it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like a human would naturally think through a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{4x-16}{3x-4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{4x-16}{3x-4}\\right) = 12\n\\]\n\nmy initial reaction is:\n\n- **This looks like a quadratic equation in disguise.** The expression inside the parentheses is both squared and linear, which hints at a substitution might simplify things.\n  \n- **Substitution could help.** If I let \\( y = \\frac{4x - 16}{3x - 4} \\), the equation transforms into a standard quadratic equation. That sounds promising.\n\n- **But wait, I need to ensure that substitution is valid and doesn't introduce extraneous solutions.** I'll need to check back after solving.\n\n- **Another approach could be solving for \\( x \\) directly, but that might get messy.** Quadratics are typically easier to handle after substitution.\n\nOverall, substituting \\( y = \\frac{4x - 16}{3x - 4} \\) seems like a good starting point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Substitution**\n\nLet's substitute:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{4x - 16}{3x - 4}\n\\]\n\nNow, rewrite the original equation in terms of \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny^2 + y = 12\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\ny^2 + y - 12 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **This looks like a standard quadratic equation.** I can solve this using factoring, the quadratic formula, or completing the square.\n\n- **Factoring might be the quickest.** Let's see if it factors easily.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempt Factoring**\n\nLet's try to factor \\( y^2 + y - 12 = 0 \\).\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to \\(-12\\) and add to \\(1\\):\n\n- \\(-3\\) and \\(4\\) multiply to \\(-12\\) and add to \\(1\\).\n  \nSo, the equation factors as:\n\n\\[\n(y - 3)(y + 4) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **This works out perfectly.** The solution for \\( y \\) are:\n\n  \\[\n  y - 3 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y + 4 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = -4\n  \\]\n\n- **I'll need to substitute back to find \\( x \\).** Both \\( y = 3 \\) and \\( y = -4 \\) should lead to valid \\( x \\) values.\n\n- **But before proceeding, let's consider the domain.** Since \\( y = \\frac{4x - 16}{3x - 4} \\), the denominator cannot be zero. I'll check if \\( 3x - 4 = 0 \\) for these \\( y \\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Check Denominator**\n\nFor \\( y = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x - 16}{3x - 4} = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4x - 16 = 9x - 12 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -5x = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -\\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( y = -4 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x - 16}{3x - 4} = -4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4x - 16 = -12x + 16 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 16x = 32 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 2\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Both values are valid.** Neither makes the denominator zero.\n\n- **Now, let's determine which \\( x \\) is the greatest.** Clearly, \\( x = 2 \\) is greater than \\( x = -\\frac{4}{5} \\).\n\n- **Before finalizing, let's double-check by substituting back into the original equation.** It\u2019s always good to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verification**\n\n**Check \\( x = 2 \\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{4(2) - 16}{3(2) - 4} = \\frac{8 - 16}{6 - 4} = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( y = -4 \\) into the original squared equation:\n\n\\[\n(-4)^2 + (-4) = 16 - 4 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Wait, does this match?**\n\n- **But the original equation was set to 12.** This seems off.\n\n- **Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.** Let's re-examine. But wait, \\( y = -4 \\) was a valid solution from the quadratic equation.\n\n- **Oh! I see the issue.** The original equation is satisfied by \\( y = -4 \\), which corresponds to \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n**Check \\( x = -\\frac{4}{5} \\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{4(-\\frac{4}{5}) - 16}{3(-\\frac{4}{5}) - 4} = \\frac{-\\frac{16}{5} - 16}{-\\frac{12}{5} - 4} = \\frac{-\\frac{96}{5}}{-\\frac{32}{5}} = \\frac{96}{32} = 3\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( y = 3 \\) into the original squared equation:\n\n\\[\n3^2 + 3 = 9 + 3 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Both solutions satisfy the original equation.** I'm glad I checked.\n\n- **This confirms that both \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -\\frac{4}{5} \\) are valid.** However, the problem asks for the greatest possible value of \\( x \\), so \\( x = 2 \\) is the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nThe greatest possible value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the original equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming helped steer me towards substitution,** which simplified the problem significantly.\n\n- **Factoring the quadratic equation was straightforward** and worked well here.\n\n- **Always checking the denominator** was crucial to ensure validity and prevent extraneous solutions.\n\n- **Verifying by substituting back** into the original equation confirmed the correctness of the solution.\n\n- **Reflection throughout the process** ensured that any potential errors were caught early, and the approach was adjusted as needed.\n\nOverall, taking it step by step, reflecting often, and being open to changing strategies led to a correct and confident solution.",
