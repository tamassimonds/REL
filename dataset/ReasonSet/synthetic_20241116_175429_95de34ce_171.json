    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. \n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + 2y = 4 \\)\n2. \\( xy = -8 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the value of \\( x^2 + 4y^2 \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **This Looks Familiar:** The equation \\( x + 2y = 4 \\) reminds me of linear equations, and \\( xy = -8 \\) involves multiplication. \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - Maybe I can solve for one variable and substitute it into the other equation.\n  - Alternatively, I could use substitution to express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) or vice versa.\n  - Another option is to manipulate the equations to form a quadratic equation, which might link \\( x^2 + 4y^2 \\) directly.\n  - Perhaps expressing \\( x^2 + 4y^2 \\) in terms of \\( (x + 2y)^2 \\) could be useful since we already have that equation.\n\n**Which Strategy to Try First?**\n\nGiven that I have \\( x + 2y = 4 \\), which is already set up to relate to \\( x^2 + 4y^2 \\), I think exploring the squared binomial strategy might be a good start. If that doesn\u2019t work, I can fall back on solving for variables.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Squared Binomial Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** I recall that squaring a binomial \\( (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\). Since I have \\( x + 2y \\), maybe squaring it could relate to \\( x^2 + 4y^2 \\).\n- **Attempting the Strategy:** Let\u2019s square both sides of the equation \\( x + 2y = 4 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(x + 2y)^2 = 4^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting on This Step:**\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** I see \\( y \\) and \\( x \\) multiplied together (\\( 4xy \\)), but I need \\( xy = -8 \\). \n- **Connection:** Maybe I can substitute \\( xy \\) into this equation.\n\n**Checking if This Helps:**\n\nTrying to substitute \\( xy = -8 \\) immediately doesn\u2019t seem to directly help because \\( 4xy = 4(-8) = -32 \\), which complicates things a bit. Instead, perhaps grouping differently could be better.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rearranging the Expanded Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Looking for Patterns:** I have \\( x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 = 16 \\). Since \\( xy = -8 \\), \\( 4xy = -32 \\).\n- **Substituting \\( 4xy \\):**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + (-32) + 4y^2 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4y^2 - 32 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4y^2 = 16 + 32 = 48\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4y^2 = 48\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Let\u2019s See...** This seems straightforward, but let me verify if this approach is correct by cross-checking with another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with Another Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Now, thinking about using substitution to solve for \\( x \\) or \\( y \\) and then find \\( x^2 + 4y^2 \\).\n- **Deciding to Proceed with Verification:** Since the first method gave a clear answer, I\u2019ll check if solving for \\( x \\) or \\( y \\) leads to the same result.\n\n**Attempting to Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\nFrom \\( x + 2y = 4 \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 4 - 2y\n\\]\n\n**Substituting into \\( xy = -8 \\):**\n\n\\[\n(4 - 2y)y = -8\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4y - 2y^2 = -8\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2y^2 - 4y - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 2y - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\( y \\) using the Quadratic Formula:**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-4)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\n**Finding Corresponding \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = 4 - 2(1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}) = 4 - 2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5} = 2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\( x^2 + 4y^2 \\):**\n\nLet\u2019s pick \\( y = 1 + \\sqrt{5} \\) and \\( x = 2 - 2\\sqrt{5} \\) (but both should lead to the same \\( x^2 + 4y^2 \\)):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = (2 - 2\\sqrt{5})^2 = 4 - 8\\sqrt{5} + 20 = 24 - 8\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny^2 = (1 + \\sqrt{5})^2 = 1 + 2\\sqrt{5} + 5 = 6 + 2\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4y^2 = 4(6 + 2\\sqrt{5}) = 24 + 8\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4y^2 = (24 - 8\\sqrt{5}) + (24 + 8\\sqrt{5}) = 48\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Consistency:**\n\n- **Matching the Earlier Result:** This matches our earlier result from the squared binomial approach.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Both Methods Agree:** Both strategies converge to \\( x^2 + 4y^2 = 48 \\), which confirms the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Verification**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does \\( xy = -8 \\) Hold?**\n  - \\( x = 2 - 2\\sqrt{5} \\)\n  - \\( y = 1 + \\sqrt{5} \\)\n  \n  Multiplying them:\n\n  \\[\n  xy = (2 - 2\\sqrt{5})(1 + \\sqrt{5}) = 2 + 2\\sqrt{5} - 2\\sqrt{5} - 10 = 2 - 10 = -8\n  \\]\n\n  **Conclusion:** Yes, \\( xy = -8 \\) is satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4y^2 = \\boxed{48}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Approach Validation:** Starting with the squared binomial method was effective because it directly related to the expression we needed to find. When verifying with substitution, both methods yielded the same result, reinforcing the correctness.\n- **Possible Mistakes and Corrections:** Initially, I considered substituting \\( xy = -8 \\) directly into the squared equation but realized clearing \\( 4xy \\) simplified the process.\n- **Learning Point:** Exploring multiple strategies ensured accuracy and provided a deeper understanding of the relationship between the given equations.\n\n---\n\n**Closing Thoughts:**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies and verifying through multiple methods, I confidently arrived at the solution. Reflection throughout the process helped identify and correct paths, ensuring the answer was both accurate and well-understood.",
