    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it step by step, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and reflecting on whether each approach makes sense. Let's see where this journey takes us.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see that:\n\n- \\( f(x) \\) is a linear function.\n- It satisfies the equation \\( f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \\).\n- I'm given that \\( f(1) = 4 \\).\n- I need to find \\( f(2) \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Linear Function Insight:** Since \\( f(x) \\) is linear, it can be expressed in the form \\( f(x) = ax + b \\). This might be helpful to find the coefficients.\n  \n- **Inverse Function Relationship:** The equation involves the inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\). This makes me think about how functions and their inverses relate. Perhaps I can use properties of inverses to set up an equation.\n\n- **Given Point:** Knowing \\( f(1) = 4 \\) provides a specific point on the function, which can help in determining \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n- **Solving for \\( f(2) \\):** Once I have \\( f(x) \\) explicitly, finding \\( f(2) \\) should be straightforward.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Express \\( f(x) \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):** Use the linear function form and the given point to set up equations.\n   \n2. **Utilize the Inverse Function Property:** Set up an equation using the given functional equation and solve for \\( f(x) \\).\n\n3. **Substitute Known Values:** Since \\( f(1) = 4 \\), maybe substitute \\( x = 1 \\) in the given equation to find more information.\n\n**Reflection:** I think starting by expressing \\( f(x) \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) could be a good starting point. If that gets complicated, I can switch strategies.\n\n### **Step 1: Expressing \\( f(x) \\) in Terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)**\n\nAssume \\( f(x) = ax + b \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since \\( f(x) \\) is linear, this is the standard form.\n- I know \\( f(1) = 4 \\), so I can set up an equation to find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven:  \n\\[ f(1) = a(1) + b = 4 \\]  \nSo,  \n\\[ a + b = 4 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis gives me one equation with two unknowns. I'll need another equation to determine both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n### **Step 2: Utilizing the Functional Equation**\n\nThe given equation is:  \n\\[ f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I have \\( f(x) = ax + b \\), but I need to express \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n- To find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), I can set \\( y = f(x) \\) and solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Find the Inverse Function:**  \n   Given \\( y = ax + b \\), solve for \\( x \\):  \n   \\[\n   y = ax + b \\implies ax = y - b \\implies x = \\frac{y - b}{a} \\implies f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x - b}{a}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) into the Given Equation:**  \n   \\[\n   f(x) = 4 \\left( \\frac{x - b}{a} \\right) + 6\n   \\]  \n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   f(x) = \\frac{4(x - b)}{a} + 6 = \\frac{4x - 4b}{a} + 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set \\( f(x) \\) Equal to the Expression Above:**  \n   From Step 1, \\( f(x) = ax + b \\). Therefore:  \n   \\[\n   ax + b = \\frac{4x - 4b}{a} + 6\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis is a bit messy, but I can see that both sides represent \\( f(x) \\). Maybe I can simplify and solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nLet's make the equation easier to work with.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \\( a \\) (assuming \\( a \\neq 0 \\)).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( a \\):  \n\\[\na(ax + b) = 4(x - b) + 6a\n\\]  \nSimplifying:  \n\\[\na^2x + ab = 4x - 4b + 6a\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow I have a polynomial equation in \\( x \\). I notice that the coefficients of \\( x \\) on both sides should be equal, and the constant terms should also match.\n\n### **Step 4: Equating Coefficients**\n\nTo find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), set coefficients of \\( x \\) and constant terms equal.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Coefficients of \\( x \\): \\( a^2 = 4 \\)\n- Constant terms: \\( ab = -4b + 6a \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **From \\( a^2 = 4 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   a = 2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a = -2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute \\( a \\) into the Constant Terms Equation:**  \n   \\[\n   ab = -4b + 6a\n   \\]\n   Let's solve for \\( b \\) using both possible values of \\( a \\).\n\n**Case 1:** \\( a = 2 \\)  \n\\[\n2b = -4b + 12 \\implies 6b = 12 \\implies b = 2\n\\]\n\n**Case 2:** \\( a = -2 \\)  \n\\[\n(-2)b = -4b - 12 \\implies 2b = -12 \\implies b = -6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI have two possible sets of coefficients:  \n- \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 2 \\)\n- \\( a = -2 \\), \\( b = -6 \\)\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying with the Given Point**\n\nI know \\( f(1) = 4 \\). Let's use this to determine which set of coefficients is correct.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Plug \\( x = 1 \\) into both sets and see which one satisfies \\( f(1) = 4 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **For \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 2 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   f(1) = 2(1) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 \\quad \\text{(Matches the given point)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **For \\( a = -2 \\), \\( b = -6 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   f(1) = -2(1) - 6 = -2 - 6 = -8 \\quad \\text{(Doesn't match the given point)}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOnly \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\) satisfy the given point \\( f(1) = 4 \\). Thus, the correct coefficients are \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\).\n\n### **Step 6: Writing the Linear Function**\n\nNow that I have \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), I can write \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(x) = 2x + 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks straightforward and matches the given point. But let's double-check by seeing if it satisfies the original functional equation.\n\n### **Step 7: Checking the Original Functional Equation**\n\nThe original equation is:  \n\\[ f(x) = 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Verify if \\( f(x) = 2x + 2 \\) satisfies this equation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\):**  \n   Already found earlier:  \n   \\[\n   f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x - 2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compute \\( 4f^{-1}(x) + 6 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   4f^{-1}(x) + 6 = 4 \\left( \\frac{x - 2}{2} \\right) + 6 = 2(x - 2) + 6 = 2x - 4 + 6 = 2x + 2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compare with \\( f(x) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   f(x) = 2x + 2\n   \\]  \n   Both sides are equal.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe function \\( f(x) = 2x + 2 \\) satisfies the original functional equation. This confirms that our coefficients are correct.\n\n### **Step 8: Finding \\( f(2) \\)**\n\nNow, to find \\( f(2) \\), simply plug \\( x = 2 \\) into \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(2) = 2(2) + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe value \\( f(2) = 6 \\) makes sense given the linear function we've determined. It aligns with the pattern established by \\( f(1) = 4 \\).\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let's quickly review:\n\n- **Given:** \\( f(1) = 4 \\).\n- **Determined:** \\( f(x) = 2x + 2 \\).\n- **Computed:** \\( f(2) = 6 \\).\n- **Verified:** The function satisfies the original functional equation.\n\nEverything checks out. The solution is consistent and aligns with all given conditions.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming, exploring different strategies, and verifying each step, I've determined that:\n\n\\[\nf(2) = 6\n\\]\n\nBy expressing the linear function, utilizing the inverse property, and confirming with the given point, I ensured the solution is accurate and complete. This step-by-step approach, along with regular reflections and checks, led to the correct answer.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $f(x)$ is a linear function, we can write $f(x) = ax + b$.  We want to find the inverse function $g(x)$ defined by $f(g(x))=x$ for every $x$.  If we substitute $g(x)$ into the equation for $f$ we get  \\[f(g(x))=ag(x)+b.\\]Using that the left side is $f(g(x))=x$ we get \\[x=ag(x)+b.\\]Solving for $g$ we obtain \\[g(x)=\\dfrac{x-b}{a}.\\]Substituting $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ into the given equation, we get \\[ax + b = 4 \\cdot \\frac{x-b}{a} + 6\\]Multiplying both sides by $a$, we get \\[a^2 x + ab = 4x - 4b + 6a.\\]For this equation to hold for $\\emph{all}$ values of $x$, we must have the coefficient of $x$ on both sides equal, and the two constant terms equal. Setting the coefficients of $x$ equal gives $a^2 = 4$, so $a = \\pm2$. Setting constant terms equal gives $ab = -4b + 6a$. If $a = 2$, we have $2b = -4b + 12$, which gives $b = 2$. If $a = -2$, we have $-2b = -4b - 12$, so $b = -6$. Thus we have two possibilities: $f(x) =2x + 2$ or $f(x) = -2x - 6$.\n\nWe're given that $f(1) = 4$, and testing this shows that the first function is the correct choice. So finally, $f(2) = 2(2) + 2 = \\boxed{6}$."
