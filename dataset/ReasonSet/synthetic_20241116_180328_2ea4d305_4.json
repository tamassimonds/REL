    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just as I would if I were tackling it myself. I\u2019ll brainstorm, explore different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let\u2019s see where this takes us!\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts**\n\nLooking at the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Bx - 11}{x^2 - 7x + 10} = \\frac{A}{x - 2} + \\frac{3}{x - 5}\n\\]\n\nI\u2019m immediately reminded of **partial fraction decomposition**. This technique is often used to break down complex rational expressions into simpler ones that are easier to manage, especially when dealing with equations involving fractions set equal to each other.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:**  \n   - This seems like a classic case where you can express the left-hand side as a sum of simpler fractions to match the right-hand side.\n   - But wait, I should check if both sides can be made equivalent in this manner.\n\n2. **Cross Multiplication:**  \n   - Another approach could be to cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions and then simplify. \n   - This might lead to a quadratic equation, which could then be solved for the unknowns \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n3. **Factoring the Denominator:**  \n   - Notice that the denominator on the left-hand side, \\( x^2 - 7x + 10 \\), can potentially be factored.\n   - Factoring might make it easier to set up partial fractions or simplify the equation.\n\nI think starting with **factoring the denominator** makes sense because it could lead directly into setting up partial fractions. If that doesn\u2019t work out, I can try cross-multiplication. Let\u2019s proceed step by step.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Factor the Denominator**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThe denominator \\( x^2 - 7x + 10 \\) looks like a quadratic expression that might be factorable. If I can factor it, it\u2019ll help in decomposing the left-hand side into partial fractions.\n\n**Trying to Factor:**\n\nI recognize that:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 7x + 10 = (x - 2)(x - 5)\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet\u2019s expand to check:\n\n\\[\n(x - 2)(x - 5) = x^2 - 5x - 2x + 10 = x^2 - 7x + 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nYes, it factors perfectly. This is a good start because now the left-hand side can potentially be matched with the right-hand side using partial fraction decomposition.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Set Up Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nNow that we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Bx - 11}{(x - 2)(x - 5)} = \\frac{A}{x - 2} + \\frac{3}{x - 5}\n\\]\n\nI can express the left-hand side in terms of the partial fractions on the right-hand side. This looks familiar and seems like a standard approach.\n\n**Rewriting the Left-Hand Side:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Bx - 11}{(x - 2)(x - 5)} = \\frac{A(x - 5) + 3(x - 2)}{(x - 2)(x - 5)}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Right-Hand Side:**\n\n\\[\nA(x - 5) + 3(x - 2) = Ax - 5A + 3x - 6\n\\]\n\\[\n= (A + 3)x - (5A + 6)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOh, I see that by matching the numerators, I can set up equations to solve for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). This makes sense; let's proceed by equating coefficients.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Equate Coefficients**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nFor two fractions to be equal, their numerators must be equal when simplified. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nBx - 11 = (A + 3)x - (5A + 6)\n\\]\n\n**Setting Up Equations:**\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\( x \\):**  \n   \\( B = A + 3 \\)  \n   \n2. **Constant Term:**  \n   \\( -11 = - (5A + 6) \\)  \n   Which simplifies to:  \n   \\( -11 = -5A - 6 \\)   \n   \\( -11 + 6 = -5A \\)   \n   \\( -5 = -5A \\)   \n   \\( A = 1 \\)  \n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me double-check these steps.\n\n- From \\( -11 = -5A - 6 \\):  \n  \\(-11 + 6 = -5A\\)  \n  \\(-5 = -5A\\)  \n  So, \\( A = 1 \\).\n\nThat seems correct.\n\n**Solving for \\( B \\):**\n\nNow, using \\( B = A + 3 \\):\n\n\\[\nB = 1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nBefore moving on, let\u2019s make sure these values make sense.\n\n- Original equation:  \n  \\(\\frac{4x - 11}{(x - 2)(x - 5)} = \\frac{1}{x - 2} + \\frac{3}{x - 5}\\)\n\n- With \\( A = 1 \\) and \\( B = 4 \\), the right-hand side becomes:  \n  \\(\\frac{1}{x - 2} + \\frac{3}{x - 5}\\)\n\n- Left-hand side:  \n  \\(\\frac{4x - 11}{(x - 2)(x - 5)}\\)\n\nThey match, so the values seem correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Calculate \\( A + B \\)**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThe question asks for \\( A + B \\). Since we\u2019ve already determined \\( A = 1 \\) and \\( B = 4 \\), adding them together should give the answer.\n\n\\[\nA + B = 1 + 4 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nLet\u2019s reflect on the entire process to ensure everything aligns.\n\n- **Factoring the Denominator:**  \n  This was a crucial first step that led to setting up the partial fractions correctly.\n\n- **Setting Up Partial Fractions:**  \n  By matching the numerators, I was able to create a system of equations for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n- **Solving for Coefficients:**  \n  Equating coefficients worked smoothly, and the values of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) made sense.\n\n- **Calculating \\( A + B \\):**  \n  Simple addition gave the correct sum.\n\nEverything checks out. The approach was effective, and the solution process was straightforward once the denominator was factored.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nBy factoring the denominator and setting up partial fraction decomposition, I was able to equate coefficients and solve for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). The final answer is:\n\n\\[\nA + B = 5\n\\]\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure to reflect and verify each step, ensuring the solution was correct before proceeding. This methodical approach helped in reaching the correct conclusion confidently.",

  "ground_truth": "We factor the denominator in the left-hand side to get \\[\\frac{Bx - 11}{(x - 2)(x - 5)}= \\frac{A}{x - 2} + \\frac{3}{x - 5}.\\] We then multiply both sides by $(x - 2)(x - 5)$, to get \\[Bx - 11 = A(x - 5) + 3(x - 2).\\] We can solve for $B$ substituting a suitable value of $x$.  For example, setting $x = 5$, the equation becomes $5B - 11 = 9$, so $B = 4$.  Then \\[4x - 11 = A(x - 5) + 3(x - 2).\\] Setting $x = 2$, this equation becomes $-3 = -3A$, so $A = 1$.  Therefore, $A + B = 1 + 4 = \\boxed{5}$."
