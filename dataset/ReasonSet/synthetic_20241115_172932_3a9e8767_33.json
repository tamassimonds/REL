    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle the problem of finding the domain of the expression \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}\\) step by step. I'll begin by brainstorming various strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work often, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how a human would naturally think through a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the expression \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}\\), I notice a few things:\n\n- **Square Roots in the Numerator and Denominator:** The presence of square roots suggests that both the numerator and denominator must be defined and non-negative for real values of \\(x\\). Otherwise, the expression wouldn't make sense.\n\n- **Restrictions on \\(x\\):** To ensure the square roots are defined, \\(x-2\\) and \\(5-x\\) must be non-negative. This immediately points me towards setting up inequalities.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Set Up Inequalities:** Determine where both \\(x-2 \\geq 0\\) and \\(5-x \\geq 0\\).\n  2. **Find the Intersection:** Since both conditions must be true simultaneously, find the overlapping range of \\(x\\).\n  3. **Consider Critical Points:** Check the endpoints and any critical points where the inequalities change.\n\nAt this stage, I feel that setting up and solving these inequalities is the most straightforward approach. But let me jot down my thoughts to ensure I'm on the right track:\n\n- **Initial Approach:** Start by solving \\(x-2 \\geq 0\\) and \\(5-x \\geq 0\\) separately.\n- **Reflection:** Once individual ranges are found, intersect them to find the common domain.\n- **Check for Overlaps:** Ensure that the solution accounts for both conditions being satisfied simultaneously.\n\nThis seems logical, but I'm also aware that it's essential to verify if there's any additional consideration, like excluding points where the denominator might be zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Solving the Inequality \\(x - 2 \\geq 0\\)**\n\nLet's begin by addressing the numerator:\n\n\\[\nx - 2 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nAdding 2 to both sides:\n\n\\[\nx \\geq 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, this means that \\(x\\) should be 2 or greater for the square root in the numerator to be defined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Inequality \\(5 - x \\geq 0\\)**\n\nNow, let's tackle the denominator:\n\n\\[\n5 - x \\geq 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubtracting 5 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-x \\geq -5\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(-1\\) (remember, flipping the inequality sign):\n\n\\[\nx \\leq 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, \\(x\\) needs to be 5 or less for the square root in the denominator to be defined. \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Intersection of the Two Inequalities**\n\nNow, I need to find the values of \\(x\\) that satisfy both conditions simultaneously:\n\n\\[\nx \\geq 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x \\leq 5\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThis can be combined into:\n\n\\[\n2 \\leq x \\leq 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat makes sense! The domain is where both inequalities overlap. So, \\(x\\) must be between 2 and 5, inclusive.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Minimum \\(x\\):** At \\(x = 2\\), \\(\\sqrt{x-2} = \\sqrt{0} = 0\\), which is fine.\n- **Maximum \\(x\\):** At \\(x = 5\\), \\(\\sqrt{5-x} = \\sqrt{0} = 0\\), which is also fine.\n\nBoth endpoints work, so including 2 and 5 is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering the Denominator**\n\nWait a second\u2014it's crucial to ensure that the denominator isn't zero, as division by zero is undefined. Let's double-check:\n\n- **At \\(x = 5\\):** The denominator \\(\\sqrt{5-x} = \\sqrt{0} = 0\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHaving a zero denominator would make the expression undefined. So, even though our initial intersection gave us \\(2 \\leq x \\leq 5\\), we need to exclude \\(x = 5\\) from the domain.\n\n**Update:**\n\nThe corrected domain should be:\n\n\\[\n2 \\leq x < 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis adjustment ensures that the denominator is never zero while still satisfying both original conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Domain**\n\nAfter considering both the numerator and denominator, the domain of the expression is:\n\n\\[\nx \\in [2, 5)\n\\]\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Includes 2:** The numerator is defined at \\(x = 2\\) (numerator becomes 0, denominator is non-zero).\n- **Excludes 5:** The denominator becomes zero at \\(x = 5\\), making the expression undefined.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nBy meticulously checking each step and ensuring both square roots are defined while also considering the denominator's constraints, I've arrived at the correct domain. This process also highlights the importance of verifying each condition to prevent overlooking critical points like the zero denominator.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategies and Verification**\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this and see if the result aligns.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nInstead of solving two separate inequalities, I could consider the expression inside the square roots collectively:\n\n\\(\\sqrt{x-2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{5-x}\\) both being real suggests:\n\n\\[\nx - 2 \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 5 - x \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nThis is essentially what we did by solving individual inequalities. So, this confirms that the initial approach was correct.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does \\(x = 4\\) work?**\n\n  - Numerator: \\(\\sqrt{4-2} = \\sqrt{2}\\), which is defined.\n  - Denominator: \\(\\sqrt{5-4} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\\), which is defined.\n  \n- **Does \\(x = 5\\) work?**\n\n  - Numerator: \\(\\sqrt{5-2} = \\sqrt{3}\\), which is defined.\n  - Denominator: \\(\\sqrt{5-5} = 0\\), so the expression is undefined.\n\nThis confirms that \\(x = 5\\) should indeed be excluded from the domain.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBy exploring an alternative strategy, I reaffirmed the correctness of the initial approach. Always considering multiple methods and verifying the conditions ensures a robust solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming, setting up and solving inequalities, and carefully reflecting on each step, I've determined that the domain of the expression \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{[2, 5)}\n\\]\n\nThis process highlights the importance of thoroughly checking each condition, especially when dealing with square roots and denominators, to ensure a correct and complete solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$."
