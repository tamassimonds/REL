    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it as naturally as possible, sharing my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, and adjusting as needed. Let's tackle it step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts:  \nOkay, we have a sector \\( OAB \\) that's a quarter of a circle with a radius of 3 cm. Inside this sector, there's a circle that's tangent at three points. We need to find the radius of this inscribed circle and express it in the simplest radical form.\n\nInitial reactions:  \nThis reminds me of problems involving inscribed circles (incircles) touching multiple sides or arcs. Since it's a quarter circle, symmetry might play a role here. The circle is tangent to both the radii and the arc, which is interesting.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Geometric Relationships:**  \n   Maybe I can use properties of tangents and circles, like how the distance from the center of the inscribed circle to the sides is equal to its radius.\n\n2. **Coordinate Geometry:**  \n   Assign coordinates to the points and set up equations based on tangency conditions.\n\n3. **Trigonometry:**  \n   Since it's a quarter circle, perhaps angles and right triangles can help.\n\n4. **Similarity:**  \n   Look for similar triangles or other similar figures that can relate the radii.\n\nExploring multiple strategies is essential. If one doesn't work, I can pivot to another.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Geometric Relationships**\n\n**Thought process:**  \nLet's consider that the inscribed circle is tangent to both radii \\( OA \\) and \\( OB \\), and also to the arc \\( AB \\). The center of the inscribed circle should lie along the angle bisector of the sector's angle (which is \\( 45^\\circ \\) since it's a quarter circle).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense because the angle bisector is equidistant from both radii. So, the center of the inscribed circle should be along this bisector.\n\n**Action:**  \n1. **Identify the Angle Bisector:**  \n   The sector's angle is \\( 90^\\circ \\), so the bisector is at \\( 45^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Position of the Center:**  \n   Let's denote the center of the inscribed circle as \\( I \\). It lies on the angle bisector at \\( 45^\\circ \\) from both radii.\n\n3. **Distance from Center \\( O \\) to \\( I \\):**  \n   Let the radius of the inscribed circle be \\( r \\). The distance \\( OI \\) should be \\( R - r \\), where \\( R \\) is the radius of the quarter circle (3 cm).\n\n   But wait... thinking deeper, since the inscribed circle is tangent to the arc as well, the distance from \\( O \\) to \\( I \\) should account for both the radii and the arc.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, this isn't straightforward. Maybe focusing only on the angle bisector isn't enough. I need to consider the tangency to the arc as well.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nPerhaps using coordinate geometry might be more intuitive here. Let's try that.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Coordinate Geometry**\n\n**Thought process:**  \nAssign coordinates to key points and set up equations based on tangency conditions. This can provide a clear algebraic pathway to find \\( r \\).\n\n**Action:**  \n1. **Setting Up Coordinates:**\n\n   - Let's place the center \\( O \\) at the origin: \\( O(0, 0) \\).\n   - Point \\( A \\) is on the negative x-axis: \\( A(-3, 0) \\).\n   - Point \\( B \\) is on the positive y-axis: \\( B(0, 3) \\).\n\n2. **Coordinates of the Center \\( I \\) of the Inscribed Circle:**\n\n   - Since \\( I \\) lies on the \\( 45^\\circ \\) angle bisector, its coordinates can be \\( (x, x) \\) because it makes equal angles with the x and y axes.\n\n3. **Finding the Radius \\( r \\):**\n\n   - The inscribed circle is tangent to both radii \\( OA \\) and \\( OB \\), so the distance from \\( I \\) to either axis should be \\( r \\).\n\n   - Therefore, \\( x = r \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems logical. By setting \\( x = r \\), we simplify the coordinates of \\( I \\) to \\( (r, r) \\).\n\n4. **Equation for Tangency to the Arc:**\n\n   - The inscribed circle is also tangent to the arc \\( AB \\). The distance from the center \\( I \\) to the arc should be \\( R - r \\).\n\n   - But wait... isn't the distance from \\( O \\) to any point on the arc exactly \\( R \\)?\n\n   - So, the distance from \\( O \\) to \\( I \\) should be \\( R - r \\).\n\n   - Calculating \\( OI \\):  \n     \\( OI = \\sqrt{r^2 + r^2} = \\sqrt{2}r \\).\n\n   - Setting up the equation:  \n     \\[ \\sqrt{2}r = 3 - r \\]\n\n**Solving the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2}r + r = 3 \\\\\nr(\\sqrt{2} + 1) = 3 \\\\\nr = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2} + 1}\n\\]\n\n**Rationalizing the Denominator:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2} + 1} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{\\sqrt{2} - 1} \\\\\nr = \\frac{3(\\sqrt{2} - 1)}{2 - 1} \\\\\nr = 3(\\sqrt{2} - 1)\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nr = 3(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis feels correct. The steps flowed logically, and the final expression is in the simplest radical form.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n**Thought process:**  \nBefore finalizing, let's verify if this makes sense geometrically.\n\n1. **Magnitude of \\( r \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\\\\n   \\sqrt{2} - 1 \\approx 0.414 \\\\\n   r \\approx 3 \\times 0.414 \\approx 1.242 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n   - This is less than the radius of the quarter circle (3 cm), which makes sense for an inscribed circle.\n\n2. **Distance \\( OI \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   OI = \\sqrt{2}r \\approx \\sqrt{2} \\times 1.242 \\approx 1.757 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n   - Adding \\( r \\approx 1.242 \\, \\text{cm} \\), we get \\( OI + r \\approx 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\), which matches the original radius.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll calculations check out. The derived radius fits within the geometric constraints of the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and settling on coordinate geometry, we've determined the radius of the inscribed circle to be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\, \\text{cm}}\n\\]\n\nThis approach ensured clarity and correctness by systematically applying geometric and algebraic principles, verifying each step along the way.",

  "ground_truth": "Call the center of the inscribed circle $C$, and let $D$ be the point shared by arc $AB$ and the inscribed circle.  Let $E$ and $F$ be the points where the inscribed circle is tangent to $OA$ and $OB$ respectively.  Since angles $CEO$, $CFO$, and $EOF$ are all right angles, angle $FCE$ is a right angle as well.  Therefore, the measure of angle $DCE$ is $(360-90)/2=135$ degrees.  By symmetry, angles $ECO$ and $FCO$ are congruent, so each measures 45 degrees.  Therefore, angle $DCO$ measures $135+45=180$ degrees, which implies $DC+CO=OD$.  Also, $DC=r$, and $CO=r\\sqrt{2}$, since triangle $CEO$ is an isosceles right triangle.
