  "solution": "Alright, let's put everything together into a smooth, coherent solution while keeping the original answer intact. I'll ensure that the thought process flows naturally, reflecting genuine human thinking, complete with initial reactions, reflections, and adjustments along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this intriguing question:\n\n*If a plane crashes on the border of two countries, where do they bury the survivors?*\n\n---\n\n**First Reaction:**\n\nOkay, this question sounds familiar\u2014kind of like those riddles designed to catch you off guard. At first glance, it seems straightforward, but something feels off. My brain's nudging me, saying, \"Wait a minute, is there a trick here?\"\n\n---\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nHmm, it's asking about the location for burying survivors of a plane crash. But hold on\u2014burying **survivors**? That doesn't quite make sense. Survivors are alive, right? So, why would they need to be buried? I think I need to dig deeper into what the question is really asking.\n\n---\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\nLet's brainstorm a few approaches:\n\n1. **Literal Interpretation:**  \n   - Maybe it's genuinely about deciding where to bury people on a border. But is that practical?\n   \n2. **Logical Analysis:**  \n   - Wait, do survivors even get buried? That seems illogical.\n   \n3. **Riddle Perspective:**  \n   - Perhaps it's meant to be a trick question testing my ability to catch inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGiven that burying survivors doesn't make sense, I'm leaning towards this being a trick question. It's probably testing whether I can spot the flaw in the premise. I think it's time to explore further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me take a closer look...\n\n- **Literal Approach:**  \n  - If I interpret this literally, it's about deciding where to bury people who survived a plane crash. But wait, survivors are alive! So, they wouldn't need burial.\n  \n- **Wait a Minute:**  \n  - This can't be right. Survivors wouldn't need to be buried. Is the question intentionally misleading?\n\n- **Alternative Interpretation:**  \n  - Maybe the question is designed to make me realize the flaw in the premise. It\u2019s likely a test of logical thinking.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, the literal interpretation doesn't work here. Survivors are alive, so burying them is out of the question. I need to think differently\u2014perhaps this is a riddle meant to catch me off guard.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Trick**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIs this a trick question?\n\n- **Aha Moment:**  \n  - Yes! It's definitely a trick question. The key lies in recognizing that survivors wouldn\u2019t be buried because they're still alive.\n\n- **Checking Understanding:**  \n  - Does identifying it as a trick change how I approach the problem? Absolutely. It shifts the focus from geography to logic.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBy spotting the trick, I can see that the intended answer isn't about the location at all\u2014it's about recognizing the inconsistency in the premise. This realization helps me move forward with confidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Validating the New Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s test this idea...\n\n- **Question:**  \n  - If there are survivors, would they need to be buried?\n  \n- **Answer:**  \n  - No, survivors are alive and wouldn\u2019t be buried.\n\n- **Does It Make Sense?**  \n  - Is this consistent with reality? Yes, it is. Survivors are people who made it through the crash, so there's no need for burial.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach seems correct. It aligns with logical thinking and common sense. The question was indeed a trick, and recognizing that helps me arrive at the right answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s put it all together...\n\n- **Putting It All Together:**  \n  - Since survivors aren\u2019t buried, the question\u2019s premise is flawed. The correct answer is that survivors wouldn\u2019t be buried anywhere.\n  \n- **Final Check:**  \n  - Does this answer the question? Yes, it addresses the misleading aspect and provides a clear, logical conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. By recognizing the trick in the question, I've resolved the initial confusion and arrived at the correct answer. It makes perfect sense now.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>**\n\nSurvivors aren't buried anywhere because they are alive. The question is a trick meant to test logical thinking.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nLet's wrap it up...\n\n- **Initial Confusion:**  \n  - The question seems straightforward but contains a logical flaw by asking where to bury survivors.\n\n- **Strategic Exploration:**  \n  - Considered literal and logical interpretations.  \n  - Recognized it as a trick question.\n\n- **Validation:**  \n  - Confirmed that survivors don\u2019t require burial.\n\n- **Final Answer:**  \n  - Clearly stated that the premise is incorrect and provided the logical conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, reflecting at each stage, and being open to changing strategies, I was able to arrive at the correct answer. The key was in recognizing the inconsistency in the question's premise and adjusting my thinking accordingly. This process not only led me to the right conclusion but also enhanced my problem-solving skills by challenging me to think critically and creatively.",
