First, I'll read the question carefully to understand what's being asked:\n\n**Question:**  \nWhen the product \\((3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5)\\) is expanded, what is the sum of the coefficients of the terms which contain a nonzero power of \\(y\\)?\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \n- **Understanding the Problem:** I need to expand the given expression and identify all terms containing \\(y\\). Then, I'll sum up the coefficients of those terms.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Direct Expansion:** Use the distributive property (FOIL method) to expand the product step by step.\n  2. **Identify Relevant Terms:** Focus only on the terms that will produce \\(y\\) during expansion to save time.\n  3. **Coefficient Analysis:** After expansion, ensure that only coefficients associated with \\(y\\) are included in the sum.\n\nI think starting with the **Direct Expansion** method would be straightforward. If it seems too lengthy, I can switch to focusing only on relevant terms.\n\n## **Step 1: Direct Expansion Using the Distributive Property**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI'll expand \\((3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5)\\) by distributing each term in the first bracket over each term in the second bracket. This is essentially applying the distributive property multiple times.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Expand Each Term:**\n\n   - First, distribute \\(3x\\):\n     \\[\n     3x \\cdot x + 3x \\cdot 4y + 3x \\cdot 5\n     \\]\n   \n   - Next, distribute \\(2y\\):\n     \\[\n     2y \\cdot x + 2y \\cdot 4y + 2y \\cdot 5\n     \\]\n   \n   - Finally, distribute \\(1\\):\n     \\[\n     1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot 4y + 1 \\cdot 5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Write Out All Terms:**\n   \\[\n   3x^2 + 12xy + 15x + 2yx + 8y^2 + 10y + x + 4y + 5\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, I notice that \\(2yx\\) is equivalent to \\(2xy\\). It's better to write it consistently as \\(2xy\\) to combine like terms later. \n\n**Rewriting Terms:**\n   \\[\n   3x^2 + 12xy + 15x + 2xy + 8y^2 + 10y + x + 4y + 5\n   \\]\n\n## **Step 2: Combine Like Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I'll combine the like terms to simplify the expression. This will help me easily identify the coefficients of terms containing \\(y\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Combine \\(xy\\) Terms:**\n   \\[\n   12xy + 2xy = 14xy\n   \\]\n\n2. **Combine \\(x\\) Terms:**\n   \\[\n   15x + x = 16x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine \\(y\\) Terms:**\n   \\[\n   10y + 4y = 14y\n   \\]\n\n4. **Write the Simplified Expression:**\n   \\[\n   3x^2 + 14xy + 8y^2 + 16x + 14y + 5\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks correct. I've combined all like terms, and the expression is neatly simplified. Now, I can easily identify the terms containing \\(y\\).\n\n## **Step 3: Identify Terms with Nonzero Powers of \\(y\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI need to pick out the terms that include \\(y\\) because the problem specifically asks for the sum of their coefficients.\n\n**Identification:**\n\n- \\(14xy\\): Coefficient is \\(14\\)\n- \\(8y^2\\): Coefficient is \\(8\\)\n- \\(14y\\): Coefficient is \\(14\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThese are all the terms that contain \\(y\\). The coefficients are straightforward to identify.\n\n## **Step 4: Sum the Coefficients of the \\(y\\) Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI'll add up the coefficients of the identified \\(y\\) terms to find the final answer.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n14 + 8 + 14 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAdding these coefficients gives me \\(36\\). It seems reasonable given the coefficients I extracted. \n\n## **Step 5: Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing the answer, it's good practice to double-check the work to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Review Each Step:**\n   - **Expansion:** All terms were correctly expanded.\n   - **Combining Like Terms:** Correctly combined \\(xy\\), \\(x\\), and \\(y\\) terms.\n   - **Coefficient Identification:** Accurately picked out coefficients associated with \\(y\\).\n\n2. **Alternative Strategy Check:**  \n   - Initially considered focusing only on terms that would produce \\(y\\) during expansion, but the direct expansion method worked efficiently without being too cumbersome.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. No errors were found upon reviewing each step. \n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe sum of the coefficients of the terms which contain a nonzero power of \\(y\\) is **36**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBy systematically expanding the expression, combining like terms, and carefully identifying the relevant coefficients, I arrived at the correct answer. Taking the time to verify each step ensured accuracy and helped catch any potential mistakes early on.",
