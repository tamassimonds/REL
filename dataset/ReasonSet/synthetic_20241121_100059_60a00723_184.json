  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process step by step, reflecting and checking along the way, just as a human would when tackling a tricky question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, so I need to find the largest value of \\( c \\) such that \\( 1 \\) is within the range of the function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \\). \n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n- This reminds me of problems involving quadratic functions and their ranges.\n- I think I need to ensure that \\( f(x) = 1 \\) has real solutions for some \\( x \\).\n- Maybe I can use the discriminant of the quadratic equation?\n- Alternatively, I could consider the vertex of the parabola since it affects the range.\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, if \\( 1 \\) is in the range, it means there's an \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 1 \\). So, setting \\( f(x) = 1 \\) makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI'll start by setting \\( f(x) = 1 \\) to find when the function equals 1:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x + c = 1\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\nLet me rearrange this to form a standard quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this look right? Yep, I just moved the 1 over to the left side. So far, so good.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Discriminant**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nTo ensure that \\( f(x) = 1 \\) has real solutions, the discriminant (\\(\\Delta\\)) of the quadratic equation should be non-negative. The discriminant for \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\n**Applying to Our Equation:**\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = c - 1 \\). Let's plug these in:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(c - 1) = 25 - 4(c - 1)\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\\[\n\\Delta = 25 - 4c + 4 = 29 - 4c\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nIs this correct? Let me double-check my calculations:\n\n- \\( (-5)^2 = 25 \\)\n- \\( 4 \\times 1 \\times (c - 1) = 4c - 4 \\)\n- So, \\( 25 - 4c + 4 = 29 - 4c \\)\n\nYep, that looks right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Ensuring Real Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nFor the quadratic equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be at least zero:\n\n\\[\n29 - 4c \\geq 0\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( c \\):**\n\\[\n29 \\geq 4c \\implies \\frac{29}{4} \\geq c \\implies c \\leq \\frac{29}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating:**\n\\[\n\\frac{29}{4} = 7.25\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nSo, the largest value of \\( c \\) is 7.25. Does this make sense? Let me think...\n\n- If \\( c = 7.25 \\), then \\( 29 - 4(7.25) = 29 - 29 = 0 \\)\n- A discriminant of 0 means there's exactly one real solution, which is fine for \\( 1 \\) being in the range.\n\nAlright, this seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let me verify by plugging \\( c = 7.25 \\) back into the original function and see if \\( f(x) = 1 \\) has a solution.\n\n**Original Equation:**\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x + 7.25 = 1 \\implies x^2 - 5x + 6.25 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the Discriminant:**\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(6.25) = 25 - 25 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**\nA discriminant of 0 means there's exactly one real solution (a repeated root). This confirms that \\( f(x) = 1 \\) touches the parabola at exactly one point, so \\( 1 \\) is in the range.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis verification supports my earlier conclusion. Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Exploring Vertex Strategy**\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\nWait, what if I approached this differently? I remember that the vertex of a parabola can tell me about its range. Maybe I can use the vertex to double-check my solution.\n\n**Applying the Vertex Formula:**\nThe vertex of a quadratic function \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\) is at:\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{2a}\n\\]\n\n**For Our Function:**\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{-5}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\( f(x) \\) at the Vertex:**\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 - 5 \\times \\frac{5}{2} + c = \\frac{25}{4} - \\frac{25}{2} + c = \\frac{25}{4} - \\frac{50}{4} + c = -\\frac{25}{4} + c\n\\]\n\n**Setting \\( f(x) = 1 \\):**\n\\[\n-\\frac{25}{4} + c = 1 \\implies c = 1 + \\frac{25}{4} = \\frac{29}{4} = 7.25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nInteresting! This alternative approach leads to the same result: \\( c = 7.25 \\). It confirms that the largest value of \\( c \\) is indeed 7.25.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Does the Range Include 1?**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet me make sure that with \\( c = 7.25 \\), the range of \\( f(x) \\) includes \\( 1 \\).\n\n**Considering the Parabola:**\n- The parabola opens upwards (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive).\n- At \\( c = 7.25 \\), \\( f(x) = 1 \\) has exactly one solution, meaning the parabola touches the line \\( y = 1 \\) at one point.\n- Therefore, \\( 1 \\) is in the range.\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything aligns. The discriminant approach and the vertex method both lead to the same conclusion, and the verification supports it.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**<ANSWER>**\nThe largest value of \\( c \\) such that \\( 1 \\) is in the range of \\( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \\) is \\( c = 7.25 \\).\n**</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:** Starting with the discriminant was effective, but exploring the vertex strategy provided additional confirmation.\n- **Verification:** Plugging back the solution helped ensure correctness.\n- **Reflection:** Checking each step prevented errors and validated the approach.\n\nBy thinking through the problem step by step, reflecting, and verifying, I arrived at the correct solution efficiently.",
  "ground_truth": "We see that 1 is in the range of $f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c$ if and only if the equation $x^2 - 5x + c = 1$ has a real root.  We can re-write this equation as $x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0$.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $(-5)^2 - 4(c - 1) = 29 - 4c$.  The quadratic has a real root if and only if the discriminant is nonnegative, so $29 - 4c \\ge 0$.  Then $c \\le 29/4$, so the largest possible value of $c$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{29}{4}}$."
