  "solution": "Absolutely, let's refine the solution to make it clear and concise while preserving the original thought process. I'll keep the final answer unchanged and organize the content to reflect a natural problem-solving approach.\n\n---\n\n# **Complete Solution with Thought Process**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem as if we're working through it step by step, complete with brainstorming, reflecting, checking for correctness, and making adjustments as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Problem Statement:**  \nWe have an infinite geometric series with a common ratio of \\(\\frac{-1}{3}\\) and a sum of 25. Our goal is to find the second term of the sequence.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nHmm, this reminds me of geometric series formulas. I recall there's a formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series. Maybe I can use that to find the terms, but I'm not entirely sure how to connect everything yet. Let\u2019s explore different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series:**  \n   I think the formula is \\(S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\\), where \\(S\\) is the sum, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(r\\) is the common ratio. This seems like a good starting point.\n\n2. **Express the Second Term in Terms of the First Term:**  \n   I know that in a geometric series, each term is the previous term multiplied by the common ratio. So the second term would be \\(a \\times r\\).\n\n3. **Set Up Equations Based on the Given Sum:**  \n   Maybe I can set up an equation using the sum formula to find \\(a\\), and then use that to find the second term.\n\n**Exploration:**  \nLet\u2019s start with the sum formula since we have the total sum and the common ratio. By finding the first term, I can easily get the second term.\n\n---\n\n### **Trying the First Strategy: Using the Sum Formula**\n\n**Step 1: Apply the Sum Formula**\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\[\n25 = \\frac{a}{1 - \\left(\\frac{-1}{3}\\right)}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWait a minute, let me simplify the denominator first. The common ratio is negative, so \\(1 - \\left(\\frac{-1}{3}\\right)\\) should simplify.\n\n\\[\n1 - \\left(\\frac{-1}{3}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n25 = \\frac{a}{\\frac{4}{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:**  \nI need to solve for \\(a\\). I can do this by multiplying both sides by \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) to get rid of the denominator.\n\n\\[\na = 25 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{100}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check the calculation to ensure I didn\u2019t make a mistake.\n\n\\[\n25 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{25 \\times 4}{3} = \\frac{100}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nYep, that looks correct. So the first term \\(a\\) is \\(\\frac{100}{3}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Finding the Second Term**\n\nNow that I have the first term, I can find the second term by multiplying \\(a\\) by the common ratio \\(r\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Second Term} = a \\times r = \\frac{100}{3} \\times \\left(\\frac{-1}{3}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \nLet\u2019s do the multiplication.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100}{3} \\times \\frac{-1}{3} = \\frac{100 \\times (-1)}{3 \\times 3} = \\frac{-100}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAlright, the second term is \\(\\frac{-100}{9}\\). This makes sense because the common ratio is negative, so the terms should alternate in sign.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet me quickly see if this makes sense. The sum of the series is positive (25), and the common ratio is negative, which means the terms alternate in sign. The first term is positive, and the second term is negative, which seems correct.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**  \nDoes the sum formula application hold with these values? Let\u2019s plug back into the sum formula to verify.\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r} = \\frac{\\frac{100}{3}}{1 - \\left(\\frac{-1}{3}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{100}{3}}{\\frac{4}{3}} = 25\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe calculations hold up, so the approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{-100}{9}}\n\\]\n\nThe second term of the sequence is \\(\\frac{-100}{9}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection on the Entire Process**\n\n**Did the Strategy Work?**  \nYes, using the sum formula for an infinite geometric series allowed me to find the first term, which then made it straightforward to calculate the second term.\n\n**Were There Any Mistakes?**  \nI double-checked each step, especially simplifying the denominator and multiplying fractions, to ensure there were no errors.\n\n**Is the Final Answer Reasonable?**  \nGiven the negative common ratio, alternating signs in the terms make sense, and the calculations support the given sum of the series.\n\n**Additional Thoughts:**  \nIf I had encountered any inconsistencies during the check, I would have revisited the sum formula or reconsidered how I applied the common ratio. But since everything aligned, the initial strategy was effective.\n\n---\n\nBy following this thorough, reflective process, we ensured that the solution was correct and accounted for any potential errors along the way.\n\n---\n\nRemember, always verify your steps, especially when dealing with infinite series and negative ratios, to ensure the solution makes sense both mathematically and conceptually.",
  "ground_truth": "The second term seems difficult to calculate directly, so we will first find the value of the first term. Let the first term be $a$.  Because the sum of the series is $25,$ we have  \\[25= \\frac{a}{1-\\left(\\frac{-1}{3}\\right)} = \\frac{a}{\\frac{4}{3}} = \\frac{3a}{4}.\\]Thus, $a=\\frac{100}{3}.$ Now, we can calculate the second term knowing the value of the first. The second term $ar$ is \\[ar=\\left( \\frac{100}{3} \\right)\\left(\\frac{-1}{3}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{-100}{9}} .\\]"
