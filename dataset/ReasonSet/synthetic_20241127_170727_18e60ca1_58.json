  "problem": "How many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in PROBLEM if each letter can be used only once and each sequence must begin with L and not end with P?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this step by step, just like I would if I were tackling this problem on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, it asks for the number of distinct four-letter sequences starting with **L** and not ending with **P**, using letters from **PROBLEM**. Each letter can only be used once. Hmm... this reminds me of permutation problems I've seen before, but with specific constraints.\n\n**Brainstorming Ideas:**\n\n- **Permutations with Constraints:** Maybe I can calculate the total permutations and then subtract the ones that don't meet the criteria.\n- **Direct Counting:** Perhaps it's better to build the sequences step by step, considering the constraints from the start.\n- **Combination of Both:** Use combinations to select letters and then arrange them.\n\nI'm leaning towards **Direct Counting** because it might be more straightforward to incorporate the constraints upfront. But I'll keep the other methods in mind in case this doesn't work.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Constraints**\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\n- The sequence must **begin with L**.\n- It must **not end with P**.\n- Each letter is unique and can be used only once.\n\nSo, out of the seven letters in **PROBLEM**, I'm fixing **L** at the start. That leaves six letters: **P, R, O, B, E, M**.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\nBy fixing **L** at the beginning, I reduce the problem to arranging the remaining letters with the constraint that the sequence does not end with **P**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Total Permutations Without Constraints**\n\n**Initial Approach:**  \n\nLet's see how many total sequences I can make without considering the \"not ending with P\" constraint.\n\n- **First position:** Already fixed as **L**.\n- **Second position:** Any of the remaining 6 letters.\n- **Third position:** Any of the remaining 5 letters.\n- **Fourth position:** Any of the remaining 4 letters.\n\nSo, the total number of unrestricted sequences is:\n\n\\[ \n6 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 120 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\nThis gives me all possible sequences starting with **L**, but some of these will end with **P**, which I need to exclude.\n\n**Check:**  \n\nWait, this only accounts for the positions after **L**. I think I need to consider the sequences that specifically don't end with **P**. Maybe subtracting the unwanted cases is better.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Subtracting Unwanted Cases**\n\n**Revised Approach:**  \n\nLet's calculate the number of sequences that **do** end with **P** and subtract those from the total.\n\n**Calculating Sequences Ending with P:**\n\n- **First position:** Fixed as **L**.\n- **Last position:** Fixed as **P**.\n- **Second position:** Any of the remaining 5 letters.\n- **Third position:** Any of the remaining 4 letters.\n\nSo, the number of sequences ending with **P** is:\n\n\\[ \n5 \\times 4 = 20 \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\nBy subtracting these 20 sequences from the total 120, I'll get the number of sequences that don't end with **P**.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[ \n120 - 20 = 100 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\nThis seems straightforward. But let's think\u2014is there another way to verify this? Maybe using a different method to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Validating with Alternative Method**\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \n\nLet's try constructing the sequences directly by selecting the remaining positions step by step, ensuring the last letter isn't **P**.\n\n**Direct Counting Method:**\n\n1. **First Position:** Fixed as **L**.\n2. **Choose Last Position:** Any letter except **P** (5 choices).\n3. **Choose Second Position:** Any of the remaining 5 letters.\n4. **Choose Third Position:** Any of the remaining 4 letters.\n\n**Total Sequences:**\n\n\\[ \n5 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 100 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\nBoth methods agree\u2014subtracting unwanted cases and direct counting yield the same result. This consistency boosts my confidence in the answer.\n\n**Check:**  \n\nIt seems correct, but let's briefly recap to ensure no steps were missed. By fixing **L** and excluding **P** from the last position, the constraints are satisfied, and the calculations align.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n100 distinct sequences can be made from the letters in **PROBLEM** that start with **L** and do not end with **P**.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis problem initially seemed straightforward, but considering different strategies helped ensure accuracy. Starting with total permutations and then subtracting the unwanted cases provided a clear path. Validating with a direct counting method confirmed the result, enhancing confidence in the solution. Always good to cross-check with multiple approaches to avoid errors.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Brainstorming multiple strategies** helps in selecting the most efficient path.\n- **Reflecting and checking** throughout the process ensures correctness.\n- **Validating with alternative methods** solidifies the final answer.\n\nBy thinking aloud and exploring various approaches, I was able to arrive at the correct solution systematically.",
  "ground_truth": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the fourth letter cannot be P. One way to solve this is to consider the permutations of all 7 letters where the first four satisfy these conditions, and then divide to correct for overcounting. Once we have placed the L, we have 5 options for where to place the P--- any spot except the fourth one, which will become the last one when we remove the last three letters. We can then place the remaining 5 letters without restriction, which there are $5!$ ways to do. This gives us a preliminary count of $5\\times5!=600$. However, no matter what the order of the last three letters, we will still get the same sequence of the first 4 letters; for example, LPROMEB, LPROEBM, and LPROBEM and three other permutations all have the first 4 letters LPRO. Because of this, each sequence of 4 letters has been counted exactly 6 times so our answer is $\\dfrac{5\\times5!}{6}=\\boxed{100}$.\n\nAlternative solution by stevenmeow: There are 5 ways to choose the last letter (B, R, O, M, or E) and the L must go first.  That leaves 5 letters from which to choose the second and third letters, so we can choose the second and third letters in $5\\times 4 = 20$ ways.  This gives us a total of $5\\times 20 = 100$ sequences of letters."
