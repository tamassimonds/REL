  "solution": "### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. We have an **equilateral triangle** with a side length of 12 cm. One side of this triangle serves as the **diameter of a circle**. Inside this setup, there are two small shaded regions whose combined area we need to find in the form \\( a\\pi - b\\sqrt{c} \\). Ultimately, we\u2019ll determine the sum \\( a + b + c \\).\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n- An **equilateral triangle** means all sides are equal, and all angles are \\(60^\\circ\\).\n- Since one side is the diameter of the circle, the circle is inscribed in some way.\n- The shaded regions likely involve parts where the circle and triangle intersect.\n\nI recall dealing with problems involving **segments of circles** and **triangular areas**, so that might be relevant here. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure how these regions look yet.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Visualize the Setup:**\n   - Drawing or imagining the triangle and circle can help.\n   - Identify where the shaded regions are.\n\n2. **Calculate Areas Separately:**\n   - Find the areas of the circle, triangle, and shaded regions individually.\n   - Use subtraction to find the shaded areas.\n\n3. **Use Geometric Properties:**\n   - Leverage properties of equilateral triangles and circles.\n   - Perhaps use **angular measures** to find specific areas.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAt first glance, visualizing the problem seems essential. I might need to sketch it out or at least mentally map it to understand where the shaded regions lie.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Visualizing the Problem**\n\nLet's start by **visualizing** the setup:\n\n- **Equilateral Triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\):** All sides are 12 cm.\n- **Circle:** The diameter is one side of the triangle, say \\( AB \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince \\( AB \\) is the diameter, the **center of the circle** must be the midpoint of \\( AB \\). Thus, the circle is **circumscribed** around the triangle with respect to side \\( AB \\).\n\n**Wait a Minute:**  \nBut hold on, usually, a circle circumscribes a triangle by touching all vertices. Here, only one side is the diameter. This suggests the circle passes through more points of the triangle.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nMaybe the circle also passes through the other vertex \\( C \\). If the circle's diameter is \\( AB \\), and the triangle is equilateral, vertex \\( C \\) lies on the circle. This forms a **semicircle** over \\( AB \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Shaded Regions**\n\nNow, let's identify where the **shaded regions** are:\n\n- The shaded regions are likely the parts of the triangle outside the circle or vice versa.\n- Given the setup, these regions could be **lens-shaped** areas formed by the intersection of the circle and the triangle.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI think the shaded regions are the parts of the triangle that lie outside the semicircle but inside the triangle. This reminds me of **circular segments**.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, because the circle covers part of the triangle, and the shaded regions are what's left out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Area of the Circle**\n\nLet's find the area of the **circle** first:\n\n- **Diameter \\( AB \\) = 12 cm**, so the **radius \\( r \\) = 6 cm**.\n- **Area of the Circle \\( A_{\\text{circle}} \\):**\n  \\[\n  A_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (6)^2 = 36\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nCalculating the full circle's area gives a baseline. But since only half of the circle (a semicircle) is involved with the triangle, maybe I should consider that instead.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs this relevant? Yes, because only the semicircle overlaps with the triangle.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nPerhaps I only need the area of the **semicircle**:\n\n- **Area of the Semicircle \\( A_{\\text{semicircle}} \\):**\n  \\[\n  A_{\\text{semicircle}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 36\\pi = 18\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Area of the Equilateral Triangle**\n\nNext, let's find the area of the **equilateral triangle**:\n\n- **Side Length \\( s = 12 \\) cm**\n- **Formula for the Area \\( A_{\\text{triangle}} \\):**\n  \\[\n  A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (12)^2 = 36\\sqrt{3} \\, \\text{cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 144 = 36\\sqrt{3}\\). That seems correct.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nKnowing both the triangle and semicircle's areas helps in determining the overlapping and non-overlapping parts.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determining the Shaded Regions' Area**\n\nNow, to find the **shaded regions**, we need to calculate the parts of the triangle not covered by the semicircle.\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n\n1. **Subtract the Semicircle's Area from the Triangle's:**\n   - But this would give the area outside the semicircle, which isn't entirely correct since we need only specific parts.\n\n2. **Find the Overlapping Area and Subtract:**\n   - Calculate the area where the semicircle and triangle overlap and subtract it from the triangle's area.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe second approach seems more precise. We need to find the area of the **circular segments** formed by the semicircle within the triangle and subtract this from the total triangle area.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Overlapping Area**\n\nLet's determine the area where the semicircle overlaps with the triangle:\n\n- The overlapping area consists of **two circular segments** on either end of the semicircle.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEach shaded region corresponds to a **60-degree segment** of the semicircle because the triangle's angles are \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Total Angle of Semicircle:** \\(180^\\circ\\)\n- **Angles Corresponding to Shaded Regions:** \\(60^\\circ\\) each\n\n**So, the overlapping area consists of two \\(60^\\circ\\) segments.**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, that means \\(120^\\circ\\) of the semicircle is overlapping with the triangle. Therefore, the sum of the areas of these two segments needs to be subtracted from the triangle's area to get the shaded regions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Calculating the Area of One Circular Segment**\n\nLet's find the area of one **60-degree segment** of the semicircle:\n\n- **Radius \\( r = 6 \\) cm**\n- **Angle \\( \\theta = 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\) radians**\n\n**Area of a Segment \\( A_{\\text{segment}} \\):**\n\\[\nA_{\\text{segment}} = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 (\\theta - \\sin\\theta)\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{segment}} = \\frac{1}{2} (6)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 18 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 6\\pi - 9\\sqrt{3} \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis gives the area of one shaded region. Since there are **two** such regions, we'll multiply this by 2.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, each endpoint of the semicircle has a similar segment, so doubling the area should give the total shaded area.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Calculating the Total Shaded Area**\n\nNow, let's find the total area of the **two shaded regions**:\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{shaded}} = 2 \\times (6\\pi - 9\\sqrt{3}) = 12\\pi - 18\\sqrt{3} \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nMultiplying \\(6\\pi\\) by 2 gives \\(12\\pi\\), and \\(9\\sqrt{3}\\) by 2 gives \\(18\\sqrt{3}\\). This seems correct.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis represents the total area of the two shaded regions outside the semicircle but inside the triangle.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Expressing the Area in the Given Form**\n\nWe have the shaded area as:\n\\[\n12\\pi - 18\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nComparing with the desired form \\(a\\pi - b\\sqrt{c}\\):\n- \\(a = 12\\)\n- \\(b = 18\\)\n- \\(c = 3\\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\na + b + c = 12 + 18 + 3 = 33\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSumming these values gives us 33, which aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's **verify** each step to ensure accuracy:\n\n- **Circle's Area:** Calculated correctly as \\(36\\pi\\), but we only needed the semicircle\u2019s area (\\(18\\pi\\)).\n- **Triangle's Area:** Computed as \\(36\\sqrt{3}\\), which is correct.\n- **Segment's Area:** Derived using the formula, and calculations confirm \\(6\\pi - 9\\sqrt{3}\\) per segment.\n- **Total Shaded Area:** Multiplying by 2 yields \\(12\\pi - 18\\sqrt{3}\\), which matches the required form.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll calculations check out. The approach is correct, and the final answer aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\boxed{33}\\)\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nWriting out the thought process step-by-step not only clarifies the solution but also aids in catching any potential errors early. It's a valuable tactic, especially in complex geometric problems like this one.\n\n---\n\n**Recap:**  \nBy visualizing the problem, identifying the shaded regions, and systematically calculating the necessary areas, we arrived at the correct answer. Brainstorming different strategies initially helped in choosing the most efficient path, and reflection at each step ensured accuracy.",

Also, $\\angle AEB$ cuts off the two arcs $\\widehat{AB}$ and $\\widehat{CD}$, so $m\\angle AEB=(m\\,\\widehat{AB}-m\\,\\widehat{CD}) / 2$.  Subsituting $m\\, \\widehat{AB}=180^\\circ$ and $m\\angle AEB=60^\\circ$ into this equation, we find $m\\,\\widehat{CD}=60^\\circ$.  By symmetry, $\\angle AOC$ and $\\angle DOB$ are congruent, so each one measures $(180-60)/2=60$ degrees.  It follows that $AOC$ and $DOB$ are equilateral triangles.  Therefore, we can find the area of each shaded region by subtracting the area of an equilateral triangle from the area of a sector.\n\nThe area of sector $AOC$ is $\\left(\\frac{m\\angle AOC}{360^\\circ}\\right)\\pi (\\text{radius})^2=\\frac{1}{6}\\pi(6)^2=6\\pi$.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4,$ so the area of triangle $AOC$ is $9\\sqrt{3}$.  In total, the area of the shaded region is $2(6\\pi-9\\sqrt{3})=12\\pi-18\\sqrt{3}.$  Therefore, $(a,b,c)=(12,18,3)$ and $a+b+c=\\boxed{33}$."
