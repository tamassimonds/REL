    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where it takes me. I'll approach it just like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming, making mistakes, and reflecting along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem states that \\( y^3 \\) varies inversely with \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\). That term \"varies inversely\" jumps out at me because it hints at a relationship I'm familiar with\u2014an inverse variation.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a problem involving inverse variation, similar to when I dealt with variables being inversely related back in school.\n- **Memory Recall:** I remember that when two quantities vary inversely, their product is a constant. But let me double-check if that's always the case with cubes and cube roots.\n  \n### **Step 1: Understanding Inverse Variation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIn inverse variation, as one variable increases, the other decreases such that their product remains constant.\n\n- **Equation Formation:**  \n  I know that if \\( y^3 \\) varies inversely with \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\), then:\n  \\[\n  y^3 \\times \\sqrt[3]{z} = k\n  \\]\n  where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\n- **Check:**  \n  Does this make sense? For example, if \\( y^3 \\) increases, then \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\) must decrease to keep the product \\( k \\) constant. Yup, that checks out.\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Constant \\( k \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe need to find the value of \\( k \\) using the given condition \\( y = 2 \\) when \\( z = 1 \\).\n\n- **Given:**  \n  \\( y = 2 \\) and \\( z = 1 \\)\n\n- **Calculate \\( k \\):**\n  \\[\n  y^3 = 2^3 = 8\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt[3]{z} = \\sqrt[3]{1} = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  k = y^3 \\times \\sqrt[3]{z} = 8 \\times 1 = 8\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  So, \\( k = 8 \\). This seems correct because multiplying \\( y^3 \\) by \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\) gives me the constant.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulating the Equation with the Constant**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have \\( k = 8 \\), I can write the equation relating \\( y \\) and \\( z \\):\n\\[\ny^3 \\times \\sqrt[3]{z} = 8\n\\]\n\n- **Check:**    \n  Is this the correct equation? Yes, because it incorporates both variables and the constant we just determined.\n\n### **Step 4: Finding \\( z \\) When \\( y = 4 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to determine \\( z \\) when \\( y = 4 \\). I'll substitute \\( y = 4 \\) into the equation and solve for \\( z \\).\n\n- **Given:**  \n  \\( y = 4 \\)\n\n- **Calculate \\( y^3 \\):**\n  \\[\n  y^3 = 4^3 = 64\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substitute into the equation:**\n  \\[\n  64 \\times \\sqrt[3]{z} = 8\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving for \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt[3]{z} = \\frac{8}{64} = \\frac{1}{8}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  \\(\\sqrt[3]{z} = \\frac{1}{8}\\) makes sense because dividing by a larger number decreases the cube root value, aligning with inverse variation.\n\n### **Step 5: Solving for \\( z \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo find \\( z \\), I need to cube both sides since we have \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\).\n\n- **Cubing Both Sides:**\n  \\[\n  z = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{512}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:**  \n  Is \\( z = \\frac{1}{512} \\) reasonable? Let's see:\n  \n  - **Dimensional Analysis:**  \n    If \\( y \\) increases, \\( z \\) should decrease to maintain the constant \\( k \\). Since \\( y \\) is doubling from 2 to 4, \\( z \\) should indeed decrease from 1 to a larger fractional value, which \\( \\frac{1}{512} \\) is.\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, let me check if this value of \\( z \\) satisfies the original condition.\n\n- **Original Equation:**\n  \\[\n  y^3 \\times \\sqrt[3]{z} = 8\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substituting \\( y = 4 \\) and \\( z = \\frac{1}{512} \\):**\n  \\[\n  64 \\times \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{512}} = 64 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 8\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:**  \n  Both sides equal 8, which matches \\( k \\). Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n### **Final Thought:**\n\nThroughout this problem, I started by recognizing the inverse variation relationship, determined the constant \\( k \\) using the provided values, and then solved for \\( z \\) when \\( y = 4 \\). By checking each step and ensuring the values satisfied the original equation, I confirmed that \\( z = \\frac{1}{512} \\) is indeed the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\nz = \\frac{1}{512}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through each part, checking my work, and being open to adjusting my approach, I've arrived at the solution methodically. Just like solving it on paper, reflecting and verifying along the way ensures accuracy.",
