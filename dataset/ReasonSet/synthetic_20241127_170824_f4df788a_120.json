We'll maintain the conversational tone, ensuring it flows naturally while keeping the final answer intact.\n\n---\n\n### **Tackling the Trapezoid Area Problem: A Step-by-Step Journey**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this trapezoid area problem, walking through it just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm, reflect, and check my work along the way to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nSo, here's what we know:\n\n- We have a trapezoid.\n- One base is twice its height, \\( x \\).\n- The other base is three times the height.\n  \n**Initial Reaction:**  \nHmm, this reminds me of the area formula for trapezoids. But wait, do I remember it correctly? I think it involves the bases and the height. Let me brainstorm some strategies to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Area Formula for a Trapezoid:**  \n   I believe the formula is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{Base}_1 + \\text{Base}_2) \\times \\text{Height}\n   \\]  \n   Maybe I can plug in the given base lengths in terms of \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Visualize the Trapezoid:**  \n   Perhaps sketching it out will help. If one base is twice the height and the other is three times, I can see how the dimensions relate.\n\n3. **Check for Symmetry or Simplification:**  \n   Is there a way to simplify the expression before calculating the area? Maybe factor out common terms.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUsing the area formula directly seems straightforward. Visualizing confirms that the bases are proportional to the height, which aligns with the formula. I think starting with the formula is a good path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Assign Variables**\n\nLet's assign the given dimensions:\n\n- **Height \\( h = x \\)**\n- **Base 1 \\( b_1 = 2x \\)**\n- **Base 2 \\( b_2 = 3x \\)**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nAssigning variables helps to organize the information. It looks like everything is expressed in terms of \\( x \\), which is convenient for forming the area expression.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Apply the Trapezoid Area Formula**\n\nNow, let's plug these into the area formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (b_1 + b_2) \\times h\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2x + 3x) \\times x\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\\[\n2x + 3x = 5x\n\\]  \nSo,  \n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5x \\times x\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:  \n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{5x^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat seems straightforward. But let me double-check to ensure no mistakes were made in adding the bases or multiplying by the height.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Calculation**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify each component:\n\n- **Sum of Bases:**  \n  \\( 2x + 3x = 5x \\) \u2014 Correct.\n\n- **Multiplying by Height:**  \n  \\( 5x \\times x = 5x^2 \\) \u2014 Makes sense.\n\n- **Applying the Fraction:**  \n  \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5x^2 = \\frac{5x^2}{2} \\) \u2014 Looks good.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIs the area expression in the simplest form? Yes, \\( \\frac{5x^2}{2} \\) is a common fraction.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nEverything checks out. The calculation steps are consistent with the formula, and the expression is simplified properly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Alternative Approach to Confirm**\n\nLet\u2019s try a different method to ensure the answer is correct. Suppose we consider the trapezoid as a combination of shapes or use another geometry principle.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nVisualize the trapezoid as a rectangle plus two right triangles. But wait, the bases are proportional to the height, making this approach less straightforward.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nTrying to decompose the trapezoid doesn\u2019t immediately offer a simpler path. The original method using the area formula seems more efficient.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe initial approach is valid, and the alternative doesn\u2019t provide additional benefits. Stick with the original method.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{5x^2}{2}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, verifying each step, and considering alternative methods, we've confidently arrived at the expression for the area of the trapezoid. The key was to methodically apply the trapezoid area formula and ensure each component was correctly calculated.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThinking through each step, checking for correctness, and being open to adjusting the approach helped in arriving at the correct solution. It's essential to verify calculations and remain flexible in problem-solving strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThere we go! By embracing a human-like problem-solving approach\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, and verifying\u2014we\u2019ve successfully solved the problem. The area of the trapezoid is \\(\\frac{5x^2}{2}\\), and each step along the way was carefully considered and confirmed.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's the complete solution!",
  "ground_truth": "The area of a trapezoid is equal to the product of the height and the average of the lengths of the bases. In this case, since the length of the two bases are $2x$ and $3x$ and the length of the height is $x$, the area is equal to $\\frac{2x+3x}{2} \\cdot x=\\frac{5x}{2}\\cdot x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5x^2}{2}}$."
