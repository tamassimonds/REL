  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into the solution and put everything together into a concise and coherent narrative, ensuring that the final answer remains unchanged. I'll keep the original thought process intact but streamline it to maintain clarity and flow.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have an **equilateral triangle** with an **altitude of \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) units**. Our goal is to find the **area** of this triangle and express the answer in the simplest **radical form**.\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nWhen dealing with equilateral triangles, all sides are equal, and specific relationships exist between the sides and the altitudes. I recall that splitting the triangle into **right triangles** can be helpful. Let's explore different strategies to see which one fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Area Formula with Altitude:**  \n   \\(\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). Since it's equilateral, the base relates to the altitude.\n\n2. **Relate Altitude to Side Length Using 30-60-90 Triangles:**  \n   Splitting the equilateral triangle into two **30-60-90 right triangles** might help find the side length.\n\n3. **Trigonometric Approach:**  \n   Using sine or cosine to relate the altitude and side lengths.\n\n**Initial Preference:**  \nThe second option seems familiar and straightforward. I remember that in a **30-60-90 triangle**, the sides have fixed ratios. Let's start there.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Relate Altitude to Side Length**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf I can determine the side length using the altitude, calculating the area becomes straightforward.\n\n- **Recall:** In a **30-60-90 triangle**, the side ratios are:\n  - Shortest side: \\(x\\)\n  - Longer side (altitude): \\(x\\sqrt{3}\\)\n  - Hypotenuse (side of the equilateral triangle): \\(2x\\)\n\nGiven that the **altitude** is \\(\\sqrt{6}\\), I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nx\\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\):**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6} \\times \\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{18}}{3} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{3} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, because multiplying \\(x = \\sqrt{2}\\) by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) returns the given altitude \\(\\sqrt{6}\\). \n\nTherefore, the **shortest side** \\(x = \\sqrt{2}\\), and the **hypotenuse** (side length of the equilateral triangle) is:\n\n\\[\n2x = 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Area Using the Side Length**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have the side length, I can use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle.\n\n- **Formula:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times (\\text{side length})^2\n  \\]\n\nPlugging in the side length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times (2\\sqrt{2})^2\n\\]\n\n**Calculating:**\n\n\\[\n(2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 \\times 2 = 8\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 8 = 2\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes this result make sense? The area being \\(2\\sqrt{3}\\) aligns with the calculations. However, to ensure accuracy, let's double-check using another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Use the Basic Area Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo verify, I'll employ the basic area formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\n- **Base:** The side length is \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n- **Height:** Given as \\(\\sqrt{6}\\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{6} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThe result matches the previous calculation, confirming the correctness of the approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}} \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies and verifying calculations through multiple methods, I've confidently arrived at the solution. Initially, relating the altitude to the side length using the properties of a **30-60-90 triangle** provided a clear path. Cross-checking with the basic area formula ensured the correctness of the approach.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nStarting with brainstorming was beneficial. Although trigonometry was an option, sticking to geometric properties proved more straightforward. Double-checking with the basic area formula served as a reliable verification step, ensuring the accuracy of the solution. It's crucial to remain flexible and verify results through multiple approaches to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\nThere we go! By maintaining the original thought process but organizing it more cohesively, we've crafted a complete and clear solution.",
  "ground_truth": "Drawing an altitude of an equilateral triangle splits it into two 30-60-90 right triangles: [asy]\nunitsize(0.6inch);\npair A, B, C, F;\nA = (0,1);\nB = rotate(120)*A;\nC = rotate(120)*B;\nF = foot(A,B,C);\ndraw(A--B--C--A,linewidth(1));\ndraw(A--F);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$M$\",F,S);\n[/asy]\n\n\nThe altitude is the longer leg of each 30-60-90 triangle, so $AM = \\sqrt{3}\\cdot BM$ in the diagram above. Since $AM = \\sqrt{6}$, we have \\[BM = \\frac{AM}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac63} = \\sqrt{2}.\\] Therefore, we have $BC = 2BM = 2\\sqrt{2}$, so the area of the triangle is $(BC)(AM)/2 = (2\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{6})/2\n=\\sqrt{12} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}$ square units."
