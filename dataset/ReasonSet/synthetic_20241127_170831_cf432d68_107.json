  "problem": "What is the residue of $9^{2010}$, modulo 17?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem by thinking through it step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll explore different strategies, reflect on each step, and ensure that the final solution is coherent and complete. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question asks for the residue of \\(9^{2010}\\) modulo 17. Right off the bat, I recognize this as a modular arithmetic problem. My initial instinct is to recall methods like **Fermat's Little Theorem** or exploring patterns in powers, but honestly, I'm not entirely sure which will be the most efficient yet. Let's brainstorm a bit to see which approach might work best.\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Fermat's Little Theorem (FLT):**  \n   I remember FLT states that if \\(p\\) is prime and \\(a\\) is an integer not divisible by \\(p\\), then \\(a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p\\). Since 17 is prime, this could be useful.\n\n2. **Exploring Patterns in Powers:**  \n   Another approach is to compute the first few powers of 9 modulo 17 to see if a pattern emerges. If there's a repeating cycle, I can use it to simplify \\(9^{2010}\\).\n\n3. **Direct Computation Using Exponentiation by Squaring:**  \n   Perhaps using a method like exponentiation by squaring to compute the power more efficiently while taking mod 17 at each step.\n\n4. **Chinese Remainder Theorem:**  \n   Although this seems overkill since we're only dealing with one modulus, it's worth considering all tools.\n\n#### **Choosing a Strategy**\n\nI'm leaning towards **Fermat's Little Theorem** because it often simplifies large exponents modulo a prime. But let\u2019s explore the **pattern in powers** first to see if it offers a straightforward insight.\n\n### **Exploring Patterns in Powers**\n\nLet's compute the first few powers of 9 modulo 17 to see if there's a cycle:\n\n- \\(9^1 \\equiv 9 \\mod 17\\)  \n  \\[9 \\mod 17 = 9\\]  \n  *This is straightforward.*\n\n- \\(9^2 \\equiv 81 \\mod 17\\)  \n  \\[81 \\div 17 = 4 \\text{ remainder } 13 \\Rightarrow 81 \\equiv 13 \\mod 17\\]  \n  *So, \\(9^2 \\equiv 13\\).*\n\n- \\(9^3 \\equiv 9 \\times 13 \\equiv 117 \\mod 17\\)  \n  \\[117 \\div 17 = 6 \\text{ remainder } 15 \\Rightarrow 117 \\equiv 15 \\mod 17\\]  \n  *Thus, \\(9^3 \\equiv 15\\).*\n\n- \\(9^4 \\equiv 9 \\times 15 \\equiv 135 \\mod 17\\)  \n  \\[135 \\div 17 = 7 \\text{ remainder } 16 \\Rightarrow 135 \\equiv 16 \\mod 17\\]  \n  *So, \\(9^4 \\equiv 16\\).*\n\n- \\(9^5 \\equiv 9 \\times 16 \\equiv 144 \\mod 17\\)  \n  \\[144 \\div 17 = 8 \\text{ remainder } 8 \\Rightarrow 144 \\equiv 8 \\mod 17\\]  \n  *Therefore, \\(9^5 \\equiv 8\\).*\n\n- \\(9^6 \\equiv 9 \\times 8 \\equiv 72 \\mod 17\\)  \n  \\[72 \\div 17 = 4 \\text{ remainder } 4 \\Rightarrow 72 \\equiv 4 \\mod 17\\]  \n  *Thus, \\(9^6 \\equiv 4\\).*\n\n- \\(9^7 \\equiv 9 \\times 4 \\equiv 36 \\mod 17\\)  \n  \\[36 \\div 17 = 2 \\text{ remainder } 2 \\Rightarrow 36 \\equiv 2 \\mod 17\\]  \n  *So, \\(9^7 \\equiv 2\\).*\n\n- **\\(9^8 \\equiv 9 \\times 2 \\equiv 18 \\mod 17\\)**  \n  \\[18 \\div 17 = 1 \\text{ remainder } 1 \\Rightarrow 18 \\equiv 1 \\mod 17\\]  \n  *Ah, \\(9^8 \\equiv 1\\)!*\n\n#### **Reflection**\n\nWait a minute! This is a significant observation. \\(9^8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 17\\) means that every multiple of 8 in the exponent will bring us back to 1. This reminds me of **Euler's theorem**, but since we're modulo a prime, it's aligning with FLT as well.\n\n### **Leveraging the Pattern**\n\nGiven that \\(9^8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 17\\), we can express \\(9^{2010}\\) in terms of \\(9^8\\):\n\n\\[\n9^{2010} = (9^8)^{251} \\times 9^2\n\\]\n\n**Why did I choose this?**  \nBecause:\n\\[\n2010 = 8 \\times 251 + 2\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n9^{2010} = (9^8)^{251} \\times 9^2 \\equiv 1^{251} \\times 9^2 \\equiv 9^2 \\mod 17\n\\]\n\n### **Calculating \\(9^2 \\mod 17\\)**\n\nFrom our earlier computation:\n\\[\n9^2 \\equiv 13 \\mod 17\n\\]\n\n### **Intermediate Conclusion**\n\nAt this point, it looks like \\(9^{2010} \\equiv 13 \\mod 17\\). But before finalizing, let\u2019s verify this using a different approach to ensure correctness.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Fermat's Little Theorem**\n\nLet\u2019s apply **Fermat's Little Theorem** directly:\n\nFLT states:\n\\[\n9^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 17\n\\]\nBecause 17 is prime and 9 is not divisible by 17.\n\nNow, let's break down 2010 in terms of 16:\n\\[\n2010 = 16 \\times 125 + 10\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n9^{2010} = (9^{16})^{125} \\times 9^{10} \\equiv 1^{125} \\times 9^{10} \\equiv 9^{10} \\mod 17\n\\]\n\n### **But Wait, We Need \\(9^{10}\\) ...**\n\nHmm, this requires computing \\(9^{10} \\mod 17\\). Let's see if our previous pattern can help:\n\nWe already know:\n\\[\n9^8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 17\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\n9^{10} = 9^8 \\times 9^2 \\equiv 1 \\times 9^2 \\equiv 9^2 \\mod 17\n\\]\nAnd from earlier:\n\\[\n9^2 \\equiv 13 \\mod 17\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n9^{10} \\equiv 13 \\mod 17\n\\]\n\n### **Final Verification**\n\nBoth approaches\u2014pattern analysis and Fermat's Little Theorem\u2014lead us to the same conclusion. This consistency gives me confidence that the solution is correct.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9^{2010} \\equiv 13 \\mod 17}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nExploring different strategies helped ensure the correctness of the solution. Starting with pattern recognition provided a straightforward path, while Fermat's Little Theorem served as a robust verification method. Always reflecting and cross-checking using multiple methods is valuable, especially in problems involving large exponents and modular arithmetic.\n\n---\n\nThere you have it! By methodically exploring different strategies, verifying through multiple approaches, and reflecting at each step, we've arrived confidently at the correct residue of \\(9^{2010}\\) modulo 17, which is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "We start by generating powers of 9 modulo 17. Note that we can generate $9^{2k}$ from $9^k$ by squaring $9^k$. We get \\begin{align*}\n9^1 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{17} \\\\\n9^2 &\\equiv 13 \\pmod{17} \\\\\n9^4 &\\equiv 16 \\pmod{17} \\\\\n9^8 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}.\n\\end{align*}Since $9^8 \\equiv 1$ modulo 17, we have \\begin{align*}\n9^{2010} &\\equiv 9^2 9^{2008} \\\\\n&\\equiv 9^2 (9^8)^{251} \\\\\n&\\equiv 9^2 1^{251} \\\\\n&\\equiv 9^2 \\\\\n&\\equiv \\boxed{13} \\pmod{17}.\n\\end{align*}"
