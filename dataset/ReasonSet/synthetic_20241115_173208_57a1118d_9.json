    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's see where it leads!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about finding the area of a small kite drawn on a grid. Genevieve also makes a larger kite by tripling both the height and width of the grid. I need to find the area of the small kite.\n\n- **Kite Shape:** Hmm, I remember kites are quadrilaterals with two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal. But, unlike squares or rectangles, kites don't have right angles necessarily. This is probably key to figuring out the area.\n\n- **Grid with Integer Points:** The kite is drawn on a grid where points are one inch apart. This makes me think about using coordinates to calculate distances or areas since the grid provides a clear scale.\n\n- **Tripling the Grid:** Making the large kite triple the height and width of the grid seems like it scales everything up, but I think we only need to focus on the small kite's area for now.\n\n**What I'm Unsure About:**\n\n- **Using Coordinates:** I'm not entirely sure if using coordinate geometry is the best approach here. Maybe there's a simpler way, like using the properties of kites.\n\n- **Area Calculation Methods:** I've heard of using diagonals or even breaking the shape into triangles for kites. I'll have to think about which method would be more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Using Coordinates to Find the Area**\n\nLet me consider assigning coordinates to the kite's vertices and then using the formula for the area based on coordinates.\n\n- **Assigning Coordinates:** The kite's corners are given as points on the grid. I could map these out:\n  - Top point at (0, 5)\n  - Right point at (3, 7)\n  - Bottom point at (6, 5)\n  - Left point at (3, 0)\n\n- **Thinking It Through:** Wait, does this make sense? Let me double-check the coordinates. The kite is symmetric, so I expect the points to reflect that.\n\n  - **Reflection Check:** The top and bottom points are at y = 5 and y = 0, while the left and right points are x = 3. That seems symmetric.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** The coordinates seem reasonable at first glance, but I need to ensure they correctly represent the kite's shape.\n\n- **Concerns:** Maybe using coordinates could get messy with calculations. Is there a more intuitive method?\n\n---\n\n**Strategy 2: Calculating Area Using the Lengths of Diagonals**\n\nAnother approach I recall is that for a kite, the area can be calculated using the lengths of its diagonals:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{d_1 \\times d_2}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\) are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\n- **Identifying Diagonals:** In the given kite:\n  - One diagonal runs from (0, 5) to (6, 5) \u2014 horizontal\n  - The other diagonal runs from (3, 7) to (3, 0) \u2014 vertical\n\n- **Calculating Lengths:**\n  - \\(d_1\\) (horizontal) = distance between (0, 5) and (6, 5) = 6 units\n  - \\(d_2\\) (vertical) = distance between (3, 7) and (3, 0) = 7 units\n\n- **Plugging into the Formula:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{6 \\times 7}{2} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Multiplying 6 and 7 gives 42, dividing by 2 gives 21. That sounds reasonable.\n\n- **Does It Make Sense?:** The area calculation seems correct since it aligns with the properties of kites and the given coordinates.\n\n- **Confirming the Approach:** Using diagonal lengths is a standard method for calculating the area of a kite, so I feel confident about this solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure everything checks out.\n\n- **Diagonal Lengths:** I calculated the lengths of the diagonals correctly based on the coordinates provided.\n\n- **Area Formula Application:** The formula was applied correctly, dividing the product of the diagonals by 2.\n\n- **Final Answer Consistency:** The area comes out to be 21 square inches, which aligns with the expectations for a kite of this size on the given grid.\n\n**Possible Mistakes or Alternative Approaches:**\n\n- **Alternative Method:** Another way to find the area of a kite is by dividing it into four right triangles and calculating their combined area. However, I think using the diagonals was more straightforward here.\n\n- **Checking for Errors:** I don't see any errors in the calculations or the approach. The diagonal lengths and the application of the area formula are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, I believe using the lengths of the diagonals was the most efficient way to calculate the area of the small kite.\n\n- **Final Check:** Everything checks out \u2014 the diagonal lengths are correct, the area formula was applied properly, and the final answer makes sense.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Genevieve's small kite has an area of **21 square inches**.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Does It Feel Right?:** Yes, the approach and the answer align with the properties of kites and the given data. Using diagonal lengths is a reliable method for this type of problem.\n\n- **Learning Point:** It's always good to brainstorm and consider multiple strategies, but sometimes sticking with a well-known formula, like the one for kites' area using diagonals, can lead to a quick and accurate solution.\n\n---\n\nAlright, that's how I'd think through this problem step by step, checking and reflecting along the way to ensure the approach and answer are correct!",
