    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure everything checks out as we go along.\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's make sure I fully understand what's being asked:\n\nWe have a piecewise function \\( f(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n3x^2 + 2 & \\text{if } x \\le 3, \\\\\nax - 1 & \\text{if } x > 3.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThe goal is to find the value of \\( a \\) that makes the graph of \\( f(x) \\) continuous. In other words, there should be no jumps or breaks in the graph at \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n- **Continuity at \\( x = 3 \\):** Since the function changes its definition at \\( x = 3 \\), that's where continuity might be an issue. So, I need to ensure that both parts of the function connect seamlessly at \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Set the Two Pieces Equal at \\( x = 3 \\):** If both parts of the function yield the same value at \\( x = 3 \\), then the function is continuous there.\n  2. **Check Limits from Both Sides:** Ensure that the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 3 from the left equals the limit from the right and equals \\( f(3) \\).\n\nI think setting the two pieces equal at \\( x = 3 \\) is a straightforward approach. Let's start with that.\n\n### **Step 1: Set the Two Pieces Equal at \\( x = 3 \\)**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nFor the function to be continuous at \\( x = 3 \\), the value from the left (\\( x \\le 3 \\)) should match the value from the right (\\( x > 3 \\)).\n\n**Write it Out:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{At } x = 3, \\quad 3(3)^2 + 2 = a(3) - 1\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n3(9) + 2 = 27 + 2 = 29\n\\]\n\\[\n29 = 3a - 1\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( a \\):**\n\n\\[\n29 + 1 = 3a \\implies 30 = 3a \\implies a = \\frac{30}{3} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so setting the two pieces equal gave me \\( a = 10 \\). But it's always good to double-check. Let\u2019s verify by considering the limits.\n\n### **Step 2: Verify with Limits**\n\n**Approach:**  \nCheck that the left-hand limit \\( \\lim_{x \\to 3^-} f(x) \\) equals the right-hand limit \\( \\lim_{x \\to 3^+} f(x) \\) and both equal \\( f(3) \\).\n\n**Left-Hand Limit \\( \\lim_{x \\to 3^-} f(x) \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 3^-} (3x^2 + 2) = 3(3)^2 + 2 = 29\n\\]\n\n**Right-Hand Limit \\( \\lim_{x \\to 3^+} f(x) \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 3^+} (ax - 1) = a(3) - 1 = 3a - 1\n\\]\n\n**Set Limits Equal:**\n\n\\[\n29 = 3a - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n29 + 1 = 3a \\implies 30 = 3a \\implies a = 10\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \nBoth methods agree that \\( a = 10 \\). This consistency strengthens the correctness of the solution.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Check**\n\n**Substitute Back to Verify Continuity:**\n\nWith \\( a = 10 \\), the right-hand piece becomes \\( f(x) = 10x - 1 \\) for \\( x > 3 \\).\n\n**Calculate \\( f(x) \\) at \\( x = 3 \\) from Both Sides:**\n\n- **Left Side (\\( x \\le 3 \\)):**\n  \\[\n  f(3) = 3(3)^2 + 2 = 29\n  \\]\n\n- **Right Side (\\( x > 3 \\)):**\n  \\[\n  f(3) = 10(3) - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBoth sides equal 29 at \\( x = 3 \\), confirming continuity.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy setting the two pieces of the function equal at the point of transition and verifying using limits, we've consistently found that \\( a = 10 \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is continuous at \\( x = 3 \\) with this value of \\( a \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "If the graph of $f$ is continuous, then the graphs of the two cases must meet when $x=3$, which (loosely speaking) is the dividing point between the two cases.  Therefore, we must have $3(3^2) + 2 = 3a - 1$.  Solving this equation gives $a = \\boxed{10}$."
