    "working_out": "**Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. The question asks about the interior angles of a convex hexagon that form an increasing arithmetic sequence. We're to determine how many such sequences are possible under the conditions that the hexagon is not equiangular and each angle is a positive integer less than 150 degrees.\n\nAt first glance, several things come to mind:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:** I recall that in an arithmetic sequence, each term differs from the previous one by a constant difference. This seems fundamental to setting up the problem.\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles:** I know that for any hexagon, the sum of the interior angles is fixed. Specifically, for a hexagon, the sum is \\(720\\) degrees. This fact might help in setting up equations.\n\n3. **Constraints on Angles:** Each angle must be less than \\(150\\) degrees and must be a positive integer. Also, since the hexagon is not equiangular, the common difference in the arithmetic sequence should be non-zero.\n\n4. **Equations Setup:** Perhaps I'll need to set up an equation involving the sum of the angles and solve for the terms of the sequence.\n\n5. **Checking for Multiple Solutions:** Given the constraints, there might be multiple valid sequences, but I need to ensure they all adhere to the rules, especially the non-equal angle condition.\n\nReflecting on these points, I realize I need to explore how to represent the angles in terms of an arithmetic sequence and then apply the sum constraint to find valid sequences.\n\n**Step 1: Defining the Arithmetic Sequence**\n\nLet\u2019s start by defining the angles of the hexagon as an arithmetic sequence:\n\n- There are six angles: \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6\\).\n- Since it\u2019s an increasing sequence with a common difference \\(d\\), we can express the angles as:\n  \\[\n  a_1 = a\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a_2 = a + d\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a_3 = a + 2d\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a_4 = a + 3d\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a_5 = a + 4d\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a_6 = a + 5d\n  \\]\n  \nWait, does this seem right? I think defining it this way is okay because it captures the arithmetic property. But let me quickly check if this setup covers all angles and maintains the sequence. Yes, each angle increments by \\(d\\), starting from \\(a\\).\n\n**Step 2: Applying the Sum of Interior Angles Constraint**\n\nNow, I need to use the fact that the sum of all interior angles in a hexagon is \\(720\\) degrees:\n\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 720\n\\]\n\nPlugging in our expressions:\n\n\\[\na + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + (a + 4d) + (a + 5d) = 720\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[\n6a + 15d = 720\n\\]\n\nHmm, so I ended up with the equation \\(6a + 15d = 720\\). Let me double-check the simplification:\n\n\\[\na + a + d + a + 2d + a + 3d + a + 4d + a + 5d = 720\n\\]\n\\[\n6a + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)d = 720\n\\]\n\\[\n6a + 15d = 720\n\\]\n\nOkay, that looks correct. This equation relates \\(a\\) and \\(d\\).\n\n**Step 3: Solving for \\(a\\) in Terms of \\(d\\)**\n\nI think it might be helpful to express \\(a\\) in terms of \\(d\\) to see how they are connected. Let\u2019s solve the equation for \\(a\\):\n\n\\[\n6a + 15d = 720\n\\]\n\\[\n6a = 720 - 15d\n\\]\n\\[\na = \\frac{720 - 15d}{6}\n\\]\n\\]\n\\[\na = 120 - \\frac{5d}{2}\n\\]\n\nWait, let me pause and check this. If \\(d\\) is, say, \\(2\\), then:\n\n\\[\na = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 2}{2} = 120 - 5 = 115\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(a\\) would be \\(115\\) degrees when \\(d = 2\\). That seems reasonable.\n\n**Step 4: Ensuring All Angles Are Less Than 150 Degrees**\n\nNow, let's ensure that all angles are less than \\(150\\) degrees. The largest angle in the sequence is \\(a + 5d\\). So, we need:\n\n\\[\na + 5d < 150\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(a\\) from earlier:\n\n\\[\n(120 - \\frac{5d}{2}) + 5d < 150\n\\]\n\\[\n120 - \\frac{5d}{2} + 5d < 150\n\\]\n\\[\n120 + \\frac{5d}{2} < 150\n\\]\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{5d}{2} < 30\n\\]\n\\]\n\\[\n5d < 60\n\\]\n\\]\n\\[\nd < 12\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(d\\) must be less than \\(12\\).\n\nHmm, this tells me that the common difference can be at most \\(11\\). But wait, I also need to consider that the hexagon is not equiangular, meaning \\(d \\neq 0\\). Let's jot down these constraints:\n\n- \\(0 < d < 12\\)\n\n**Step 5: Considering the Non-Equiangular Condition**\n\nThe problem states that the hexagon is not equiangular, which means \\(d\\) cannot be \\(0\\). However, \\(d\\) is already bound by the upper limit of \\(11\\) from the previous step.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let\u2019s consider the effects of having \\(d\\) as \\(1\\) to \\(11\\) and ensure no angle exceeds \\(150\\) degrees.\n\nFor \\(d = 1\\):\n\n\\[\na = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 1}{2} = 120 - 2.5 = 117.5 \\text{ (not an integer)}\n\\]\n\nWait, \\(a\\) must be an integer. Let me see if this checks out. Since \\(a\\) needs to be a positive integer, and \\(117.5\\) isn't, this value of \\(d\\) doesn't work.\n\nMaybe I need to adjust my approach. Perhaps \\(d\\) needs to be even, so \\(\\frac{5d}{2}\\) results in an integer. \n\nBut wait, that might not be necessary since \\(a\\) must still be an integer. Let's see.\n\n**Step 6: Checking Valid Values of \\(a\\) and \\(d\\)**\n\nI realize I need to ensure that both \\(a\\) and \\(d\\) yield integer angle measures throughout the sequence. Let's set \\(d\\) from \\(1\\) to \\(11\\) and see which values make \\(a\\) an integer.\n\n- **\\(d = 1\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 1}{2} = 117.5 \\text{ (not valid)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(d = 2\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 2}{2} = 115 \\text{ (valid)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(d = 3\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 3}{2} = 112.5 \\text{ (not valid)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(d = 4\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 110 \\text{ (valid)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(d = 5\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 5}{2} = 107.5 \\text{ (not valid)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(d = 6\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 6}{2} = 105 \\text{ (valid)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(d = 7\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 7}{2} = 102.5 \\text{ (not valid)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(d = 8\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 8}{2} = 100 \\text{ (valid)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(d = 9\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 9}{2} = 97.5 \\text{ (not valid)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(d = 10\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 10}{2} = 95 \\text{ (valid)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\(d = 11\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 120 - \\frac{5 \\times 11}{2} = 92.5 \\text{ (not valid)}\n  \\]\n\nOh, I see a pattern here. Only even values of \\(d\\) result in \\(a\\) being a valid integer. This suggests that \\(d\\) needs to be even for \\(a\\) to remain an integer.\n\n**Step 7: Enumerating Valid \\(d\\) Values**\n\nGiven that \\(d\\) must be even, let's list the possible values:\n\n- **\\(d = 2\\):** \\(a = 115\\)\n- **\\(d = 4\\):** \\(a = 110\\)\n- **\\(d = 6\\):** \\(a = 105\\)\n- **\\(d = 8\\):** \\(a = 100\\)\n- **\\(d = 10\\):** \\(a = 95\\)\n\nThat gives us five possible values for \\(d\\): \\(2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\). Each of these results in \\(a\\) being a positive integer and ensures that all angles are less than \\(150\\) degrees.\n\n**Step 8: Verifying the Sequences**\n\nLet\u2019s quickly verify the sequences for each valid \\(d\\) to ensure they satisfy all conditions:\n\n- **For \\(d = 2\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 115\n  \\]\n  Angles: \\(115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125\\)\n  \n- **For \\(d = 4\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 110\n  \\]\n  Angles: \\(110, 114, 118, 122, 126, 130\\)\n  \n- **For \\(d = 6\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 105\n  \\]\n  Angles: \\(105, 111, 117, 123, 129, 135\\)\n  \n- **For \\(d = 8\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 100\n  \\]\n  Angles: \\(100, 108, 116, 124, 132, 140\\)\n  \n- **For \\(d = 10\\):**\n  \\[\n  a = 95\n  \\]\n  Angles: \\(95, 105, 115, 125, 135, 145\\)\n  \nHmm, all sequences seem to satisfy the increasing property, and each angle is a positive integer less than \\(150\\) degrees. This looks good.\n\n**Step 9: Counting the Valid Sequences**\n\nBased on the analysis, there are five valid sequences corresponding to the even \\(d\\) values:\n\n1. \\(d = 2\\) \u2192 Angles: \\(115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125\\)\n2. \\(d = 4\\) \u2192 Angles: \\(110, 114, 118, 122, 126, 130\\)\n3. \\(d = 6\\) \u2192 Angles: \\(105, 111, 117, 123, 129, 135\\)\n4. \\(d = 8\\) \u2192 Angles: \\(100, 108, 116, 124, 132, 140\\)\n5. \\(d = 10\\) \u2192 Angles: \\(95, 105, 115, 125, 135, 145\\)\n\nSo, the total number of such sequences possible is **5**.\n\n**Final Reflection and Check**\n\nLet me reflect on the entire process to ensure everything makes sense:\n\n- **Setup:** Defining the angles as an arithmetic sequence was a good starting point. This allowed me to relate the angles through a single variable (\\(d\\)) and apply the sum constraint effectively.\n- **Constraints:** Identifying that \\(d\\) must be less than \\(12\\) and even was crucial. It streamlined the problem by reducing potential \\(d\\) values and ensuring \\(a\\) remained an integer.\n- **Verification:** Checking each \\(d\\) value ensured no invalid sequences slipped through. By enumerating and verifying, I avoided overlooking any possibility.\n- **Reflection:** Throughout, questioning whether \\(a\\) was an integer and if all angles were within bounds kept the approach aligned with the problem's requirements.\n\nI think the answer is correct. By methodically exploring and verifying each step, I've ensured that all conditions are met and that the solution is comprehensive.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of possible increasing arithmetic sequences for the interior angles of the hexagon, ensuring it is not equiangular and all angles are positive integers less than 150 degrees, is **5**.",

  "ground_truth": "The number of degrees in a hexagon is $(6-2) \\cdot 180=720$ degrees. Setting the degree of the smallest angle to be $x$, and the increment to be $d$, we get that the sum of all of the degrees is $x+x+d+x+2d+x+3d+x+4d+x+5d=6x+15d=720$. We want $15d$ to be even so that adding it to an even number $6x$ would produce an even number $720$. Therefore, $d$ must be even. The largest angle we can have must be less than $150$, so we try even values for $d$ until we get an angle that's greater or equal to $150$.  Similarly, we can conclude that $x$ must be a multiple of 5.\n\nThe largest angle is $x + 5d.$  We notice that, if we divide both sides of $6x + 15d = 720$ by 3, we get $2x + 5d = 240.$  For $x + 5d < 150,$ we must have $x > 90.$  The largest value of $d$ occurs when $x = 95$ and $5d = 240 - 2x = 240 - 2 \\cdot 95 = 240 - 190 = 50,$ or $d = 10.$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ values for $d$: $2,4,6,8,$ and $10$."
