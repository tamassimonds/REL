    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll take you through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking my work along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving this on my own.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see that point \\( P \\) lies on the line \\( x = -3 \\) and is 10 units away from the point \\( (5, 2) \\). Immediately, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Coordinates of \\( P \\)**: Since \\( P \\) is on the line \\( x = -3 \\), its x-coordinate is fixed at -3. That simplifies things a bit.\n   \n2. **Distance Formula**: The fact that \\( P \\) is 10 units away from \\( (5, 2) \\) suggests I might need to use the distance formula to find the possible y-coordinates of \\( P \\).\n\n3. **Quadratic Equation**: Since I'm dealing with two variables (x and y) and a fixed distance, this might lead to a quadratic equation, which could result in two possible y-values.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because quadratic equations can sometimes lead to complex solutions, and I want to confirm if that's the right path.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Distance Formula**: Calculate the distance between \\( P(-3, y) \\) and \\( (5, 2) \\) using the distance formula. Set that equal to 10 to solve for \\( y \\).\n\n2. **Graphical Approach**: Visualize the problem by sketching the line \\( x = -3 \\) and the circle centered at \\( (5, 2) \\) with a radius of 10. This might help in understanding the possible intersection points.\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation**: Since the x-coordinate is fixed, perhaps rearranging the distance formula could directly give me the y-coordinate(s).\n\nLet me start with the **Distance Formula** approach, as it seems the most straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Distance Formula**\n\nThe distance formula between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Point \\( P \\) is \\( (-3, y) \\)\n- Fixed point is \\( (5, 2) \\)\n- Distance = 10\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(5 - (-3))^2 + (2 - y)^2} = 10\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(5 + 3)^2 + (2 - y)^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + (2 - y)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + (2 - y)^2} = 10\n\\]\n\nAlright, so far so good. Now, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[\n64 + (2 - y)^2 = 100\n\\]\n\nSubtract 64 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n(2 - y)^2 = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\n2 - y = \\pm 6\n\\]\n\nThat gives us two equations to solve for \\( y \\):\n\n1. \\( 2 - y = 6 \\)\n2. \\( 2 - y = -6 \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for \\( y \\)**\n\n**First Equation**:\n\n\\[\n2 - y = 6\n\\]\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-y = 4\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\[\ny = -4\n\\]\n\n**Second Equation**:\n\n\\[\n2 - y = -6\n\\]\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-y = -8\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\[\ny = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, we have two possible y-coordinates: **\\( y = -4 \\) and \\( y = 8 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Checking the Solutions**\n\nBefore finalizing, it's essential to check if both solutions satisfy the original distance condition.\n\n**For \\( y = -4 \\)**:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(5 - (-3))^2 + (2 - (-4))^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n\\]\n\n**For \\( y = 8 \\)**:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(5 - (-3))^2 + (2 - 8)^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n\\]\n\nBoth solutions satisfy the distance condition. Perfect!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Product of All Possible \\( y \\)-Coordinates**\n\nNow, the problem asks for the product of all possible y-coordinates that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[\ny_1 = -4, \\quad y_2 = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, the product \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = y_1 \\times y_2 = (-4) \\times 8 = -32\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nLet me pause and reflect. Does this make sense? \n\n- I used the distance formula appropriately, considering the fixed x-coordinate.\n- Both y-values satisfy the original distance condition.\n- The product calculation seems straightforward.\n\nEverything aligns, and the approach feels correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe product of all possible y-coordinates that satisfy the given conditions is **\\( -32 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy applying the distance formula and solving the resulting equations, I was able to find the possible y-coordinates. Checking each solution ensured their validity, and the final product calculation gave the correct answer. Throughout the process, reflecting and verifying each step helped maintain accuracy and correctness.",
