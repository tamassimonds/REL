    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem by thinking it through step by step, much like how I would approach it as a human. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work often to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem, I see a table with percentage scores and the number of students who received each score. The goal is to find the **average percent score** for all 100 students.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- **Weighted Average:** This immediately reminds me of calculating a weighted average because different scores have different numbers of students.\n- **Total Score Approach:** Maybe I can calculate the total score by multiplying each percentage by the number of students and then divide by the total number of students.\n- **Probability Method:** Another way could be thinking in terms of probabilities, where each score's proportion contributes to the overall average.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure yet which method is best. Let's explore each and see which feels right.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Weighted Average Method**\n\n**Step 1:** **Understanding Weighted Averages**\n\nA weighted average takes into account the different weights (in this case, the number of students) for each score. So, I need to multiply each score by the number of students who received it, sum these products, and then divide by the total number of students.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- This seems logical because the average score should reflect the distribution of scores among the students.\n- But let me jot down the initial numbers to see if this approach makes sense.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does it seem feasible that the average would be between the highest and lowest scores? Since most students scored 80 or above, maybe the average will be on the higher side.\n\n**Calculation Attempt:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Score} = (100 \\times 7) + (90 \\times 18) + (80 \\times 35) + (70 \\times 25) + (60 \\times 10) + (50 \\times 3) + (40 \\times 2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Score} = 700 + 1620 + 2800 + 1750 + 600 + 150 + 80 = 7,700\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Percent Score} = \\frac{7,700}{100} = 77\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, an average of 77% seems lower than expected, especially since 90% and above scores are so common. Maybe I miscalculated or skipped a step. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\n**Mistake Identified:**\n- I see that I added up the scores correctly, but perhaps dividing by the total number of students (100) is misleading since the table's total doesn't account for weights. \n\n**Re-thought Approach:**\n- Maybe I should consider the **total number of score instances**, which should align perfectly with the total number of students since each student has one score. Therefore, dividing by 100 seems correct.\n\n**Re-calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Average Percent Score} = \\frac{7,700}{100} = 77\n\\]\n  \n  **Realization:**\n  - The calculation checks out. The method seems correct, though intuitively, the average should be higher given the distribution. Perhaps 77% is accurate based on the data provided.\n\n**Aha Moment:**\n- It hit me that since the scores are grouped, the average might not precisely align with any of the individual scores. This could explain why 77% feels a bit off but is mathematically correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Method: Total Score Approach**\n\n**Step 2:** **Calculating Total Score Differently**\n\nAnother way to double-check is to consider the total score as the sum of all students' scores, then divide by the total number of students.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- This seems like a straightforward confirmation of the weighted average method. If both methods yield the same result, it adds confidence in the answer.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Number of Students} = 100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Percent Score} = \\frac{\\text{Total Score}}{\\text{Total Number of Students}} = \\frac{7,700}{100} = 77\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both methods agree on the average score being 77%. This consistency suggests that the approach is correct.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this align with the distribution? Given that most students scored 80% or higher, and a significant number scored below, an average of 77% makes sense statistically.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Step 3:** **Validating the Result**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's briefly examine if the average of 77% aligns with the expected distribution.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Most students scored 80% or above (totaling 53 students), which would pull the average up.\n- A smaller number scored below 80%, so their impact on the average is less significant.\n\n**Quick Calculation:**\n- Imagine if all students scored 80%, the average would be 80%.\n- The presence of lower scores (70%, 60%, etc.) pulls the average down slightly.\n- Since lower scores are fewer in number, their effect is minimized.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The average of 77% seems plausible given the distribution. While it might feel a bit low, it's balanced by the lower scores.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Does dividing by the total number of students (100) make sense? Yes, because each student contributes equally to the average regardless of their score.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and validating the calculations, the **average percent score** for Mrs. Riley's 100 students is **77%**. Initially, the average seemed a bit low, but upon closer inspection, it aligns with the expected distribution, reflecting a balanced average across all scores.\n\nThroughout the process, brainstorming different methods, checking calculations, and reflecting on the results helped ensure the accuracy of the final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "For simplicity, divide all the percent scores by $10.$ We will account for this later by multiplying by $10.$ The average percent score is equal to the sum of all percent scores divided by the total number of students $(100).$ The sum of all percent scores is $$10\\cdot7+9\\cdot18+8\\cdot35+7\\cdot25+6\\cdot10+5\\cdot3+4\\cdot2=770.$$ Since we divided all the percent scores by $10$ in the beginning, we multiply by $10$ to get that the sum of all percent scores is $770\\cdot10=7700.$ Finally, dividing by the total number of students, we find that the average percent score is $7700/100=\\boxed{77}.$"
