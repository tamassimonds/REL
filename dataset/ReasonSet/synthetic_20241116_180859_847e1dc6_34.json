    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking if my approach is correct, and adjusting as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it manually.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the question asks for the smallest integer \\( m \\) whose cube root is of the form \\( n + r \\), where:\n- \\( n \\) is a positive integer,\n- \\( r \\) is a positive real number less than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\).\n\nMy initial reaction is that this involves cube roots and possibly some number theory or inequalities. The condition on \\( r \\) being less than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\) suggests that we're dealing with very small remainders, which might relate to precision in calculations.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Approximation Method:** Maybe I can approximate the cube root of integers and see how close they get to having a fractional part \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\).\n\n2. **Cube Root Expansion:** Use the binomial or Taylor expansion for cube roots to get a precise value and compare it with the integer part.\n\n3. **Integer Bounds:** Determine bounds for \\( m \\) by considering \\( (n + r)^3 \\) and see how \\( r \\) affects it.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic:** Explore if modular arithmetic helps in finding integers whose cubes are close to perfect cubes.\n\nHmm, the approximation method seems straightforward, but I worry it might not be precise enough. The cube root expansion could give me a more accurate picture. Let's start with that and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Exploring the Cube Root Expansion**\n\nI'll use the binomial expansion for cube roots:\n\n\\[\n(n + r)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3\n\\]\n\nWe want this to be an integer \\( m \\). So, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nm = n^3 + 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\), the terms involving \\( r \\) will be very small, especially \\( r^2 \\) and \\( r^3 \\). Maybe I can estimate \\( m \\) by ignoring these tiny terms initially.\n\n**Thought Check:**\n\nWait, if I ignore \\( r^2 \\) and \\( r^3 \\), I'm simplifying too much. The condition \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\) means \\( 3n^2r \\) could still be significant if \\( n \\) is large enough. Perhaps I should keep the first two terms for a better approximation.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Simplifying the Expression**\n\nLet\u2019s approximate \\( m \\) by considering only the most significant terms:\n\n\\[\nm \\approx n^3 + 3n^2r\n\\]\n\nI need \\( m \\) to be an integer, so \\( 3n^2r \\) must be an integer as well. Since \\( r \\) is less than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\), the product \\( 3n^2r \\) should also be a small integer.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, if \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\), then \\( 3n^2r < \\frac{3n^2}{1000} \\). For large \\( n \\), this term could still be non-negligible. But if I choose \\( n \\) large enough, maybe this term rounds to the nearest integer.\n\nOh! That means \\( 3n^2r \\) should be close to an integer, possibly 0 or 1, to keep \\( m \\) an integer.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nFrom the approximation:\n\n\\[\n3n^2r \\approx \\text{Integer}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\), let's see how \\( 3n^2r \\) behaves:\n\n\\[\n3n^2r < \\frac{3n^2}{1000}\n\\]\n\nSo, for \\( 3n^2r \\) to be an integer, \\( r \\) must be such that:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{k}{3n^2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a small integer. Since \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\), this implies:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k}{3n^2} < \\frac{1}{1000} \\implies k < \\frac{3n^2}{1000}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? If \\( k \\) is less than \\( \\frac{3n^2}{1000} \\), then \\( r \\) is indeed less than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\). I think this is a valid constraint.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Finding the Smallest \\( m \\)**\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest \\( m \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nm = n^3 + k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k = 3n^2r\n\\]\n\nwith \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\) and \\( k < \\frac{3n^2}{1000} \\).\n\nLet\u2019s consider different values of \\( n \\) and see how \\( k \\) behaves.\n\n**Case 1: \\( n = 1 \\)**\n\n\\[\nk < \\frac{3 \\times 1^2}{1000} = \\frac{3}{1000} \\approx 0.003\n\\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) must be an integer, the only possible value is \\( k = 0 \\).\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{k}{3 \\times 1^2} = 0\n\\]\n\nWait, but \\( r \\) needs to be positive. So, \\( n = 1 \\) doesn't work.\n\n**Case 2: \\( n = 2 \\)**\n\n\\[\nk < \\frac{3 \\times 2^2}{1000} = \\frac{12}{1000} = 0.012\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\( k \\) can only be 0 since it's an integer and must be less than 0.012. But \\( r \\) needs to be positive, so \\( n = 2 \\) also doesn't work.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nHmm, it seems that for \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( n = 2 \\), \\( k \\) ends up being too small to give a positive \\( r \\). Maybe I need to increase \\( n \\) further.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Continuing with Larger \\( n \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( n = 10 \\):\n\n\\[\nk < \\frac{3 \\times 10^2}{1000} = \\frac{300}{1000} = 0.3\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( k = 0 \\), which again doesn't work because \\( r = 0 \\).\n\nThis is frustrating! But I notice a pattern: for small \\( n \\), \\( k \\) is bound to be too small to make \\( r \\) positive.\n\nMaybe I need to rethink my approach. Perhaps instead of trying to make \\( k \\) an integer, I should focus on ensuring that \\( m \\) itself is minimal while satisfying the cube root condition.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Shifting the Strategy**\n\nInstead of fixing \\( k \\), let's consider \\( m \\) more directly:\n\n\\[\nm = n^3 + 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\), let's examine how small \\( m \\) can get for different \\( n \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait a minute! The term \\( 3n^2r \\) should be small enough to not push \\( m \\) into the next integer range unnecessarily. Maybe I can set a condition on how large \\( 3n^2r \\) can be relative to \\( n^3 \\).\n\nLet\u2019s see if setting \\( 3n^2r < 1 \\) works:\n\n\\[\n3n^2r < 1 \\implies r < \\frac{1}{3n^2}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\), this puts a constraint on \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3n^2} < \\frac{1}{1000} \\implies n^2 > \\frac{1}{3000} \\implies n > \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3000}} \\approx 0.577\n\\]\n\nWait, since \\( n \\) must be an integer, the smallest \\( n \\) that satisfies this is \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nBut earlier, \\( n = 1 \\) didn't work because \\( r \\) ended up being 0.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this seems contradictory. If \\( n = 1 \\) is the smallest integer, but \\( r \\) has to be positive, then I need to reconsider my constraints.\n\nPerhaps I'm misapplying the condition. Let\u2019s delve deeper.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Re-evaluating the Constraints**\n\nThe condition \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\) means that \\( 3n^2r < \\frac{3n^2}{1000} \\). For \\( m \\) to be an integer, \\( 3n^2r \\) should ideally be very close to an integer but still within this bound.\n\nLet\u2019s try setting \\( 3n^2r = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{3n^2}\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\nm = n^3 + 1 + 3nr^2 + r^3\n\\]\n\nBut since \\( r = \\frac{1}{3n^2} \\), the additional terms \\( 3nr^2 \\) and \\( r^3 \\) become negligible for large \\( n \\).\n\n**Observation:**\n\nAs \\( n \\) increases, \\( r = \\frac{1}{3n^2} \\) decreases, making \\( 3n^2r \\) an integer only when \\( n \\) is such that \\( 3n^2 \\) divides 1, which is impossible for integers \\( n \\) greater than 1.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps \\( n \\) needs to be larger than 1 to satisfy both \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\) and \\( r > 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 8: Attempting with Larger \\( n \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( n = 10 \\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{3 \\times 10^2} = \\frac{1}{300}\n\\]\n\nThis is less than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\), so it\u2019s valid.\n\nNow, calculate \\( m \\):\n\n\\[\nm = 10^3 + 1 + 3 \\times 10 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{300}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{300}\\right)^3\n\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n\\[\n10^3 = 1000\n\\]\n\\[\n1 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n3 \\times 10 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{300}\\right)^2 = 3 \\times 10 \\times \\frac{1}{90000} = \\frac{30}{90000} = \\frac{1}{3000}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{300}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27000000}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nm = 1000 + 1 + \\frac{1}{3000} + \\frac{1}{27000000}\n\\]\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should check if \\( m \\) is close to an integer or if \\( 3n^2r \\) is indeed a small integer.\n\n**Thought Check:**\n\nHmm, \\( \\frac{1}{3000} \\) is already a small number, and adding \\( \\frac{1}{27000000} \\) is negligible. So, \\( m \\) is very close to an integer.\n\nBut is it the smallest possible \\( n \\)? I\u2019m not sure. Let's check if reducing \\( n \\) still keeps \\( r \\) positive and less than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 9: Testing Smaller \\( n \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( n = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{3 \\times 5^2} = \\frac{1}{75} \\approx 0.0133\n\\]\n\nThis is greater than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\), so it\u2019s valid.\n\nCalculate \\( m \\):\n\n\\[\nm = 5^3 + 1 + 3 \\times 5 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{75}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{75}\\right)^3\n\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n\\[\n5^3 = 125\n\\]\n\\[\n1 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n3 \\times 5 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{75}\\right)^2 = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{5625} = \\frac{15}{5625} = \\frac{1}{375}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{75}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{421875}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nm = 125 + 1 + \\frac{1}{375} + \\frac{1}{421875}\n\\]\n\nAgain, this looks messy. But comparing with \\( n = 10 \\), perhaps \\( n = 5 \\) gives a smaller \\( m \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nYou know what? This is becoming too cumbersome. Maybe there's a pattern or a property I'm missing. Perhaps instead of calculating each time, I should look for a relationship between \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) that simplifies the process.\n\n---\n\n**Step 10: Looking for a General Formula**\n\nLet\u2019s reconsider the equation:\n\n\\[\nm = n^3 + 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\) and \\( r > 0 \\), maybe I can express \\( m \\) in terms of \\( n \\) and a small correction factor.\n\nSuppose:\n\n\\[\nm = n^3 + \\epsilon\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\epsilon = 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3 \\).\n\nSince \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\), calculate \\( \\epsilon \\):\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon < 3n^2 \\times \\frac{1}{1000} + 3n \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1000}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{1000}\\right)^3\n\\]\n\nWait, this still looks messy and involves too many small terms. Perhaps I should assume that \\( \\epsilon \\) is small enough that \\( m \\) is very close to \\( n^3 \\).\n\n**Thought Check:**\n\nBut is this assumption valid? It seems that for larger \\( n \\), \\( \\epsilon \\) becomes negligible, making \\( m \\) close to \\( n^3 \\). However, for smaller \\( n \\), especially \\( n = 1 \\) or \\( n = 2 \\), \\( \\epsilon \\) might be significant enough to affect \\( m \\).\n\nThis tells me that I should either:\n\n1. **Ignore Small Terms:** Assuming \\( \\epsilon \\) is negligible for large \\( n \\).\n2. **Calculate \\( \\epsilon \\) Precisely:** To see its impact on \\( m \\).\n\nSince ignoring small terms simplified the earlier calculations but might be leading to inconsistencies, perhaps I should calculate \\( \\epsilon \\) more carefully.\n\n---\n\n**Step 11: Calculating \\( \\epsilon \\) for Small \\( n \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s calculate \\( \\epsilon \\) for smaller \\( n \\) to see its impact.\n\n**Case: \\( n = 3 \\)**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{3 \\times 9} = \\frac{1}{27} \\approx 0.037\n\\]\n\nCheck if \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{27} \\approx 0.037 > \\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't satisfy the condition \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\). So, \\( n = 3 \\) doesn't work.\n\n**Case: \\( n = 4 \\)**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{3 \\times 16} = \\frac{1}{48}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{48} \\approx 0.0208 > \\frac{1}{1000}\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\( r \\) is greater than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\), so \\( n = 4 \\) also doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nIt seems that for \\( n = 1 \\) to \\( n = 4 \\), \\( r \\) doesn't meet the requirement \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\). This suggests that the smallest \\( n \\) must be larger than 4.\n\n---\n\n**Step 12: Testing \\( n = 5 \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( n = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{3 \\times 25} = \\frac{1}{75}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{75} \\approx 0.0133 > \\frac{1}{1000}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( n = 5 \\) also doesn't work because \\( r \\) is still greater than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\).\n\nThis is getting annoying! It seems that I need to go up to higher \\( n \\) values to satisfy the condition.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\nPerhaps the smallest \\( n \\) is higher than 5, maybe around 10 or more. Let\u2019s test \\( n = 10 \\) again.\n\n---\n\n**Step 13: Re-testing \\( n = 10 \\)**\n\nWait, let's reconsider \\( n = 10 \\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{3 \\times 100} = \\frac{1}{300}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{300} \\approx 0.0033 < \\frac{1}{1000}\n\\]\n\nOh! That\u2019s a mistake. \\( \\frac{1}{300} \\) is actually greater than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\), so \\( n = 10 \\) doesn't work.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, based on this pattern, it seems that the condition \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\) is quite restrictive, and the smallest \\( n \\) might need to be significantly larger to meet this requirement.\n\nBut wait, are there any constraints I'm missing? Perhaps the way I'm calculating \\( r \\) needs to be adjusted.\n\n---\n\n**Step 14: Revisiting the Calculation**\n\nLet\u2019s reconsider how \\( r \\) is defined. The problem states that \\( r \\) is a positive real number less than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\). So, perhaps I should focus on ensuring that \\( 3n^2r < 1 \\) instead.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n3n^2r < 1 \\implies r < \\frac{1}{3n^2}\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3n^2} < \\frac{1}{1000} \\implies 3n^2 > 1000 \\implies n^2 > \\frac{1000}{3} \\approx 333.33\n\\]\n\\[\nn > \\sqrt{333.33} \\approx 18.26\n\\]\n\nSo, the smallest integer \\( n \\) that satisfies this is \\( n = 19 \\).\n\n**Thought Check:**\n\nWait, does this make sense? If \\( n = 19 \\), then:\n\n\\[\n3n^2 = 3 \\times 361 = 1083 > 1000\n\\]\n\nAnd:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{3n^2} = \\frac{1}{1083} \\approx 0.000923 < \\frac{1}{1000}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( r \\) is indeed less than \\( \\frac{1}{1000} \\), and \\( n = 19 \\) works.\n\n---\n\n**Step 15: Final Calculation of \\( m \\)**\n\nNow, let's calculate \\( m \\) for \\( n = 19 \\) and \\( r = \\frac{1}{3 \\times 19^2} = \\frac{1}{1083} \\).\n\n\\[\nm = 19^3 + 3 \\times 19^2 \\times r + 3 \\times 19 \\times r^2 + r^3\n\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n\\[\n19^3 = 6859\n\\]\n\\[\n3 \\times 19^2 = 1083\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{1083}\n\\]\n\\[\n3 \\times 19 \\times r^2 = 3 \\times 19 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1083}\\right)^2 = 57 \\times \\frac{1}{1170969} \\approx 0.0000485\n\\]\n\\[\nr^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{1083}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{1260808134927} \\approx 7.93 \\times 10^{-13}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nm = 6859 + 1 + 0.0000485 + 7.93 \\times 10^{-13} \\approx 6860.0000485\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, this seems odd. The integer part of \\( m \\) is 6860, which is quite large. I thought the smallest \\( m \\) might be closer to \\( n^3 \\). Maybe I should double-check the calculations or see if there's a simpler way to approach this.\n\nBut given that \\( n \\) needs to be at least 19 to satisfy the conditions, perhaps \\( m \\) is indeed larger than initially expected.\n\n---\n\n**Step 16: Verifying the Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s verify if the approach makes sense:\n\n1. **Constraint Satisfaction:** \\( n = 19 \\) ensures \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\).\n2. **Calculation Consistency:** The terms involving \\( r \\) are very small compared to \\( n^3 \\), so they don\u2019t significantly affect the integer part of \\( m \\).\n\nGiven these, the approach seems valid.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nThe key is that while \\( m \\) might seem large, it's the smallest integer that satisfies the cube root condition with \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\).\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe smallest integer \\( m \\) whose cube root is of the form \\( n + r \\), with \\( n \\) a positive integer and \\( r < \\frac{1}{1000} \\), is when \\( n = 19 \\).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy carefully considering the constraints and calculating \\( m \\) step by step, we determined that the smallest \\( n \\) satisfying the condition is 19. While the initial approach led to some confusion, reflecting and re-evaluating the strategy helped clarify the solution.\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding the thought process behind solving such problems.
