Let's dive into this problem, mimicking a human's thought process with brainstorming, checking, reflecting, and adjusting strategies as we go along.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem involves three math teams with different numbers of students, each having two co-captains. We're asked to find the probability that both selected members from a randomly chosen team are co-captains when selecting two members to receive a book.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Selection Process:** It seems like a multi-step random selection: first selecting a team, then selecting two members within that team.\n- **Probability Concept:** This reminds me of probability problems involving combinations, where we need to find the favorable outcomes over the total possible outcomes.\n- **Co-Captains' Role:** The co-captains are specifically mentioned, so it feels important to account for their presence in the total number of ways to select two members.\n\n**Uncertainty:**\n\n- **Different Team Sizes:** Each team has a different number of members, which might complicate the probability calculations.\n- **Random Selection:** Both the team and the members within it are selected randomly, adding layers to the probability.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nLet's explore different strategies to tackle this:\n\n1. **Total Probability Approach:** Calculate the probability for each team and then average them since any team could be selected with equal likelihood.\n   \n2. **Conditional Probability:** Consider selecting a team and then finding the probability that both selected members are co-captains within that team.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Approach:** Use combinations to determine the number of favorable outcomes versus the total possible outcomes for each team.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Total Probability Approach** seems straightforward since each team selection is independent.\n- **Conditional Probability** might complicate things because we have to consider each team's unique size and number of co-captains.\n- **Combinatorial Approach** aligns well with probability problems involving selecting specific members, so it feels promising.\n\nI think starting with the **Combinatorial Approach** will be helpful, as it directly relates to calculating probabilities involving specific member selections.\n\n### **Step 1: Define Total Probability**\n\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities of selecting two co-captains from each team, weighted by the probability of selecting that team.\n\n**Formula Setup:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both are co-captains}) = P(\\text{Team A}) \\times P(\\text{both are co-captains from Team A}) + P(\\text{Team B}) \\times P(\\text{both are co-captains from Team B}) + P(\\text{Team C}) \\times P(\\text{both are co-captains from Team C})\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Each team has an equal probability of being selected since the selection is random.\n- Therefore, \\(P(\\text{Team A}) = P(\\text{Team B}) = P(\\text{Team C}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems logical because the problem states that a team is selected randomly, implying equal likelihoods.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Probability for Each Team**\n\nLet's dive into each team's probability of selecting two co-captains.\n\n#### **Team A with 5 Members**\n\n**Given:**\n- Total members: 5\n- Co-captains: 2\n\n**Calculate Total Ways to Select 2 Members:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Calculate Favorable Ways to Select Both Co-Captains:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable ways} = \\binom{2}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Probability:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both are co-captains from Team A}) = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10} = 0.1\n\\]\n\nSeems reasonable.\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\n- There\u2019s only one way to select both co-captains out of ten possible combinations.\n- This low probability makes sense given the small number of members relative to the total possible pairs.\n\n#### **Team B with 7 Members**\n\n**Given:**\n- Total members: 7\n- Co-captains: 2\n\n**Calculate Total Ways to Select 2 Members:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n\\]\n\n**Calculate Favorable Ways:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable ways} = \\binom{2}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Probability:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both are co-captains from Team B}) = \\frac{1}{21}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{21} \\approx 0.0476\n\\]\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\n- Again, there's only one favorable outcome out of twenty-one possible combinations.\n- The probability is even lower here, which aligns with there being more total members and only two being co-captains.\n\n#### **Team C with 8 Members**\n\n**Given:**\n- Total members: 8\n- Co-captains: 2\n\n**Calculate Total Ways to Select 2 Members:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\n**Calculate Favorable Ways:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable ways} = \\binom{2}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Probability:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both are co-captains from Team C}) = \\frac{1}{28}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{28} \\approx 0.0357\n\\]\n\n#### **Thoughts:**\n- With more members, the number of possible combinations increases, reducing the probability further.\n- Again, only one favorable outcome, which seems consistent with the increasing team size.\n\n### **Step 3: Total Probability Calculation**\n\nNow, let's plug these probabilities into our initial formula:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both are co-captains}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{21} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{28}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{21} + \\frac{1}{28}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Find a Common Denominator:**\n\nThe least common multiple of 10, 21, and 28 is 420.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{42}{420}, \\quad \\frac{1}{21} = \\frac{20}{420}, \\quad \\frac{1}{28} = \\frac{15}{420}\n\\]\n\n**Add Them Up:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{42}{420} + \\frac{20}{420} + \\frac{15}{420} = \\frac{77}{420}\n\\]\n\n**Simplify:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{77}{420} \\div 7 = \\frac{11}{60}\n\\]\n\n**Final Probability:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both are co-captains}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{11}{60} = \\frac{11}{180}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{180} \\approx 0.0611\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\n- The final probability seems reasonable given the low likelihood of randomly selecting both co-captains from a larger team.\n- The step-by-step addition using a common denominator ensures accuracy in the probability calculation.\n\n### **Step 4: Double-Checking the Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Does the strategy make sense?** Yes, calculating the probability for each team individually and then averaging them is logical since the team selection is random and independent.\n  \n- **Is there an alternative method?** While conditional probability could be explored, it would complicate the calculations without adding value. The combinatorial approach directly addresses the problem's requirements.\n  \n- **Are the intermediate calculations correct?** Checking each team's probability and ensuring the fractions were properly added and simplified confirms the correctness.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter thoroughly exploring strategies, reflecting on each step, and carefully checking calculations, the probability that both selected members are co-captains is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{11}{180}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nBy mimicking a human thought process, we've ensured the problem was tackled methodically, considering multiple strategies, checking for correctness at each step, and adjusting the approach as needed.",
