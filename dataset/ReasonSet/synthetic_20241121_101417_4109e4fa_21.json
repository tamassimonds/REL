  "problem": "Cindy wishes to arrange her coins into $X$ piles, each consisting of the same number of coins, $Y$. Each pile will have more than one coin and no pile will have all the coins. If there are 13 possible values for $Y$ given all of the restrictions, what is the smallest number of coins she could have?",
  "solution": "---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. Cindy wants to arrange her coins into \\( X \\) piles, each with \\( Y \\) coins. The conditions are:\n\n1. Each pile has more than one coin.\n2. No pile contains all the coins.\n3. There are 13 possible values for \\( Y \\) given these restrictions.\n\n**Goal:** Find the smallest number of coins she could have.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, okay. This looks like a problem involving factors or divisors since arranging coins into equal piles usually relates to divisibility. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Maybe exploring multiple strategies could help. Let's brainstorm a few approaches:\n\n1. **List Possible Values for \\( Y \\):** Identify what \\( Y \\) can be based on the number of coins.\n2. **Use Factors and Divisors:** Since \\( Y \\) must divide the total number of coins, perhaps finding the number's divisors could lead us to the solution.\n3. **Determine the Total Number of Coins \\( N \\):** Maybe by finding \\( N \\) that has exactly 13 suitable divisors.\n\nI think starting with the second approach makes sense\u2014using factors and divisors. If that doesn't work, we can pivot to other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: List Possible \\( Y \\) Values**\n\n**Step 1: Brainstorming**\n\nLet's suppose Cindy has \\( N \\) coins. To have \\( Y \\) coins per pile, \\( Y \\) must be a divisor of \\( N \\). Additionally, \\( Y \\) must be greater than 1 and less than \\( N \\). So, we're looking for divisors of \\( N \\) excluding 1 and \\( N \\) itself.\n\nBut wait, I realize this might be too vague. Listing possible \\( Y \\) values without knowing \\( N \\) seems tricky. Maybe this isn't the best starting point.\n\n**Reflection**\n\nOkay, maybe listing \\( Y \\) values isn't leading me anywhere concrete. I need a different angle. Let's move on to the next strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Use Factors and Divisors**\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorming**\n\nGiven that \\( Y \\) must be a divisor of \\( N \\) (the total number of coins), and there are 13 possible values for \\( Y \\), it implies that \\( N \\) has exactly 15 divisors (including 1 and \\( N \\) itself).\n\nWhy 15? Because:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of divisors} = 13\\ (\\text{possible } Y \\text{ values}) + 2\\ (1 \\text{ and } N) = 15\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**\n\nThis makes sense. If \\( N \\) has 15 divisors, excluding 1 and \\( N \\), there are 13 possible \\( Y \\) values. Now, the challenge is to find the smallest \\( N \\) with exactly 15 divisors.\n\n**Step 3: Determining \\( N \\) with 15 Divisors**\n\nTo find the smallest \\( N \\) with exactly 15 divisors, I need to recall how to calculate the number of divisors based on the prime factorization of a number.\n\nIf \\( N \\) is prime factorized as:\n\n\\[\nN = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{a_k}\n\\]\n\nThen, the total number of divisors \\( D \\) is:\n\n\\[\nD = (a_1 + 1) \\times (a_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots \\times (a_k + 1)\n\\]\n\nWe need \\( D = 15 \\).\n\n**Step 4: Factoring 15**\n\nLet's break down 15 into factors to determine possible combinations of exponents:\n\n- \\( 15 = 15 \\times 1 \\)\n- \\( 15 = 5 \\times 3 \\)\n- \\( 15 = 3 \\times 5 \\)\n- \\( 15 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 1 \\)\n\nEach combination corresponds to different prime factorizations of \\( N \\).\n\n**Reflection**\n\nThis approach seems promising. By exploring different combinations, I can identify the smallest \\( N \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Applying Strategy 2: Different Combinations**\n\n**Case 1: \\( D = 15 \\times 1 \\)**\n\n- **Prime Factorization:** \\( N = p_1^{14} \\)\n- **Smallest \\( N \\):** Using the smallest prime, \\( p_1 = 2 \\)\n\n\\[\nN = 2^{14} = 16,384\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**\n\nWait a minute, 16,384 is a massive number. Considering this problem, it seems too large to be practical. Maybe there's a more efficient combination. Let's try another.\n\n**Case 2: \\( D = 5 \\times 3 \\)**\n\n- **Prime Factorization:** \\( N = p_1^4 \\times p_2^2 \\)\n- **Smallest \\( N \\):** Using the smallest primes, \\( p_1 = 2 \\) and \\( p_2 = 3 \\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nN &= 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\\\\n  &= 16 \\times 9 \\\\\n  &= 144 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**\n\nThis seems more reasonable. Let's verify if \\( N = 144 \\) has exactly 15 divisors.\n\n---\n\n### **Verification: Does \\( N = 144 \\) Have 15 Divisors?**\n\n**Step 5: Finding Divisors of 144**\n\nLet's list the divisors of 144:\n\n\\[\n1,\\ 2,\\ 3,\\ 4,\\ 6,\\ 8,\\ 9,\\ 12,\\ 16,\\ 18,\\ 24,\\ 36,\\ 48,\\ 72,\\ 144\n\\]\n\nCounting these, there are 15 divisors.\n\n**Reflection**\n\nPerfect! Out of these, excluding 1 and 144, there are exactly 13 possible values for \\( Y \\). This aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategies: Just to Be Sure**\n\n**Step 6: Brainstorming**\n\nIs there another way to confirm that 144 is the smallest \\( N \\)? Maybe by considering different combinations of prime factorizations or using a different set of primes.\n\n**Case 3: \\( D = 3 \\times 3 \\times 1 \\)**\n\n- **Prime Factorization:** \\( N = p_1^2 \\times p_2^2 \\times p_3^0 \\)\n- **Smallest \\( N \\):** Using the smallest primes, \\( p_1 = 2 \\) and \\( p_2 = 3 \\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nN &= 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\\\\n  &= 4 \\times 9 \\\\\n  &= 36 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**\n\nBut wait, let's check how many divisors 36 has:\n\nDivisors of 36: \\( 1,\\ 2,\\ 3,\\ 4,\\ 6,\\ 9,\\ 12,\\ 18,\\ 36 \\) \u2014 Only 9 divisors.\n\nThis doesn't meet the requirement of having 15 divisors. So, \\( N = 36 \\) is too small.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven the alternative case doesn't satisfy the conditions, \\( N = 144 \\) remains the smallest number with exactly 15 divisors.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER> solution  \nCindy could have **144** coins.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Checking**\n\n- **Does \\( N = 144 \\) have exactly 15 divisors?**  \n  Yes, we've listed them, and there are 15.\n\n- **Are there 13 possible values for \\( Y \\) (excluding 1 and 144)?**  \n  Yes, the remaining divisors are exactly 13.\n\n- **Is 144 the smallest number satisfying these conditions?**  \n  Yes, as exploring smaller \\( N \\) resulted in fewer divisors.\n\nEverything checks out, so **144** is indeed the correct and smallest number of coins Cindy could have.\n\n**Extra Step: Cross-Verification**\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another combination:\n\n**Case 4: \\( D = 3 \\times 5 \\)**\n\n- **Prime Factorization:** \\( N = p_1^2 \\times p_2^4 \\)\n- **Smallest \\( N \\):** Using the smallest primes, \\( p_1 = 2 \\) and \\( p_2 = 3 \\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nN &= 2^2 \\times 3^4 \\\\\n  &= 4 \\times 81 \\\\\n  &= 324 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**\n\n\\( N = 324 \\) is larger than 144, and since we're seeking the smallest \\( N \\), this confirms that 144 is indeed the smallest number satisfying all conditions.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies and verifying each step, we've confidently determined that Cindy could have **144** coins to meet all the given conditions.\n\n<ANSWER> solution  \nCindy could have **144** coins.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "If Cindy has $n$ coins, then the possible values for $Y$ are the proper factors of $n$ (recall that a proper factor of $n$ is a factor other than 1 or $n$).  Since there are 13 possible values of $Y$, there are $13+2=15$ factors of $n$.  Our goal is to find the least value of $n$ with exactly 15 factors.  Recall that we can determine the number of positive integer factors of $n$ by prime factorizing $n$, adding 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization, and multiplying the results.  The sets of exponents which would give rise to 15 factors are $\\{14\\}$ and $\\{2,4\\}$.  The least positive integer whose prime factorization has an exponent of 14 is $2^{14}$.  The least positive integer whose prime factorization has exponents 2 and 4 is obtained by assigning these exponents in decreasing order to the smallest two primes, which yields $2^4\\cdot 3^2=144$.  The smaller of these two numbers is 144, so Cindy has $\\boxed{144}$ coins."
