  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by systematically working through different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and ultimately arriving at the correct solution. Here's how I approached it:\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Brainstorming**\n\nAt first glance, the equation involves trigonometric functions:\n\n\\[\n\\sec x + \\tan x = \\frac{22}{7}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) in its simplest form and then determine \\(m + n\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- This reminds me of identities involving secant and tangent, as well as cosecant and cotangent.\n- Maybe I can use Pythagorean identities or reciprocal relationships to connect them.\n- I'm not entirely sure which path to take, so exploring different strategies might help.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use Trigonometric Identities:**\n   - Utilize identities like \\(\\sec^2 x - \\tan^2 x = 1\\).\n\n2. **Express in Terms of Sine and Cosine:**\n   - Convert everything to sine and cosine to see if simplification is possible.\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:**\n   - Square both sides to exploit relationships between secant, tangent, cosecant, and cotangent.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I think starting with trigonometric identities could be promising. If that doesn't work, I'll consider expressing everything in terms of sine and cosine.\n\n---\n\n### **First Approach: Using Trigonometric Identities**\n\n**Step 1: Recall Relevant Identity**\n\nThe identity \\(\\sec^2 x - \\tan^2 x = 1\\) comes to mind. Since we have \\(\\sec x + \\tan x\\), maybe squaring both sides will help.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If I square both sides, I can introduce \\(\\sec^2 x\\) and \\(\\tan^2 x\\), which are related by the identity.\n- This might lead to a simpler expression.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(\\sec x + \\tan x)^2 = \\left(\\frac{22}{7}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\sec^2 x + 2\\sec x \\tan x + \\tan^2 x = \\frac{484}{49}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait a minute, I see \\(\\sec^2 x + \\tan^2 x\\) here. Let's use the identity.\n\n**Substitution:**\n\n\\[\n\\sec^2 x - \\tan^2 x = 1\n\\]\n\nBut we have \\(\\sec^2 x + \\tan^2 x\\), so let's rearrange:\n\n\\[\n(\\sec^2 x + \\tan^2 x) - 2\\tan^2 x = 1 \\implies \\sec^2 x = 1 + \\tan^2 x\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\tan^2 x) + \\tan^2 x = \\frac{484}{49} - 2\\sec x \\tan x\n\\]\n\n**Wait, That Doesn't Seem Right:**\n\n- Hmm, I'm making it more complicated than it needs to be. Maybe squaring both sides isn't the best approach here.\n- Let's backtrack and try a different method.\n\n---\n\n### **Second Approach: Expressing in Terms of Sine and Cosine**\n\n**Step 2: Express \\(\\sec x\\) and \\(\\tan x\\) in Terms of Sine and Cosine**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}, \\quad \\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sec x + \\tan x = \\frac{1 + \\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\frac{22}{7}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This looks like a rational equation. Maybe I can solve for \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\).\n- But wait, I have two variables here. Is there a way to relate them?\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(\\cos x\\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\sin x = \\frac{22}{7} \\cos x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Now I have an equation with \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\). Perhaps I can square both sides to use the Pythagorean identity.\n\n**Possible Next Step:**\n\n- Squaring both sides could lead to a quadratic in terms of sine or cosine, which might be tricky.\n\n**Wait, That Might Get Messy:**\n\n- Squaring both sides could lead to a complex equation. Maybe there's a better way.\n\n**New Idea:**\n\n- Instead of solving for \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) directly, maybe I can find \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) by manipulating the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Third Approach: Finding \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) Directly**\n\n**Step 3: Express \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) in Terms of \\(\\sec x\\) and \\(\\tan x\\)**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n\\csc x = \\frac{1}{\\sin x}, \\quad \\cot x = \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\csc x + \\cot x = \\frac{1 + \\cos x}{\\sin x}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Can I relate \\(\\frac{1 + \\cos x}{\\sin x}\\) to \\(\\sec x + \\tan x\\)?\n- Maybe I can use identities to connect them.\n\n**Exploring the Relationship:**\n\nFrom the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sec x + \\tan x = \\frac{22}{7}\n\\]\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n\\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}, \\quad \\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sec x + \\tan x = \\frac{1 + \\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\frac{22}{7}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, this looks similar to \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\), but involving sine and cosine differently.\n- Maybe I can manipulate the equation to express \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) in terms of known quantities.\n\n**Idea: Use Reciprocal Identities**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n\\csc x = \\frac{1}{\\sin x}, \\quad \\cot x = \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\csc x + \\cot x = \\frac{1 + \\cos x}{\\sin x}\n\\]\n\n**Wait, how Can I Relate This to the Given Equation?**\n\n- Let me think. I have \\(\\sec x + \\tan x = \\frac{22}{7}\\).\n- Can I find a way to express \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) using \\(\\sec x\\) and \\(\\tan x\\)?\n\n**New Strategy: Express \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) in Terms of \\(\\sec x\\) and \\(\\tan x\\)**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\sec x + \\tan x = \\frac{22}{7}\n\\]\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n\\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}, \\quad \\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sec x + \\tan x = \\frac{1 + \\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\frac{22}{7}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Maybe I can multiply both sides by \\(\\cos x\\) to simplify.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n1 + \\sin x = \\frac{22}{7} \\cos x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Now, I need to express \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) in terms of \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\).\n- Let's see how I can manipulate this equation.\n\n**Idea: Square Both Sides to Use Pythagorean Identity**\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\sin x)^2 = \\left(\\frac{22}{7} \\cos x\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2\\sin x + \\sin^2 x = \\frac{484}{49} \\cos^2 x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Now, I can use the Pythagorean identity: \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\).\n- Substitute \\(\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x\\) into the equation.\n\n**Substitution:**\n\n\\[\n1 + 2\\sin x + (1 - \\cos^2 x) = \\frac{484}{49} \\cos^2 x\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n2 + 2\\sin x - \\cos^2 x = \\frac{484}{49} \\cos^2 x\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\n2\\sin x = \\frac{484}{49} \\cos^2 x + \\cos^2 x - 2\n\\]\n\n**Wait, This Is Getting Complicated:**\n\n- Hmm, this doesn't seem to be leading anywhere straightforward.\n- Maybe squaring both sides wasn't the best move.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I need to find a better way to relate \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) to \\(\\sec x + \\tan x\\).\n- Let's try a different approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Fourth Approach: Using Reciprocal Identities**\n\n**Step 4: Express \\(\\sec x + \\tan x\\) and \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) in Terms of Each Other**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n\\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}, \\quad \\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\sec x + \\tan x = \\frac{22}{7}\n\\]\n\nWhich means:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + \\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\frac{22}{7}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Similarly, \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) can be expressed in terms of \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\).\n- Let's see if we can find a relationship between the two expressions.\n\n**Express \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\csc x = \\frac{1}{\\sin x}, \\quad \\cot x = \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\csc x + \\cot x = \\frac{1 + \\cos x}{\\sin x}\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Moment:**\n\n- I have two separate expressions involving \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\).\n- Can I find a way to connect them?\n\n**New Idea: Multiply \\(\\sec x + \\tan x\\) and \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\)**\n\nLet's see what happens if I multiply the two expressions:\n\n\\[\n(\\sec x + \\tan x)(\\csc x + \\cot x)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This might simplify to a known identity or lead to an expression involving \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) that we can solve.\n- It's worth trying to see if it leads us closer to the solution.\n\n**Expansion:**\n\n\\[\n(\\sec x + \\tan x)(\\csc x + \\cot x) = (\\sec x \\cdot \\csc x) + (\\sec x \\cdot \\cot x) + (\\tan x \\cdot \\csc x) + (\\tan x \\cdot \\cot x)\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Each Term:**\n\n\\[\n\\sec x \\cdot \\csc x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sin x} = \\frac{1}{\\sin x \\cos x}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sec x \\cdot \\cot x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x} \\cdot \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\frac{1}{\\sin x}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\tan x \\cdot \\csc x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sin x} = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\tan x \\cdot \\cot x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} \\cdot \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\n\\[\n(\\sec x + \\tan x)(\\csc x + \\cot x) = \\frac{1}{\\sin x \\cos x} + \\frac{1}{\\sin x} + \\frac{1}{\\cos x} + 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This expression looks complicated, but maybe there's a way to simplify it further.\n- Perhaps I can find a common denominator or use identities to combine terms.\n\n**Wait, This Is Getting Messy:**\n\n- Multiplying the expressions didn't simplify as much as I hoped.\n- It seems like this approach might not be the most efficient.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Multiplying \\(\\sec x + \\tan x\\) and \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) isn't leading to a straightforward solution.\n- I need to think of a different strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Fifth Approach: Using Reciprocal Relationships**\n\n**Step 5: Express \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) in Terms of \\(\\sec x + \\tan x\\)**\n\nLet's see if we can relate \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) directly to \\(\\sec x + \\tan x\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Recall that \\(\\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}\\) and \\(\\csc x = \\frac{1}{\\sin x}\\).\n- Similarly, \\(\\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\) and \\(\\cot x = \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\).\n- Maybe I can find a relationship between these expressions that will help me solve the problem.\n\n**Idea: Use Complementary Angles**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n\\sec(\\pi/2 -
