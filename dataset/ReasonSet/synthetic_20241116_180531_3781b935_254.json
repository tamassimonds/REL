    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I would approach it if I were working on it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's start by thoroughly understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**User's Query:** \n\nCall an integer \\( n \\) *oddly powerful* if there exist positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), where \\( b > 1 \\), \\( b \\) is odd, and \\( a^b = n \\). How many oddly powerful integers are less than \\( 2010 \\)?\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The term \"oddly powerful\" pops out. It reminds me of integers expressed as odd powers, similar to perfect squares but with odd exponents.\n- I see \\( a \\) must be a positive integer, and \\( b \\) must be an odd integer greater than 1. This constrains the types of powers we're dealing with.\n- The goal is to find all such integers \\( n \\) less than \\( 2010 \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** List all odd powers of integers \\( a \\) where \\( a^b < 2010 \\) and \\( b \\) is odd.\n- **Strategy 2:** Consider the highest possible integer \\( a \\) such that \\( a^3 < 2010 \\) since higher odd exponents grow quickly.\n- **Strategy 3:** Check for overlaps; for instance, \\( a^3 \\) and \\( a^5 \\) might both yield different \\( n \\) values for the same \\( a \\).\n\n**Initial Reflection:**\n\n- **Listing Powers:** This seems straightforward but could get cumbersome if \\( a \\) is large.\n- **Upper Bound Calculation:** Thinking about the largest \\( a \\) with \\( a^3 < 2010 \\) might help limit the range.\n- **Checking Overlaps:** Important to ensure unique counts; perhaps using a set to store results could help.\n\nAlright, I think starting with Strategy 1\u2014listing all relevant odd powers\u2014would be a good starting point. If it gets messy, I'll reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Implementing Strategy 1 \u2013 Listing Odd Powers**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- I'll calculate \\( a^b \\) for odd \\( b \\) (starting from 3) and increasing \\( a \\) until \\( a^b \\) exceeds \\( 2010 \\).\n- I need to ensure \\( b \\) remains odd and greater than 1.\n- To avoid duplicate counts, I'll keep track of all unique \\( n \\) values in a set.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's start with \\( b = 3 \\) and increase \\( a \\):\n\n1. **For \\( b = 3 \\):**\n   - \\( a = 1 \\): \\( 1^3 = 1 \\)\n   - \\( a = 2 \\): \\( 2^3 = 8 \\)\n   - \\( a = 3 \\): \\( 3^3 = 27 \\)\n   - \\( a = 4 \\): \\( 4^3 = 64 \\)\n   - \\( a = 5 \\): \\( 5^3 = 125 \\)\n   - \\( a = 6 \\): \\( 6^3 = 216 \\)\n   - \\( a = 7 \\): \\( 7^3 = 343 \\)\n   - \\( a = 8 \\): \\( 8^3 = 512 \\)\n   - \\( a = 9 \\): \\( 9^3 = 729 \\)\n   - \\( a = 10 \\): \\( 10^3 = 1000 \\)\n   - \\( a = 11 \\): \\( 11^3 = 1331 \\)\n   - \\( a = 12 \\): \\( 12^3 = 1728 \\)\n   - \\( a = 13 \\): \\( 13^3 = 2197 \\) (exceeds 2010)\n\n*Stop here for \\( b = 3 \\) as \\( a = 13 \\) exceeds 2010.*\n\n2. **For \\( b = 5 \\):**\n   - \\( a = 1 \\): \\( 1^5 = 1 \\) (already counted)\n   - \\( a = 2 \\): \\( 2^5 = 32 \\)\n   - \\( a = 3 \\): \\( 3^5 = 243 \\)\n   - \\( a = 4 \\): \\( 4^5 = 1024 \\)\n   - \\( a = 5 \\): \\( 5^5 = 3125 \\) (exceeds 2010)\n\n*Stop here for \\( b = 5 \\) as \\( a = 5 \\) exceeds 2010.*\n\n3. **For \\( b = 7 \\):**\n   - \\( a = 1 \\): \\( 1^7 = 1 \\) (already counted)\n   - \\( a = 2 \\): \\( 2^7 = 128 \\)\n   - \\( a = 3 \\): \\( 3^7 = 2187 \\) (exceeds 2010)\n\n*Stop here for \\( b = 7 \\) as \\( a = 3 \\) exceeds 2010.*\n\n4. **Continue with higher odd \\( b \\):**\n   - **\\( b = 9 \\):** \n     - \\( a = 1 \\): \\( 1^9 = 1 \\) (already counted)\n     - \\( a = 2 \\): \\( 2^9 = 512 \\)\n     - \\( a = 3 \\): \\( 3^9 = 19683 \\) (exceeds 2010)\n\n   - **\\( b = 11 \\):**\n     - \\( a = 1 \\): \\( 1^{11} = 1 \\) (already counted)\n     - \\( a = 2 \\): \\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\) (exceeds 2010)\n\n**Interim Check:**\n- So far, the oddly powerful integers less than 2010 from \\( b = 3 \\) to \\( b = 9 \\) are: \n  \\( 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1331, 1728, 32, 243, 1024, 128, 512 \\)\n\n- But wait, **512** is duplicated from both \\( b = 9 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\) with \\( a = 8 \\) and \\( a = 2 \\) respectively. This suggests overlapping counts.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Duplicate Check:** I need to ensure uniqueness. Using a set to store these numbers would be beneficial to automatically handle duplicates.\n- **Alternative Thoughts:** Maybe sorting the results and removing duplicates afterward could work, but using a set from the beginning seems cleaner.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 2:**\n- The initial list contains duplicates. To proceed accurately, I should store these in a set to ensure each oddly powerful integer is counted only once.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Refining the Approach \u2013 Using a Set for Uniqueness**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Instead of listing in a simple array, I'll use a set to store all uniquely oddly powerful integers.\n- This will automatically handle duplicates, making the final count more straightforward.\n\n**Recalculations:**\n\nLet's repeat the previous calculations but store results in a set to avoid duplicates.\n\n1. **For \\( b = 3 \\):**\n   - \\( a = 1 \\): \\( 1^3 = 1 \\)\n   - \\( a = 2 \\): \\( 2^3 = 8 \\)\n   - \\( a = 3 \\): \\( 3^3 = 27 \\)\n   - \\( a = 4 \\): \\( 4^3 = 64 \\)\n   - \\( a = 5 \\): \\( 5^3 = 125 \\)\n   - \\( a = 6 \\): \\( 6^3 = 216 \\)\n   - \\( a = 7 \\): \\( 7^3 = 343 \\)\n   - \\( a = 8 \\): \\( 8^3 = 512 \\)\n   - \\( a = 9 \\): \\( 9^3 = 729 \\)\n   - \\( a = 10 \\): \\( 10^3 = 1000 \\)\n   - \\( a = 11 \\): \\( 11^3 = 1331 \\)\n   - \\( a = 12 \\): \\( 12^3 = 1728 \\)\n\n2. **For \\( b = 5 \\):**\n   - \\( a = 1 \\): \\( 1^5 = 1 \\) (already in set)\n   - \\( a = 2 \\): \\( 2^5 = 32 \\)\n   - \\( a = 3 \\): \\( 3^5 = 243 \\)\n   - \\( a = 4 \\): \\( 4^5 = 1024 \\)\n\n3. **For \\( b = 7 \\):**\n   - \\( a = 1 \\): \\( 1^7 = 1 \\) (already in set)\n   - \\( a = 2 \\): \\( 2^7 = 128 \\)\n\n4. **For \\( b = 9 \\):**\n   - \\( a = 1 \\): \\( 1^9 = 1 \\) (already in set)\n   - \\( a = 2 \\): \\( 2^9 = 512 \\) (already in set)\n\n**Results in the Set:**\n- After processing all relevant \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the unique oddly powerful integers less than 2010 are:\n  \\( 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1331, 1728, 32, 243, 1024, 128 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Success with Uniqueness:** Using a set worked well to remove duplicates. Now each oddly powerful integer is counted only once.\n- **Alternative Check:** To be extra sure, I could sort the set and manually check for duplicates, but since sets inherently manage uniqueness, I trust the result.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 3:**\n- The final list contains all uniquely oddly powerful integers less than 2010 without duplicates. This makes it easier to count them accurately.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Counting the Oddly Powerful Integers**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Now that we have a set of unique oddly powerful integers, the next step is to simply count how many there are.\n\n**Counting:**\n- Let's list the numbers in ascending order to make sure we haven't missed any and to ensure accuracy in counting.\n\n**Sorted List:**\n- \\( 1, 8, 27, 32, 64, 125, 128, 216, 243, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1024, 1331, 1728 \\)\n\n*Total Count: 16*\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Final Check:** There are 16 uniquely oddly powerful integers less than 2010. This number seems reasonable given the constraints.\n- **Validation:** I could double-check by ensuring each number in the list can be expressed as \\( a^b \\) with \\( b \\) odd and \\( a \\) greater than 1, but given the systematic approach, I trust the result.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 4:**\n- The total number of oddly powerful integers less than 2010 is **16**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n**Reassessing the Approach:**\n- Initially, I started by listing all odd powers manually, which led to duplicate counts. Realizing this, I refined the approach by using a set to ensure uniqueness.\n- This adjustment streamlined the process and ensured accurate counting.\n\n**Alternative Strategies Considered:**\n- **Listing Powers and Using a Set:** This combination worked well to handle duplicates and ensured all oddly powerful integers were accounted for.\n- **Upper Bound Calculation:** Initially thought it might help limit the range, but focusing on listing odd powers was more direct.\n- **Checking Overlaps:** Using a set negated the need for separate overlap checks, simplifying the process.\n\n**Mistakes and Adjustments:**\n- **Duplicate Counts:** Caught early in the process, leading to the decision to use a set for uniqueness.\n- **Initial Strategy Change:** Shifted from a simple listing to a more structured approach using sets, which proved effective.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- By brainstorming different strategies and being open to adjusting the approach, I was able to accurately determine that there are **16** oddly powerful integers less than 2010.\n- Reflecting frequently ensured that any potential errors were caught early, leading to a correct and efficient solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThere are **16** oddly powerful integers less than **2010**.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed step-by-step reflection mimics a natural human thought process, complete with brainstorming, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed!",

  "ground_truth": "Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$. We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$. So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010. Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \\boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$."
