    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll take you through my thought process step-by-step, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were tackling this problem myself.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n> \"An assortment of 200 pencils is sold through a catalog for $19.90. Shipping is an additional $6.95. Including the charges for both the pencils and the shipping, what is the average cost, in cents, for each pencil? Express your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.\"\n\nMy initial reaction is to break down the total cost into two parts: the cost of the pencils and the shipping. That seems straightforward. But then I'm asked for the average cost **per pencil**, which makes me think that maybe I need to consider the total number of pencils in relation to the overall cost.\n\nI remember that calculating averages typically involves dividing the total amount by the number of items. So, perhaps I need to find the total cost (pencils + shipping) and then divide by 200 to get the average cost per pencil.\n\nBut wait\u2014before jumping in, let's brainstorm:\n\n- **Option 1:** Add the cost of the pencils and shipping, then divide by the number of pencils.\n- **Option 2:** Calculate the average cost per pencil by considering only the pencil cost divided by 200, then add the average shipping cost per pencil.\n- **Option 3:** Directly calculate the total average cost per pencil including both pencils and shipping in one step.\n\nOption 1 seems the most straightforward: find the total cost and divide by the number of pencils. But maybe Option 2 could provide insight into how shipping affects the average cost per pencil. Let's see how Option 1 works first, and if it doesn't feel right, I'll explore Option 2.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Total Cost**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI decide to start with Option 1 because it's the simplest\u2014adding the pencil cost and shipping together to get the total cost.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nTotal Cost = Cost of Pencils + Shipping Cost  \nTotal Cost = $19.90 + $6.95  \nTotal Cost = $26.85\n\n**Check:**\nDoes adding these two numbers make sense? Yes, $19.90 + $6.95 equals $26.85. That seems correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Average Cost per Pencil**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I'll take the total cost and divide it by the number of pencils to find the average cost per pencil. This aligns with calculating an average.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nAverage Cost per Pencil = Total Cost / Number of Pencils  \nAverage Cost per Pencil = $26.85 / 200  \nAverage Cost per Pencil = $0.13425\n\n**Check:**\nWait a second\u2014$0.13425 doesn't seem like a round number in cents. Since the question asks for the average cost **rounded to the nearest whole number in cents**, I need to convert dollars to cents first.\n\n**Reflection:**\nMaybe I should have converted the dollar amounts to cents before calculating the average. Let me adjust my approach to see if that makes it clearer.\n\n### **Option 2: Recalculating with Cents**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince the final answer needs to be in cents, let's convert everything to cents upfront. This might simplify the calculation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nCost of Pencils in Cents = $19.90 \u00d7 100 = 1990 cents  \nShipping Cost in Cents = $6.95 \u00d7 100 = 695 cents  \nTotal Cost in Cents = 1990 + 695 = 2685 cents  \n\nAverage Cost per Pencil = Total Cost in Cents / Number of Pencils  \nAverage Cost per Pencil = 2685 / 200  \nAverage Cost per Pencil = 13.425 cents\n\n**Check:**\nNow, looking at the average cost of 13.425 cents, this makes more sense. When rounding to the nearest whole number, it would be 13 cents. This aligns with the question's requirement to round to the nearest whole number in cents.\n\n**Reflection:**\nConverting everything to cents before performing the average calculation helped avoid confusion with dollar-to-cent conversion after finding the average. This approach feels more straightforward.\n\n### **Step 3: Rounding the Average Cost**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe average cost per pencil is 13.425 cents. Since we're asked to round to the nearest whole number, I need to round 13.425 to the nearest cent.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nRound 13.425 to the nearest whole number:  \n13.425 rounds up to 13.43 cents. However, since we're dealing with whole cents, it rounds to **13 cents**.\n\n**Check:**\nDoes rounding 13.425 to 13 cents make sense? Yes, since we're looking for the average cost in whole cents, rounding to 13 cents is appropriate.\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo the final answer is 13 cents. This matches the requirement to express the average cost in cents, rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's ensure that all steps align and that the logic holds throughout the process.\n\n**Check:**\n\n1. **Total Cost Calculation:**  \n   $19.90 + $6.95 = $26.85 \u2192 Correct\n\n2. **Average Cost Calculation:**  \n   $26.85 / 200 = $0.13425 \u2192 Converted to cents = 13.425 cents\n\n3. **Rounding:**  \n   13.425 cents rounded to the nearest whole number = 13 cents\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The total cost was calculated correctly, the average cost per pencil was determined by dividing the total cost in cents by the number of pencils, and the final rounding was appropriately handled. \n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter walking through different strategies, reflecting on each step, and ensuring all calculations align, the average cost per pencil, rounded to the nearest whole number, is **13 cents**.",

  "ground_truth": "The average cost per pencil is equal to the total cost divided by the number of pencils. The total cost is $19.90+6.95=26.85$ dollars, or 2685 cents, and there are 200 pencils. Thus, the average cost is $\\frac{2685}{200}\\approx\\boxed{13}$ cents."
