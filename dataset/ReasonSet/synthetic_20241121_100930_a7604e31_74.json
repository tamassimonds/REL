  "solution": "Sure! Let's put everything together into a coherent and complete solution, ensuring it flows naturally like a well-thought-out problem-solving process. I'll retain the final answer and all the essential insights while enhancing the narrative for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We're asked to determine the range of the function:\n\n\\[\nr(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is to figure out what values \\( r(x) \\) can take as \\( x \\) varies over its domain. I recall from calculus that finding the range involves understanding how the function behaves across all permissible \\( x \\)-values.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n- **Analyzing the Function's Behavior:** What happens to \\( r(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches certain critical points?\n- **Graphing the Function:** A visual representation might reveal patterns or asymptotes.\n- **Using Calculus Techniques:** Perhaps finding derivatives to identify extrema could help.\n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure which method will be the most straightforward, so let's explore each one briefly to see what insights they provide.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Analyzing the Denominator**\n\nLooking at the function, I see that the denominator is \\( (1-x)^2 \\). A few observations come to mind:\n\n- **Squaring Any Real Number:** Always yields a non-negative result.\n- **Denominator's Behavior:** It's always positive except when \\( (1-x) = 0 \\), i.e., \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- At \\( x = 1 \\), the denominator becomes zero, making \\( r(x) \\) undefined. This suggests a **vertical asymptote** at \\( x = 1 \\).\n- For all other \\( x \\neq 1 \\), the denominator is positive, so \\( r(x) \\) is always positive.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis tells me that \\( r(x) \\) is always positive and undefined at \\( x = 1 \\). It's a good starting point, but I still need to determine the range more precisely. Let's proceed to another strategy to gather more information.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Considering Limits**\n\nNext, I think about evaluating the limits of \\( r(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches certain critical points. This can provide insights into the function's behavior at boundaries and infinity.\n\n**Calculating Limits:**\n- **As \\( x \\to 1^- \\)** (approaching 1 from the left):\n  - \\( 1-x \\) approaches zero from the positive side.\n  - \\( (1-x)^2 \\) approaches zero.\n  - Therefore, \\( r(x) \\to +\\infty \\).\n\n- **As \\( x \\to 1^+ \\)** (approaching 1 from the right):\n  - \\( 1-x \\) approaches zero from the negative side, but squaring it makes it positive.\n  - So again, \\( r(x) \\to +\\infty \\).\n\n- **As \\( x \\to \\pm\\infty \\):**\n  - \\( 1-x \\) becomes very large (positive or negative).\n  - \\( (1-x)^2 \\) becomes very large positive.\n  - Therefore, \\( r(x) \\to 0^+ \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nFrom this, it seems like \\( r(x) \\) approaches infinity as \\( x \\) nears 1 and approaches zero as \\( x \\) goes to positive or negative infinity. This behavior suggests that the range is \\( (0, \\infty) \\), but I want to confirm this with another approach to ensure accuracy.\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Graphing the Function**\n\nMaybe visualizing the function will help solidify my understanding. I can sketch or use a graphing tool to see how \\( r(x) \\) behaves across its domain.\n\n**Graph Insights:**\n- The graph shows a **vertical asymptote** at \\( x = 1 \\).\n- As \\( x \\) moves away from 1 in either direction, \\( r(x) \\) decreases towards zero.\n- The function is **symmetric** about \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe graph aligns with my earlier observations. It confirms that \\( r(x) \\) takes on all positive values, approaching infinity near \\( x = 1 \\) and zero as \\( x \\) goes to infinity. This visual confirmation strengthens the idea that the range is \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n\n#### **Strategy 4: Calculus Approach**\n\nTo be thorough, let's use calculus to find any extrema (maxima or minima) within the domain. This will help verify whether there are any points where \\( r(x) \\) reaches specific values.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. **Find the First Derivative \\( r'(x) \\):**\n   \\[\n   r(x) = (1-x)^{-2}\n   \\]\n   Using the power rule:\n   \\[\n   r'(x) = -2(1-x)^{-3} \\cdot (-1) = \\frac{2}{(1-x)^3}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set \\( r'(x) = 0 \\) to Find Critical Points:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{(1-x)^3} = 0\n   \\]\n   This equation has no solution since the numerator is a constant (2) and cannot be zero.\n\n3. **Implications:**\n   - No critical points exist where the derivative is zero.\n   - This suggests that there are no local maxima or minima within the domain.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis calculus approach indicates that \\( r(x) \\) is monotonic within its domain, consistently decreasing as \\( x \\) moves away from the asymptote at \\( x = 1 \\). This aligns with our previous findings that the range is \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's revisit each strategy to ensure consistency and accuracy:\n\n- **Denominator Analysis:** Confirms \\( r(x) \\) is always positive and undefined at \\( x = 1 \\).\n- **Limit Evaluation:** Supports that \\( r(x) \\) approaches infinity near \\( x = 1 \\) and zero at infinity.\n- **Graphing:** Visually aligns with the analytical findings, showing the function's behavior across its domain.\n- **Calculus:** No critical points, indicating a monotonic decrease, reinforcing the range as \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n\nEverything checks out. All strategies lead to the same conclusion, providing a robust verification of the range.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\nThe range of the function \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\) is \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically exploring multiple strategies\u2014analyzing the denominator, evaluating limits, graphing the function, and applying calculus\u2014I was able to confidently determine that the range of \\( r(x) \\) includes all positive real numbers. Each method supported the others, providing a consistent and reliable answer.\n\nThroughout the process, reflecting on each step and checking for consistency ensured that the final conclusion was accurate. This approach mirrors a natural problem-solving workflow, where brainstorming, exploring, and verifying lead to a solid understanding and correct solution.\n\n---\n\nI hope this cohesive solution provides a clear and complete understanding of how to determine the range of the given function!",
  "ground_truth": "Every real number can be expressed in the form $1-x$ for some real $x$. Thus, as $x$ runs through the real numbers, $(1-x)^2$ runs through all nonnegative values, and its reciprocal (which is $r(x)$) runs through all positive values. The range of $r(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$."
