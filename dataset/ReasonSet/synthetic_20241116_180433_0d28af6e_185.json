Let's approach this problem step by step, thinking through various strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and checking our work frequently to ensure accuracy.\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\(x^2 + 10x + y^2 + 6y - k = 0\\), I recognize it involves both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) squared, which is typical for circles. Circles are usually represented in the form \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\nSo, the user wants to know what value of \\(k\\) makes this equation represent a circle with a radius of 6. This reminds me that when an equation is in the standard circle form, the radius can be directly identified from the equation.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Complete the Square:** Transform the given equation into the standard form of a circle by completing the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms. This should reveal the center and radius directly.\n   \n2. **Compare Coefficients:** Align the given equation with the standard circle equation to directly extract the radius.\n\n3. **General Circle Equation Knowledge:** Recall properties of circle equations and how constants affect the radius.\n\nHmm, completing the square seems like a solid starting point because it directly manipulates the equation into the desired form. However, I should also consider the second strategy as a check to see if they align.\n\n**Let\u2019s try the Complete the Square method first.**\n\n## **Step 2: Completing the Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo express the given equation in the standard form of a circle, I need to rearrange and complete the square for both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms. This should reveal the center and radius more clearly.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Group \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) Terms:**\n   \\[\n   (x^2 + 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) - k = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Complete the Square for \\(x\\) Terms:**\n   - Take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\): \\(\\frac{10}{2} = 5\\)\n   - Square it: \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n   \n   So, \\(x^2 + 10x\\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   (x^2 + 10x + 25) - 25 = (x + 5)^2 - 25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Complete the Square for \\(y\\) Terms:**\n   - Take half of the coefficient of \\(y\\): \\(\\frac{6}{2} = 3\\)\n   - Square it: \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n   \n   So, \\(y^2 + 6y\\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   (y^2 + 6y + 9) - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rewriting the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   ((x + 5)^2 - 25) + ((y + 3)^2 - 9) - k = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (x + 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 - k = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (x + 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = k + 34\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute, I see that the equation is now in the standard form \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where the right side \\((k + 34)\\) represents \\(r^2\\). Since we know the radius \\(r\\) is 6, let's compare:\n\n\\[\nr^2 = 6^2 = 36\n\\]\n\\[\nk + 34 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(k\\):**\n\n\\[\nk + 34 = 36 \\implies k = 36 - 34 = 2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me quickly verify: If \\(k = 2\\), the right side becomes \\(2 + 34 = 36\\), which matches \\(r^2 = 36\\). This seems correct.\n\n## **Step 3: Verifying with the Compare Coefficients Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's apply a different strategy: comparing coefficients directly with the standard circle equation. This serves as a check to confirm our previous result.\n\n**Steps:**\n\nThe standard form is:\n\\[\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\nOur manipulated equation is:\n\\[\n(x + 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = k + 34\n\\]\n\n**Comparing Coefficients:**\n\nFrom the standard form:\n- Center \\((h, k) = (-5, -3)\\)\n- Radius squared \\(r^2 = k + 34\\)\n\nGiven that the radius \\(r\\) is 6:\n\\[\nr^2 = 6^2 = 36\n\\]\n\\[\nk + 34 = 36\n\\]\n\\[\nk = 36 - 34 = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth methods yield \\(k = 2\\). This consistency reassures me that the solution is correct.\n\n## **Step 4: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does the equation represent a circle? Yes, because it's in the form \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\).\n- Is the radius 6? When \\(k = 2\\), the right side becomes \\(36\\), which matches \\(r^2 = 36\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe value of \\(k\\) for which the equation \\(x^2 + 10x + y^2 + 6y - k = 0\\) represents a circle with radius 6 is **\\(k = 2\\)**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Starting with completing the square provided a direct path to the answer. Comparing coefficients served as a valuable check, confirming the consistency of the result.\n- **Reflecting on Each Step:** Regularly checking if the manipulated form matched the standard circle equation ensured accuracy.\n- **Embracing Mistakes:** If the initial approach hadn't worked out, revisiting the brainstorming phase to consider alternative methods would have been essential.\n\nOverall, thinking through each step, reflecting on the process, and verifying the results led to a confident and correct solution.",
