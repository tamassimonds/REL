    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure to check my work often to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's begin by understanding the question thoroughly.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Tripling Dimensions:** Okay, so the picture's dimensions are tripled. That sounds straightforward\u2014just multiply the original size by three.\n  \n- **Adding a Border:** Then, a 2-inch-wide border is added around the enlarged picture. I'm picturing this like wrapping a frame around the image, but I need to account for both sides\u2014top and bottom, left and right.\n\n- **Framing Sold in Feet:** Finally, the framing material is sold by the foot, which is a bit annoying since we\u2019re dealing with inches. I\u2019ll need to convert everything to feet to figure out how much framing to buy.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculate the New Dimensions:** First, find the dimensions of the picture after tripling.\n  \n2. **Add the Border's Width:** Determine how the border affects these dimensions.\n\n3. **Compute the Perimeter:** Once I have the total dimensions, calculate the perimeter to know how much framing is needed.\n\n4. **Convert to Feet:** Finally, convert the perimeter from inches to feet since the framing is sold in feet.\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\nDoes that seem correct? Let me think\u2014adding the border should increase both the length and the width, but I need to ensure I'm not double-counting the border width. I think calculating the new dimensions accounting for the border is the right approach, but I should double-check as I go.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Enlarged Dimensions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start by tripling the original dimensions of the picture.\n\n- **Original Width:** 4 inches\n- **Original Height:** 6 inches\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Enlarged Width:** 4 inches \u00d7 3 = 12 inches\n- **Enlarged Height:** 6 inches \u00d7 3 = 18 inches\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Tripling should definitely increase both dimensions. Yeah, that seems right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Adding the Border**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to add a 2-inch-wide border around the enlarged picture. This means the border adds to both sides of the width and height.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Additional Width from Border:** 2 inches on both sides = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 inches\n- **Additional Height from Border:** 2 inches on both sides = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 inches\n\n**Wait...**\n\nHold on, am I adding 4 inches to both width and height? That doesn't seem right because the border covers both sides. I need to **add** 2 inches to **each side**, so I should be adding 4 inches total, but only on one dimension\u2014width or height\u2014at a time.\n\nI think what I need to do is to account for both the width and height being increased by the border. Let me adjust my approach.\n\n**Adjusted Calculation:**\n\n- **Total Width with Border:** \n  - Enlarge Width: 12 inches\n  - Add Border: 2 inches on each side \u2192 12 + 4 = 16 inches\n\n- **Total Height with Border:** \n  - Enlarge Height: 18 inches\n  - Add Border: 2 inches on each side \u2192 18 + 4 = 22 inches\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs this correct? Adding 2 inches on each side accounts for both the width and the height increasing due to the border. Yeah, that seems logical now.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Perimeter of the Border**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWith the total dimensions now clear, I can calculate the perimeter to determine how much framing is needed.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Perimeter Formula:** P = 2 \u00d7 (Length + Width)\n  \n- **Total Perimeter:**\n  - Length = 16 inches\n  - Width = 22 inches\n  \n  \\[\n  P = 2 \u00d7 (16 + 22) = 2 \u00d7 38 = 76 \\text{ inches}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, 76 inches? That seems a bit off. Let me re-check my earlier calculations.\n\n**Re-examination:**\n\nAh! I just realized I need to ensure I added the border correctly. But looking back, I added 2 inches on each side for both dimensions, which should be correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, maybe the initial thought process was slightly off, but the calculations seem correct now. I added 4 inches total (2 on each side) to both the width and height after tripling the dimensions.\n\nSo, I think the perimeter calculation is right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Converting Inches to Feet**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince the framing is sold in increments of one foot, I need to convert the perimeter from inches to feet.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Conversion Factor:** 1 foot = 12 inches\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Feet} = \\frac{76 \\text{ inches}}{12} = 6.333 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nHmm, 6.333 feet? That doesn't seem practical for purchasing framing material. Framing is sold in whole feet, so I need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n**Does that make sense?**\n\nYes, since you can't purchase a fraction of a foot of framing, you would need to buy 7 feet.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet's quickly go through the steps to ensure everything aligns:\n\n1. **Enlarged Dimensions:** Correctly tripled the original size.\n2. **Added Border:** Accounted for the width of the border on both sides, increasing both dimensions appropriately.\n3. **Calculated Perimeter:** Used the correct formula with the adjusted dimensions.\n4. **Converted to Feet:** Converted inches to feet and rounded up for practicality in purchasing.\n\n**Does the final answer make sense?**\n\nYes, after double-checking each step, the minimum number of linear feet of framing that must be purchased is **7 feet**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy carefully stepping through each part of the problem:\n\n- I calculated the enlarged dimensions of the picture.\n- Added the border's width correctly, ensuring both dimensions were adjusted.\n- Determined the perimeter to find out how much framing was needed.\n- Converted the measurement from inches to feet, rounding up to ensure whole feet were purchased.\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure to reflect and adjust my approach as needed, checking each calculation to ensure accuracy. This methodical approach led to the correct and practical solution: **7 feet of framing material.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**7 feet of framing must be purchased to go around the perimeter of the border.**",

  "ground_truth": "After the picture is enlarged by tripling its dimensions, the dimensions become $12\\times18$. After the border is added, the dimensions of the picture increase to $16\\times22$ (since each side has a 2-inch border). The perimeter is $16+16+22+22=76$ inches. Since $76/12=6\\frac{1}{3}$, we need $\\boxed{7}$ feet of framing to go around the entire picture."
