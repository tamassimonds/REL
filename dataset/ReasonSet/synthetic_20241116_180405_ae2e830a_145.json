    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started by understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**User Request:** Compute the product of the area and perimeter of square \\(ABCD\\) on a 5 by 5 grid.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Okay, so we have a square \\(ABCD\\) with vertices labeled. Each vertex is a dot on a grid where each dot is 1 cm from its nearest neighbors. The grid is 5 by 5, meaning there are five rows and five columns of dots.\n\n- **What Comes to Mind:** \n  - **Finding Side Length:** I need to determine the side length of square \\(ABCD\\). \n  - **Calculating Area and Perimeter:** Once I have the side length, I can easily calculate the area (side\u00b2) and perimeter (4 \u00d7 side) and then find their product.\n  - **Checking for Diagonal Positioning:** Since the vertices are not aligned with the grid's horizontal and vertical lines, I might need to consider the square's orientation.\n\n- **Potential Strategies:**\n  1. **Coordinate Approach:** Assign coordinates to each vertex and use distance formulas to find side lengths.\n  2. **Geometric Insight:** Visualize the grid and the square's positioning to deduce the side length.\n  3. **Path Analysis:** Trace the coordinates from one vertex to another to calculate the distance.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not sure which method will be quickest. The coordinate approach seems straightforward, but maybe there's a more intuitive way by visualizing the grid.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Coordinate Approach:**\n   - Assign coordinates to each dot.\n   - Use distance formulas to find the length of a side.\n\n2. **Geometric Insight:**\n   - Observe the grid pattern and how the square fits within it.\n   - Perhaps utilize Pythagorean theorem if it's a diagonal square.\n\n3. **Path Analysis:**\n   - Map out the path between vertices to calculate distance.\n\n- **Reflection:** The coordinate approach seems methodical and should work, but maybe the geometric insight could offer a quicker solution by leveraging the grid's symmetry.\n\n### **Exploring the Coordinate Approach**\n\n**Step 1: Assign Coordinates**\n\n- Let\u2019s define the grid:\n  - Each dot represents a vertex with coordinates based on its position.\n\n- **Assigning Coordinates:**\n  - Bottom-left dot (0,0).\n  - The grid extends to (4,4), since it's a 5 by 5 grid.\n\n- **Square \\(ABCD\\):**\n  - \\(A\\) at (3,4)\n  - \\(B\\) at (4,1)\n  - \\(C\\) at (1,0)\n  - \\(D\\) at (0,3)\n\n- **Thoughts:** Alright, this makes sense. Each vertex has distinct coordinates that reflect its position on the grid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Side Length**\n\n- **Approach:** Use the distance formula between two adjacent vertices. Let's take \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n- **Distance Formula:** \n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Applying to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):**\n  \\[\n  AB = \\sqrt{(4 - 3)^2 + (1 - 4)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 9} = \\sqrt{10} \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, so the side length is \\(\\sqrt{10}\\) cm? That seems reasonable given the grid's orientation.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Area and Perimeter**\n\n- **Area \\(A\\):** \n  \\[\n  A = \\text{side}^2 = (\\sqrt{10})^2 = 10 \\text{ cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n- **Perimeter \\(P\\):** \n  \\[\n  P = 4 \\times \\text{side} = 4 \\times \\sqrt{10} \\text{ cm} = 4\\sqrt{10} \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n\n- **Product:** \n  \\[\n  \\text{Product} = A \\times P = 10 \\times 4\\sqrt{10} = 40\\sqrt{10} \\text{ cm}^3\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** This seems correct numerically, but let\u2019s ensure the approach matches the problem's requirements.\n\n### **Cross-Verification with Geometric Insight**\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\n- **Observation:** The square \\(ABCD\\) is rotated within the grid, so the diagonal might align with the grid's horizontal and vertical axes.\n\n- **Diagonal Calculation:**\n  - **Diagonal (\\(AC\\)):**\n    \\[\n    AC = \\sqrt{(3 - 1)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 16} = \\sqrt{20} \\text{ cm}\n    \\]\n  \n- **Side Length from Diagonal:**\n  - For a square, the relationship between the side length \\(s\\) and the diagonal \\(d\\) is:\n    \\[\n    d = s\\sqrt{2} \\implies s = \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{20}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{10} \\text{ cm}\n    \\]\n  \n- **Area and Perimeter Recalculated:**\n  - **Area:** \n    \\[\n    A = s^2 = (\\sqrt{10})^2 = 10 \\text{ cm}^2\n    \\]\n  \n  - **Perimeter:** \n    \\[\n    P = 4 \\times \\sqrt{10} \\text{ cm}\n    \\]\n  \n  - **Product:** \n    \\[\n    \\text{Product} = 10 \\times 4\\sqrt{10} = 40\\sqrt{10} \\text{ cm}^3\n    \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Both methods lead to the same product. This reassures me that the calculation is correct.\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n- **Checking Consistency:** Both strategies yield the same area, perimeter, and product. This consistency suggests that the approach is correct.\n\n- **Thinking Back:** Initially, I considered whether the coordinate approach was the best method, but upon reflection and cross-verification with geometric insight, it's clear that both methods are valid and lead to the same solution.\n\n- **Final Answer:** \n  \\[\n  \\boxed{40\\sqrt{10}} \\text{ cm}^3\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by exploring different methods to find the side length of square \\(ABCD\\).\n- **Strategy Selection:** Chose the coordinate approach for precision but then verified with geometric insight.\n- **Step-by-Step Calculation:** Carefully calculated the side length, area, and perimeter.\n- **Reflection and Verification:** Cross-checked results using an alternative method to ensure accuracy.\n- **Final Answer:** Confirmed that the product of the area and perimeter is \\(40\\sqrt{10}\\) cm\u00b3.\n\nThroughout this process, I continuously reflected on each step, ensuring the approach was correct and adjusting as needed. This methodical thinking ensured an accurate and reliable solution.",
