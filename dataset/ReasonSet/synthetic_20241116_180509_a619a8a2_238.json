    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, reflecting and brainstorming along the way to make sure I fully understand what's going on. I'll write it out like I'm thinking through it, complete with initial thoughts, exploring different strategies, checking along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like a human would.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question: **\"How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?\"**, I'm thinking:\n\n- **Remainder Concept:** I remember that when we divide one number by another, the remainder is what's left over after dividing as evenly as possible.\n- **Divisibility:** This reminds me of problems involving divisibility and modular arithmetic.\n- **Possible Mistakes:** Wait, I need to make sure that the divisor (the number we're dividing by) is greater than the remainder. Otherwise, having a remainder of 5 wouldn't make sense.\n\nAt first glance, it looks like I need to find all divisors of 47 that leave a remainder of 5. But then I realize, **\"Hmm, 47 is a relatively small number, so maybe I can list out the possibilities.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: List the Divisors of 47**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Since 47 is a prime number, its only divisors are 1 and 47.\n- **Reflection:** But wait, dividing by 47 itself wouldn't leave a remainder of 5 because the remainder must be less than the divisor. So, this might not be the right approach.\n\n**Strategy 2: Use Modular Arithmetic**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Maybe I can use the concept of modular arithmetic to find all integers greater than 5 that, when 47 is divided by them, leave a remainder of 5.\n- **Check:** This seems more aligned with the problem's requirements.\n\n**Strategy 3: Algebraic Approach**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Set up an equation based on the definition of divisibility. This might help formalize things.\n- **Brainstorming:** I could let \\( d \\) be the divisor and set up \\( 47 = k \\times d + 5 \\), where \\( k \\) is some integer. Then solve for \\( d \\).\n\n**Strategy 4: Trial and Error with Small Numbers**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Start testing small numbers greater than 5 to see if they satisfy the condition.\n- **Reflection:** This might be time-consuming but could work as a sanity check against the more formal approaches.\n\n**Conclusion at This Point:**\n\nI'm leaning towards **Strategy 2: Use Modular Arithmetic** because it directly addresses the remainder condition. But I'm also considering the **Algebraic Approach (Strategy 3)** to see if it formalizes the solution better.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 2: Using Modular Arithmetic**\n\n**Step 1: Define the Modular Equation**\n\n- I know that for a number to leave a remainder of 5 when dividing 47, it must satisfy:\n  \n  \\[\n  47 \\equiv 5 \\,(\\text{mod} \\,d)\n  \\]\n  \n  This means that when 47 is divided by \\( d \\), the remainder is 5.\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the Equation**\n\n- From the modular equation, I can rewrite it as:\n  \n  \\[\n  47 - 5 = 42 \\text{ is divisible by } d\n  \\]\n  \n  So, \\( 42 \\div d \\) must be an integer.\n\n**Step 3: Find All Divisors of 42**\n\n- Wait, let me list the divisors of 42 to see which numbers can divide 42:\n  \n  \\[\n  42 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n  \\]\n  \n  Therefore, the divisors are: **1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.**\n\n**Step 4: Filter Divisors Greater than 5**\n\n- According to the problem, the divisor \\( d \\) must be greater than 5 to leave a remainder of 5. So, let's filter the list:\n  \n  \\[\n  d = 6, 7, 14, 21, 42\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** This makes sense because only these numbers can leave a remainder of 5 when dividing 47.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Check**\n\n**Does This Approach Make Sense?**\n\n- We're finding all divisors of 42 because \\( 47 - 5 = 42 \\). If 42 is divisible by \\( d \\), then 47 leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by \\( d \\).\n- The filtered divisors (6, 7, 14, 21, 42) are all greater than 5, aligning with the problem's requirements.\n\n**Is Everything Correct So Far?**\n\n- Yes, it seems logical. But let me double-check by considering if any of these divisors would not satisfy the remainder condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking Each Candidate Divisor**\n\n**Divisor: 6**\n\n\\[\n47 \\div 6 = 7 \\quad \\text{remainder } 5\n\\]\n  \n**Check:** Works perfectly.\n\n**Divisor: 7**\n\n\\[\n47 \\div 7 = 6 \\quad \\text{remainder } 5\n\\]\n  \n**Check:** Also works.\n\n**Divisor: 14**\n\n\\[\n47 \\div 14 = 3 \\quad \\text{remainder } 5\n\\]\n  \n**Check:** Works.\n\n**Divisor: 21**\n\n\\[\n47 \\div 21 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder } 5\n\\]\n  \n**Check:** Works.\n\n**Divisor: 42**\n\n\\[\n47 \\div 42 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder } 5\n\\]\n  \n**Check:** Works.\n\n**Reflection:** All these divisors satisfy the condition of leaving a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by them.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Initially thought about listing divisors or using modular arithmetic.\n- **Strategy Selection:** Chose modular arithmetic for its directness and clarity.\n- **Reflection and Checking:** Continuously checked each step and verified each candidate divisor.\n- **Final Answer:** The different counting numbers that leave a remainder of 5 when dividing 47 are **6, 7, 14, 21,** and **42**.\n\n**Total Count:** There are **five** such numbers.\n\n**Final Check:** Everything aligns with the problem's requirements. Each number greater than 5 divides 42, and therefore, 47 leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by each.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy brainstorming various strategies and reflecting on their appropriateness, I settled on using modular arithmetic to identify all divisors of 42 greater than 5. Checking each candidate confirmed that they all satisfy the remainder condition, leading to a clear and accurate solution. Throughout the process, frequent checks and reflections ensured the approach remained correct and aligned with the problem's requirements.",

  "ground_truth": "For a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, it must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. it must divide exactly into $47 - 5$, or 42, and\n\n2. it must be greater than 5, because the divisor is always greater than the remainder.\n\nWe list all divisors of 42 in pairs. They are 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3 and 14, 6 and 7. Of these, only 42, 21, 14, 6, and 7 are greater than 5. There are $\\boxed{5}$ different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47."
