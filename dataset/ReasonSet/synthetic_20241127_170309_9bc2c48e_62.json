  "solution": "Alright, let's put this together into a polished, coherent solution while retaining the original thought process and the final answer. I'll ensure it flows naturally, much like how a human would work through the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: First Thoughts and Approach Brainstorming**\n\n<MARK>Okay, so the question asks for the shortest distance between two circles defined by these equations:</MARK>\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + y^2 - 4y - 7 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + 14x + y^2 + 6y + 49 = 0\n\\]\n\n<INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:>  \n*Hmm, this looks like a geometry problem involving circles. I vaguely remember needing to find the distance between the centers and considering their radii. It\u2019s been a while since I tackled something like this, so I might need to refresh some concepts.*\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Complete the Square:**  \n   <THOUGHT>Maybe rewriting the equations can help identify the centers and radii.</THOUGHT>  \n   \n2. **Distance Between Centers:**  \n   <THOUGHT>Once I have the centers, calculating the distance seems straightforward.</THOUGHT> \n\n3. **Check for Overlapping Circles:**  \n   <THOUGHT>The relationship between the distance and radii will tell me if they overlap or are separate.</THOUGHT>\n\n4. **Using Geometry Formulas:**  \n   <THOUGHT>If needed, I can look up specific formulas for the shortest distance between circles.</THOUGHT>\n\n<REFLECTION:>  \n*At first glance, completing the square seems like a solid starting point to find the centers and radii. But if the circles overlap, I might need to adjust my approach. I think I'll start with completing the square and see where that leads me. If it doesn\u2019t work out, I can pivot to another strategy.*\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Completing the Square**\n\n### **Circle 1:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + y^2 - 4y - 7 = 0\n\\]\n\n<THOUGHT PROCESS:>  \n*Let\u2019s rewrite this by completing the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).*\n\n- **For \\(x\\):**  \n  \\[\n  x^2 - 10x \\rightarrow (x - 5)^2 - 25\n  \\]  \n  <CHECK>Is this correct? Yes, because \\((x - 5)^2 = x^2 - 10x + 25\\), so subtracting 25 balances it.</CHECK>\n\n- **For \\(y\\):**  \n  \\[\n  y^2 - 4y \\rightarrow (y - 2)^2 - 4\n  \\]  \n  <CHECK>Does this work? Yep, \\((y - 2)^2 = y^2 - 4y + 4\\), so subtracting 4 balances it.</CHECK>\n\n<WRITING OUT:>  \n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y - 2)^2 - 4 - 7 = 0\n\\]\n\n<SIMPLIFYING:>  \n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 36 = 0 \\implies (x - 5)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 36\n\\]\n\n<REFLECTION:>  \n*Alright, that worked out nicely. The first circle is centered at \\((5, 2)\\) with a radius of \\(\\sqrt{36} = 6\\).*\n\n<ANNOTATION:>  \n**Center 1:** \\( (5, 2) \\) with **Radius:** \\( 6 \\)  \n</ANNOTATION>\n\n### **Circle 2:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 14x + y^2 + 6y + 49 = 0\n\\]\n\n<THOUGHT PROCESS:>  \n*Let\u2019s apply the same method here.*\n\n- **For \\(x\\):**  \n  \\[\n  x^2 + 14x \\rightarrow (x + 7)^2 - 49\n  \\]  \n  <CHECK>Is this correct? Yes, because \\((x + 7)^2 = x^2 + 14x + 49\\), so subtracting 49 balances it.</CHECK>\n\n- **For \\(y\\):**  \n  \\[\n  y^2 + 6y \\rightarrow (y + 3)^2 - 9\n  \\]  \n  <CHECK>Does this work? Yep, \\((y + 3)^2 = y^2 + 6y + 9\\), so subtracting 9 balances it.</CHECK>\n\n<WRITING OUT:>  \n\\[\n(x + 7)^2 - 49 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + 49 = 0\n\\]\n\n<SIMPLIFYING:>  \n\\[\n(x + 7)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 = 0 \\implies (x + 7)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 9\n\\]\n\n<REFLECTION:>  \n*Great, the second circle is centered at \\((-7, -3)\\) with a radius of \\(\\sqrt{9} = 3\\).*\n\n<ANNOTATION:>  \n**Center 2:** \\( (-7, -3) \\) with **Radius:** \\( 3 \\)  \n</ANNOTATION>\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Distance Between the Centers**\n\n<THOUGHT PROCESS:>  \n*Now that I have the centers, I can find the distance between them using the distance formula.*\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\n<PLUGGING IN VALUES:>  \n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{((-7) - 5)^2 + ((-3) - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(-12)^2 + (-5)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\n\\]\n\n<REFLECTION:>  \n*So, the distance between the centers is 13.*\n\n<ANNOTATION:>  \n**Distance Between Centers:** \\( 13 \\)  \n</ANNOTATION>\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Determining the Shortest Distance Between the Circles**\n\n<THOUGHT PROCESS:>  \n*The sum of the radii is \\(6 + 3 = 9\\). The distance between the centers is 13. Since \\(13 > 9\\), the circles are **separate and do not overlap**.*\n\n<CONCLUSION:>  \n*The shortest distance between the circles is the distance between their centers minus the sum of their radii:*\n\n\\[\n\\text{Shortest Distance} = d - (r_1 + r_2) = 13 - 9 = 4\n\\]\n\n<REFLECTION:>  \n*This makes sense because the circles are apart, and the excess distance beyond their combined radii is the shortest path between their perimeters.*\n\n<ANNOTATION:>  \n**Shortest Distance:** \\( 4 \\)  \n</ANNOTATION>\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n<QUICK CHECK:>  \n- **Centers and Radii:**  \n  - Circle 1: Center at \\((5, 2)\\), Radius \\(6\\)  \n  - Circle 2: Center at \\((-7, -3)\\), Radius \\(3\\)  \n  - **Sum of Radii:** \\(6 + 3 = 9\\)  \n  - **Distance Between Centers:** \\(13\\)  \n\n- **Comparison:**  \n  - Since \\(13 > 9\\), the circles do not touch or overlap, confirming that the shortest distance is \\(4\\).\n\n<DEEPER REFLECTION:>  \n*Initially, I considered different strategies and started with completing the square, which worked well to identify the centers and radii. Calculating the distance between the centers confirmed that the circles are separate, validating the approach. Everything checks out, so I'm confident in the solution.*\n\n<FINAL CHECK:>  \n**All calculations are consistent and correct.**  \n</FINAL CHECK>\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER BOX:>  \nThe shortest distance between the circles is **4**.  \n</ANSWER BOX>\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\n<END:>  \n*By brainstorming multiple strategies and starting with completing the square, I was able to simplify the problem and find the necessary components to calculate the shortest distance. Regularly checking each step ensured that the approach was correct, and being open to adjusting strategies helped maintain accuracy throughout the process.*\n\n<END></CENTER>\n\n---\n\nThere we go! I've structured the solution to maintain the original thought process, ensuring it remains human-like and authentic while making the final answer clear and coherent.",
  "ground_truth": "We complete the square for the first equation by observing that the first equation is equivalent to \\[\n(x^2-10x +25) +(y^2-4y +4)=36,\n\\] which is also equivalent to \\[\n(x-5)^2 +(y-2)^2 =6^2.\n\\] Similarly, the equation for the second circle is \\[\n(x+7)^2 +(y+3)^2 =3^2.\n\\] Hence, the centers of the circles are $(5,2)$ and $(-7,-3)$, and the radii of the circles are equal to 6 and 3, respectively.  The distance between the points $(5,2)$ and $(-7,-3)$ by the distance formula is $\\sqrt{(5-(-7))^2+(2-(-3))^2}=\\sqrt{12^2+5^2}=\\sqrt{169}=13$.  Therefore, to find the shortest distance between the two circles, we must subtract from $13$ the sum of the radii of the two circles.  Thus, the shortest distance between the circles is $13-3-6 = \\boxed{4}$."
