I'll walk you through my thought process step by step, even if it involves exploring different paths, making mistakes, and having \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's start by fully grasping the problem.\n\n- **What's Given?**\n  - Urn 1: 4 green balls and 6 blue balls.\n  - Urn 2: 16 green balls and **N** blue balls.\n  - A single ball is drawn from each urn.\n\n- **What's the Probability?**\n  - The probability that both balls are of the **same color** is 0.58.\n\n- **What We Need to Find?**\n  - The value of **N**.\n\n**Initial Reaction:** \nThis looks like a probability problem involving two urns with colored balls. The goal is to find the number of blue balls (**N**) in the second urn such that the probability of drawing two balls of the same color is 0.58.\n\n**Reflection:** \nIt seems familiar\u2014probability involving drawing two balls of the same color often involves calculating the probabilities of both being green or both being blue. But I'm not entirely sure how to set it up just yet.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Direct Probability Calculation:** Calculate the probability of both balls being green and both being blue, then set up an equation based on the given probability.\n2. **Use of Total Probability:** Consider all possible color combinations and their probabilities.\n3. **Check with Expectation:** Maybe check if the expected probability aligns with the given probability for a sanity check.\n\n**Feeling:** \nI'm leaning towards the **Direct Probability Calculation** method because it seems straightforward\u2014calculate the probabilities for each color match and set them equal to the given probability.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Probabilities for Urn 1**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's start by calculating the probability of drawing a green ball or a blue ball from Urn 1.\n\n- **Total Balls in Urn 1:**\u00a0\n  \\[\n\u00a0 \u00a04 \\text{ (green)} + 6 \\text{ (blue)} = 10 \\text{ balls}\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n- **Probability of Drawing a Green Ball from Urn 1:**\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0P(\\text{Green from Urn 1}) = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n- **Probability of Drawing a Blue Ball from Urn 1:**\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0P(\\text{Blue from Urn 1}) = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n\n**Check:** \nDoes this make sense? Yes, the probabilities add up to 1 (0.4 + 0.6 = 1), which is correct.\n\n**Reflection:** \nOkay, Urn 1's probabilities are straightforward. Now, let's move on to Urn 2, which has **N** blue balls. I need to express the probabilities in terms of **N**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Express Probabilities for Urn 2 in Terms of N**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nUrn 2 has 16 green balls and **N** blue balls. I need to find the probabilities of drawing green and blue balls from Urn 2.\n\n- **Total Balls in Urn 2:**\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a016 \\text{ (green)} + N \\text{ (blue)} = 16 + N \\text{ balls}\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n- **Probability of Drawing a Green Ball from Urn 2:**\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0P(\\text{Green from Urn 2}) = \\frac{16}{16 + N}\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n- **Probability of Drawing a Blue Ball from Urn 2:**\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0P(\\text{Blue from Urn 2}) = \\frac{N}{16 + N}\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n\n**Check:** \nWait, does this make sense? The probabilities should also add up to 1. Let's verify:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{16 + N} + \\frac{N}{16 + N} = \\frac{16 + N}{16 + N} = 1\n\\]\n\nYes, it checks out!\n\n**Reflection:** \nGreat! Now I have the probabilities for both urns. Next, I'll calculate the probability of both balls being the same color.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate Probability of Both Balls Being the Same Color**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThere are two scenarios where both balls are of the same color:\n1. Both balls are green.\n2. Both balls are blue.\n\nI need to calculate the probabilities for each scenario and add them together.\n\n**Probability of Both Balls Being Green:**\n- Probability of green from Urn 1: 0.4\n- Probability of green from Urn 2:\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0P(\\text{Green from Urn 2}) = \\frac{16}{16 + N}\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n- Combined Probability:\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0P(\\text{Both Green}) = 0.4 \\times \\frac{16}{16 + N} = \\frac{6.4}{16 + N}\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n\n**Probability of Both Balls Being Blue:**\n- Probability of blue from Urn 1: 0.6\n- Probability of blue from Urn 2:\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0P(\\text{Blue from Urn 2}) = \\frac{N}{16 + N}\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n- Combined Probability:\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0P(\\text{Both Blue}) = 0.6 \\times \\frac{N}{16 + N} = \\frac{0.6N}{16 + N}\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n\n**Total Probability of Both Balls Being the Same Color:**\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0P(\\text{Same Color}) = \\frac{6.4}{16 + N} + \\frac{0.6N}{16 + N} = \\frac{6.4 + 0.6N}{16 + N}\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \nThis looks good so far. Now, according to the problem, this probability equals 0.58. So, I need to set up an equation to solve for **N**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Set Up the Equation Based on Given Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe problem states that the probability of both balls being the same color is 0.58. Therefore, I can set up the following equation:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\frac{6.4 + 0.6N}{16 + N} = 0.58\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n\n**Check:** \nDoes this make sense? Yes, the equation is set up based on the total probability calculated in the previous step.\n\n**Reflection:** \nAlright, now I need to solve this equation for **N**. Let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solve the Equation for N**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI'll cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction and solve for **N**.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a06.4 + 0.6N = 0.58 \\times (16 + N)\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a06.4 + 0.6N = 9.28 + 0.58N\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n- **Subtract 0.58N from both sides:**\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.6N - 0.58N = 9.28 - 6.4\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.02N = 2.88\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n- **Divide both sides by 0.02 to solve for N:**\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0N = \\frac{2.88}{0.02} = 144\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \nHmm, let me pause and check if this makes sense. The solution suggests **N = 144** blue balls in Urn 2. Does this seem reasonable? Let's do a quick verification.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Quick Verification of the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, it's essential to verify if **N = 144** indeed satisfies the original probability condition.\n\n**Calculating Total Probability with N = 144:**\n\n1. **Total Balls in Urn 2:**\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a016 + 144 = 160 \\text{ balls}\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n2. **Probability of Same Color:**\n\u00a0 \u00a0\\[\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0P(\\text{Same Color}) = \\frac{6.4 + 0.6 \\times 144}{160} = \\frac{6.4 + 86.4}{160} = \\frac{92.8}{160} = 0.58\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\\]\n\n**Check:** \nThe probability comes out to be exactly 0.58, which matches the given condition.\n\n**Reflection:** \nPerfect! The solution checks out. **N = 144** is indeed correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Brainstorming and Exploring Strategies:** \n\u00a0 \u00a0Initially, I considered different methods like direct probability calculation and total probability. The direct approach seemed the most straightforward.\n\n- **Checking Work:** \n\u00a0 \u00a0Throughout, I ensured that each step made sense and that probabilities added up correctly.\n\n- **Reflection and Verification:** \n\u00a0 \u00a0By verifying the final answer against the original probability condition, I confirmed the correctness of **N = 144**.\n\n**Conclusion:** \nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, continuously checking for correctness, and reflecting on each part of the process, I've determined that the number of blue balls in the second urn (**N**) is **144**.",
