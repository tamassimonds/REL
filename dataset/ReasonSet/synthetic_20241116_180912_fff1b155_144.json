    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see how it unfolds. I'll walk through my brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking if they make sense, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were tackling this on my own.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem is about a dog tied to a post at the point \\((4,3)\\) with a 10-foot rope. We need to find the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin \\((0,0)\\).\n\nInitially, I think:\n\n- **Finding Distances:** This reminds me of problems involving circles since the dog can move within a circular area defined by the rope length.\n- **Circle Centers and Radii:** The post at \\((4,3)\\) is the center of this circle, and the rope length is the radius\u201410 feet.\n- **Maximizing Distance:** To find the greatest distance from the origin, I might need to consider the points on the circle that are farthest from \\((0,0)\\).\n\nWait a minute, let me jot down what I remember about circles and distances:\n\n- The **distance from the center of the circle to the origin** is crucial.\n- I can think about the **radius added to this distance** to find the farthest point on the circle from the origin.\n  \nBut, reflecting on this, I realize it's essential to verify if there are multiple strategies to ensure accuracy.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a need for a more geometric approach\u2014like visualizing how the circle interacts with the origin.\n\n---\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Geometric Visualization:** Draw the circle and see which points are farthest from the origin.\n2. **Distance Formula:** Use mathematical formulas to calculate the exact distances.\n3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Perhaps shift the coordinate system to simplify calculations.\n\n**Wait, let me think\u2014drawing might not be feasible here.** So, I'll probably rely on the distance formulas.\n\nBut, before jumping in, I need to ensure I understand how the circle's geometry relates to the origin.\n\n---\n\n**Exploring the Geometric Approach:**\n\n**Step 1:** Identify the Center and Radius\n\n- **Center:** \\((4,3)\\)\n- **Radius:** 10 feet\n\n**Reflection:** This makes sense; the dog can move anywhere within a circle centered at \\((4,3)\\) with a radius of 10.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the Distance from the Center to the Origin\n\n- Use the distance formula: \n  \\[\n  d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n  \\]\n- Applying it:\n  \\[\n  d = \\sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n**Wait, let me double-check this:** The distance from \\((4,3)\\) to \\((0,0)\\) is indeed 5 feet. That seems correct.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the Greatest Distance the Dog Can Reach\n\n- The greatest distance from the origin would be the **sum of the distance from the center to the origin and the radius of the circle**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Greatest Distance} = 5 \\text{ feet} + 10 \\text{ feet} = 15 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n**Hmm, does this make sense?** Adding the radius to the distance from the center seems logical because the farthest point on the circle would be along the line extending from the origin through the center to the edge of the circle.\n\n**Let me think again:** Is there any other point on the circle that could be farther? **Oh!** The farthest point should indeed be in the direction of the radius extending from the center to the origin.\n\nSo, the computation seems correct.\n\n---\n\n**Alternative Approach\u2014Verifying with Coordinates:**\n\n**Step 4:** Use the Equation of the Circle\n\n- The equation of a circle is:\n  \\[\n  (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n  \\]\n  where \\((h,k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n- For our circle:\n  \\[\n  (x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 10^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 100\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** This equation describes all the points the dog can reach. To find the farthest point from the origin, I could also consider maximizing the distance formula from \\((0,0)\\) to any point \\((x,y)\\) on the circle.\n\n**Step 5:** Maximize the Distance Formula\n\n- The distance from the origin to a point \\((x,y)\\) is:\n  \\[\n  D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n  \\]\n- But, since \\((x,y)\\) lies on the circle, we substitute from the circle's equation:\n  \\[\n  D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\text{ and } (x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 100\n  \\]\n- To maximize \\(D\\), we could use calculus, but given our earlier approach, it's clear that the farthest point lies along the line extending from the origin through \\((4,3)\\).\n\n**Wait, do I really need calculus here?** No, given that we've already established the geometric relationship, calculus might complicate things unnecessarily. Adding the radius to the distance from the center is straightforward and effective.\n\n---\n\n**Realizing a Simpler Method:**\n\n**Step 6:** Simplify the Calculation\n\n- Instead of introducing complex equations, sticking to the geometric intuition seems more efficient.\n- The key insight is recognizing that the farthest point from the origin lies along the line connecting the origin to the center \\((4,3)\\), extending outward by the radius.\n\n**Ah, this reminds me of linear extensions in geometry:** The farthest point is simply the center's distance to the origin plus the radius, which we've already calculated.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\n- **Distance from Center to Origin:** 5 feet\n- **Radius:** 10 feet\n- **Greatest Distance from Origin:** \\(5 + 10 = 15\\) feet\n\n---\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n**Step 7:** Verify the Answer Using a Different Perspective\n\n- **Another Way to Look at It:** Consider the vector from the origin to the center \\((4,3)\\) and extend it by the radius.\n- **Vector Approach:**\n  - The unit vector in the direction from the origin to the center:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Unit Vector} = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{3}{5}\\right)\n    \\]\n  - Multiplying by the radius (10 feet) to find the point on the circle:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Point} = \\left(4 + \\frac{4}{5} \\times 10, 3 + \\frac{3}{5} \\times 10\\right) = (12, 9)\n    \\]\n  - **Distance from Origin to This Point:**\n    \\[\n    D = \\sqrt{(12)^2 + (9)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 81} = \\sqrt{225} = 15 \\text{ feet}\n    \\]\n\n**Hmm, this confirms our earlier calculation:** Using a vector approach gives the same greatest distance\u201415 feet.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the calculations, the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin is **15 feet**. **Reflecting** throughout the process helped ensure the approach was correct, and checking with an alternative method reinforced the accuracy of the solution.\n\nLet\u2019s wrap up by reflecting on the process:\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Started by identifying the key elements\u2014center, radius, and the origin's position.\n- **Geometric Intuition:** Realized that the farthest point lies along the line extending from the center to the origin.\n- **Calculations:** Added the radius to the center's distance to the origin for the maximum distance.\n- **Alternative Verification:** Used a vector approach to confirm the result.\n- **Final Check:** Ensured all methods pointed to the same answer, solidifying the solution\u2019s correctness.\n\nBy thinking through different strategies and continuously checking the work, we arrived confidently at the conclusion: the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin is **15 feet**.",

  "ground_truth": "The area the dog can go in is a circle of radius $10$ centered at the point $(4,3)$. The point farthest from $(0,0)$ in the circle would be the point on the circle's circumference which is on the same diameter as $(0,0)$ but on the other side of the center of the circle.\nThe distance from the origin to the center of the circle, by the distance formula, is $\\sqrt{(4-0)^2+(3-0)^2}=\\sqrt{16+9}=5$.
