    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming possible strategies, reflecting on each approach, checking for correctness, and adjusting my methods as needed. Let's treat this like a natural problem-solving process, complete with initial thoughts, uncertainties, and \"aha moments.\"\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{3} \\le 2 + c < -2(1 + c)\n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is that this involves **compound inequalities**. It looks similar to problems where you deal with both lower and upper bounds on a variable. However, the presence of multiple comparisons makes it a bit tricky.\n\n- **Brainstorming**: \n  - **Option 1**: Split the compound inequality into two separate inequalities and solve them individually. This feels straightforward.\n  - **Option 2**: Attempt to combine both parts into a single inequality to simplify. Maybe there's a way to manipulate it.\n  - **Option 3**: Graphical approach\u2014visualize the inequalities on a number line to see the overlapping regions.\n  \nAt first glance, **Option 1** seems the most direct: splitting the inequality into two parts. This way, I can handle each part separately without getting overwhelmed. If that doesn't work, I'll consider combining them or using a graphical method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Splitting the Inequality**\n\nI'll proceed with **Option 1**:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{3} \\le 2 + c \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2 + c < -2(1 + c)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- By splitting, I can focus on solving each inequality individually.\n- This should make it easier to find the values of \\( c \\) that satisfy both conditions.\n\n**Reflection**:\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because both inequalities must be true simultaneously for \\( c \\). Solving them separately ensures that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the First Inequality**\n\nLet's tackle the first part:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{3} \\le 2 + c\n\\]\n\n**Approach**:\n- I want to isolate \\( c \\). So, let's get all terms involving \\( c \\) on one side.\n\n**Calculations**:\n- Subtract \\( c \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{3} - c \\le 2\n\\]\n\n- Simplify the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{3} - \\frac{3c}{3} \\le 2\n\\]\n\\[\n-\\frac{2c}{3} \\le 2\n\\]\n\n- **Check**: Does subtracting \\( c \\) make sense? Yes, combining like terms is correct here.\n\n- Multiply both sides by \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\). **Wait**, remember that multiplying by a negative flips the inequality:\n\n\\[\nc \\ge -3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**:\nThis seems right. Multiplying by a negative number reversed the inequality, which is what we expect.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Second Inequality**\n\nNow, the second part:\n\n\\[\n2 + c < -2(1 + c)\n\\]\n\n**Approach**:\n- Distribute the right side to simplify.\n- Isolate \\( c \\) by combining like terms.\n\n**Calculations**:\n- Expand the right side:\n\n\\[\n2 + c < -2 - 2c\n\\]\n\n- **Check**: Distributing \\( -2 \\) correctly? Let's see:\n  - \\( -2 \\times 1 = -2 \\)\n  - \\( -2 \\times c = -2c \\)\n  \n  Yes, that checks out.\n\n- Add \\( 2c \\) to both sides to move all \\( c \\) terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n2 + c + 2c < -2\n\\]\n\\[\n2 + 3c < -2\n\\]\n\n- Subtract 2 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n3c < -4\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection**: Does it make sense to divide by 3? Yes, dividing both sides will give us \\( c \\).\n\n- Divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nc < -\\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check**:\n- **Wait**, dividing by a positive number does not flip the inequality. So, this part is correct.\n\n- Final result from the second inequality: \\( c < -\\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\n**Reflection**:\nThis seems correct. I've isolated \\( c \\) and maintained the direction of the inequality.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combining the Solutions**\n\nNow, I need to find the values of \\( c \\) that satisfy **both** inequalities:\n\n\\[\nc \\ge -3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c < -\\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Approach**:\n- Think about where these two conditions overlap on a number line.\n- The solution must satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- \\( c \\ge -3 \\) means \\( c \\) can be any number greater than or equal to \\(-3\\).\n- \\( c < -\\frac{4}{3} \\) means \\( c \\) must be less than \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\).\n- **Wait**: Does this overlap? Let's visualize it.\n\n**Reflection**:\n- The first condition allows \\( c \\) to be any number from \\(-3\\) upwards.\n- The second condition restricts \\( c \\) to be less than \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\).\n- **Hmm**, the overlap would be from \\(-3\\) to \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\), inclusive of \\(-3\\) but not \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\) itself.\n\n**Check**:\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, because we are looking for values that satisfy both conditions at the same time.\n\n- **Random Insight**: Remember, when dealing with inequalities, the overlapping region represents the solution set.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Expressing the Solution in Interval Notation**\n\nThe overlapping region is:\n\n\\[\n[-3, -\\frac{4}{3})\n\\]\n\n**Approach**:\n- Use brackets [ ] to include \\(-3\\) because the inequality is \\( \\ge \\).\n- Use parentheses ( ) to exclude \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\) because the inequality is \\( < \\).\n\n**Reflection**:\n- **Is this correct?** Yes, because we\u2019re including the lower bound and excluding the upper bound.\n\n- **Check**: Does \\(-3\\) being included make sense? Yes, \\(-3\\) satisfies \\( c \\ge -3 \\).\n\n- **Does \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\) needing to be excluded make sense?** Yes, since \\( c \\) must be less than \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\), \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\) itself is not included.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe values of \\( c \\) that satisfy the given compound inequality are:\n\n\\[\nc \\in [-3, -\\frac{4}{3})\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Did splitting the inequality work?** Yes, it allowed me to handle each part separately and find the overlapping solution.\n\n- **Was multiplying by negatives handled correctly?** Yes, I remembered to flip the inequality when multiplying by a negative number.\n\n- **Is the final interval notation correct?** Yes, it accurately represents the range of \\( c \\) that satisfies both inequalities.\n\nI feel confident that the answer is correct. By checking each step and ensuring that the conditions for both inequalities are met, I've arrived at the valid solution set.\n\n--- \n\nBy approaching the problem methodically\u2014brainstorming, selecting a strategy, reflecting and adjusting as needed\u2014I was able to navigate through the complexities of the compound inequality and arrive at the correct solution in interval notation.",

  "ground_truth": "We have two inequalities which $c$ must satisfy. We consider these inequalities one at a time.\n\nThe first inequality is $\\frac{c}{3}\\le 2+c$. Multiplying both sides by $3$, we have $$c\\le 6+3c.$$Subtracting $3c$ from both sides gives $$-2c\\le 6.$$We can divide both sides by $-2$, but we must reverse the inequality since $-2$ is negative. This gives $c\\ge -3$.\n\nThe second inequality is $2+c < -2(1+c)$. Expanding the right side, we have $$2+c < -2-2c.$$Adding $2c-2$ to both sides gives $$3c<-4.$$Dividing both sides by $3$ gives $c<-\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nSo, all $c$ which satisfy both inequalities are given by $-3\\le c<-\\frac{4}{3}$, or, in interval notation, $c\\in\\boxed{\\left[-3,-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)}$."
