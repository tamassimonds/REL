    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's begin by thoroughly understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nWe're dealing with **allyl 3-oxobutanoate** being heated at high temperatures to form a new product. The goal is to determine how many **distinct hydrogen signals** will appear in the **\u00b9H NMR** of this product.\n\n- **NMR Signals:** Each unique hydrogen environment in a molecule produces a distinct signal in NMR spectroscopy. So, the number of distinct signals correlates to the number of different hydrogen environments.\n\n- **Heating at High Temperature:** This suggests a **retro-aldol reaction** might occur, leading to the formation of a new product.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**  \n1. **Identify the Structure:** I need to visualize or draw the structure of allyl 3-oxobutanoate to understand possible changes upon heating.\n2. **Predict the Reaction:** Consider what kind of reactions (e.g., retro-aldol) could occur at high temperatures and how they would affect the molecular structure.\n3. **Analyze the Product:** After predicting the reaction, determine the resulting structure and identify distinct hydrogen environments.\n4. **Count Distinct Signals:** Finally, count the unique hydrogen signals expected in the \u00b9H NMR.\n\nOkay, let's start by identifying the structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Structure of Allyl 3-Oxobutanoate**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo understand how heating affects the molecule, I need to know its starting structure. Typically, I would look up the chemical name or recall a similar structure.\n\n- **Recalling Chemical Structures:** Allyl groups are **alkenes** with a three-carbon chain and a double bond. \"3-oxobutanoate\" suggests a **ketone** (due to \"oxo\") and an **ester** (due to \"butanoate\").\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, does that make sense? An allyl group and a 3-oxobutanoate... That sounds like an **\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester**.\n\n**Checking Work:**  \nLet mebreak it down:\n- **Allyl:** \\(-CH_2=CH-CH_2-\\)\n- **3-Oxobutanoate:** A butanoate (ester) with a ketone at the 3-position.\n\n**Construction:**  \n- Start with a butanoate: \\(-CH_2-CO-CH_2-COOR\\)\n- Attach an allyl group to the 3-position: \\(-CH_2=CH-CH_2-CO-CH_2-COOR\\)\n\n**Clarification:**  \nSo, allyl 3-oxobutanoate is essentially an ester with an allyl group and a ketone. Got it.\n\n**Action Taken:**  \nNow, I have a clearer picture of the starting material. Let's move on to predicting the reaction under high temperature.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Predicting the Reaction Under High Temperature**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nHeating at high temperature typically induces **retro-aldol reactions** in \u03b2-hydroxy ketones or \u03b2-keto esters. This suggests the molecule might undergo **decarboxylation** or **aldol condensation**.\n\n- **Recalling Retro-Aldol Reactions:** In a retro-aldol reaction, a \u03b2-hydroxy ketone or \u03b2-keto ester splits into a ketone and an aldehyde or enone.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes allyl 3-oxobutanoate fit this pattern? Yes, it has a \u03b2-keto ester structure.\n\n**Checking Work:**  \n- **\u03b2-Keto Ester:** \\(-CO-CH_2-CO-OR\\)\n- **Allyl Group:** Attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHeating will likely cause the molecule to undergo a retro-aldol reaction, breaking down into acetone (or a similar ketone) and another fragment.\n\n**Action Taken:**  \nProceeding with this assumption, let's analyze the resulting product's structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Analyzing the Product's Structure**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAfter a retro-aldol reaction, the molecule likely forms an **enone** and an **aldehyde** or an **alkene**.\n\n- **Expected Products:** An allyl acetate (or similar) and a ketone.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, let me visualize this. If the molecule splits, the allyl group remains, and the ester part forms an enone.\n\n**Checking Work:**  \n- **Starting Material:** Allyl 3-oxobutanoate\n- **After Retro-Aldol:** Allyl group + Acetone/Orbitone (enone)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe product is likely **allyl acetate** (or a similar enone) plus acetone.\n\n**Clarification:**  \nIs this correct? Let's see. The allyl group would remain intact, and the oxo part would form an enone or enal.\n\n**Action Taken:**  \nHmm, perhaps the product is an **\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester** or an **enone**. The exact product depends on the specific conditions.\n\n**Re-evaluating:**  \nGiven high-temperature conditions, it's plausible that a **dehydration** step occurred, leading to an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester or enone.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying Distinct Hydrogen Environments in the Product**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the \u00b9H NMR spectrum of the product.\n\n- **Components of the Product:** Likely an allyl group and an ester part (enone).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet me list out potential hydrogen environments:\n1. **Allyl Group:**\n   - Terminal \\(-CH2-\\) next to double bond\n   - Methylene \\(-CH2-\\) attached to \\(C=CH-\\)\n   \n2. **Ester Carbonyl Adjacent Hydrogens:**\n   - Methyl or methylene groups next to the carbonyl\n\n**Checking Work:**  \n- **Allyl Group:** Typically has 3 distinct hydrogens (due to symmetry).\n- **Ester Group:** Depends on the substitution; might have 2 or 3 distinct hydrogens.\n\n**Counting Distinct Signals:**  \n1. **Allyl Group:**\n   - 3 (\\(CH_2\\) near double bond)\n   - 2 (\\(CH_2\\) nearest to the ester)\n   \n2. **Ester Group:**\n   - 3 (\\(CH_3\\) or \\(CH_2\\) groups)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, am I overcounting? The allyl group's methyls might have similar environments.\n\n**Checking Work:**  \n- **Allyl Methyls:** Likely identical\n\n**Re-evaluating:**  \nAfter considering symmetry, perhaps the allyl group contributes fewer distinct signals. Adjusting the count accordingly.\n\n**Action Taken:**  \nLet's proceed with counting by drawing hypothetical NMR environments.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Drawing Hypothetical NMR Environments**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nDrawing can help visualize distinct hydrogen environments better. Let's sketch the product considering the retro-aldol outcome.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIs this the best approach? Maybe, but it might take time. Alternatively, I could list possible environments.\n\n**Checking Work:**  \nDrawing seems time-consuming. Let's list environments instead.\n\n**Listing Hydrogen Environments:**\n1. **Allyl Group:**\n   - Terminal \\(-CH2-\\): 2 hydrogens\n   - Methylene \\(-CH2-\\) near ester: 2 hydrogens\n   \n2. **Ester Group:**\n   - Methyl \\(CH_3\\) or \\(-CH2-\\) next to carbonyl: 3 hydrogens\n   \n**Counting Distinct Signals:**  \n1. **Allyl**: 2 (\\(CH_2\\)) + 1 (\\(CH_2\\) near ester) = 3\n2. **Ester**: 3 (methyl/methylene)\n\n**Total:**  \n3 + 3 = **6 distinct signals**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis count seems reasonable. However, cross-checking with possible options.\n\n**Checking Work:**  \n- **Option (A) 6**: Matches our count\n\n**Re-evaluating:**  \nDoes this align with typical NMR counting? Yes, each unique hydrogen's environment is considered.\n\n**Potential Oversights:**  \nEnsuring no overlapping environments or ignored hydrogen signals.\n\n**Action Taken:**  \nWait, let me double-check. All unique environments are accounted for, and overlap is unlikely due to differing chemical environments.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Validating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI want to ensure the approach is correct before finalizing the answer. Let's briefly recap each step.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDid I properly account for all hydrogen environments? Are there any symmetrical aspects that might reduce the number of signals?\n\n**Checking Work:**  \n- **Allyl Group:** Accounted for terminal and methylene hydrogens\n- **Ester Group:** Considered methyl/methylene near carbonyl\n\n**Potential Mistakes:**  \n- Overlapping environments\n- Ignoring symmetrical hydrogens\n\n**Re-evaluating:**  \nGiven the structure, it's unlikely to have overlapping environments beyond what's already accounted for.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nDoes the total make sense given the molecule's structure? Yes, 6 distinct signals align with expectations for an allyl ester with no overlapping environments.\n\n**Action Taken:**  \nI'm confident in the count. The answer is **6 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nHaving gone through various strategies, checked multiple times, and ensured all hydrogen environments are accounted for, it's time to finalize the answer.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes the answer make sense considering the structure and reaction type? Yes, 6 distinct signals are plausible for the product.\n\n**Checking Work:**  \n- **Product Type:** \u03b1,\u03b2-Unsaturated ester/enone\n- **Expected Signals:** Aligns with the count\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe number of distinct hydrogen signals in the \u00b9H NMR of the product is **6**.\n\n**Action Taken:**  \nSelect **Option (A) 6** as the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThroughout this problem, I explored different strategies, starting with identifying the structure, predicting the reaction, analyzing the product, and finally counting the distinct hydrogen signals. At each step, I reflected and checked my work to ensure accuracy.\n\nInitially, I considered possible reactions and their outcomes, leading me to the retro-aldol reaction. By mapping out hydrogen environments and accounting for symmetry, I arrived at the number of distinct signals.\n\nThis approach ensured a thorough understanding and accurate final answer. Always remembering to check and re-evaluate helps catch potential mistakes and confirms the validity of the solution.\n\n**Final Answer: Option (A) 6**.\n\n---\n\n**Recap of Brainstorming and Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:** Clarified the goal\u2014determining distinct hydrogen signals in \u00b9H NMR.\n  \n2. **Identifying the Structure:** Recognized allyl 3-oxobutanoate as a \u03b2-keto ester with an allyl group.\n  \n3. **Predicting the Reaction:** Anticipated a retro-aldol reaction leading to simpler fragments.\n  \n4. **Analyzing the Product:** Concluded the formation of allyl acetate and acetone.\n  \n5. **Counting Distinct Signals:** Assessed hydrogen environments, accounting for symmetry and overlapping.\n  \n6. **Validating the Approach:** Ensured all environments were accounted for and no mistakes were present.\n  \n7. **Finalizing the Answer:** Confirmed the count aligns with the expected NMR signals.\n\nThroughout, I embraced the natural flow of thinking\u2014starting off uncertain, brainstorming strategies, checking for correctness, and adjusting approaches as needed. This reflective process ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",
