  "solution": "Certainly! Let's put everything together into a coherent and complete solution, reflecting natural problem-solving thinking while maintaining the final answer. Here\u2019s how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, I've got a rhombus with an **area of 108 square units**, and the **diagonals have a ratio of 3 to 2**. The goal is to find the length of the **longest diagonal**.\n\n**First Impression:**\n- Hmm, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral where all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n- The diagonals are crucial in determining the area, so maybe I can use that relationship.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure how the ratio of the diagonals fits in. Let me brainstorm some strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Area Formula Involving Diagonals:**\n   - There's a formula for the area of a rhombus using its diagonals:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times d_1 \\times d_2\n     \\]\n   - This could be useful since I know the area and need to find the diagonals.\n\n2. **Express Diagonals in Terms of Each Other:**\n   - Given the ratio of 3 to 2, I can express one diagonal in terms of the other.\n   - Maybe set \\( d_1 = 3x \\) and \\( d_2 = 2x \\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Substitute back into the area formula to solve for \\( x \\), and then find the actual lengths of the diagonals.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems like a logical path. I'll start with the first strategy and see if it works. If not, I\u2019ll reassess.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Using the Area Formula**\n\nLet\u2019s plug the known values into the area formula.\n\n\\[\n108 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times d_1 \\times d_2\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to express \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) in terms of each other using the given ratio.\n- Since the ratio is 3 to 2, I can set:\n  \\[\n  d_1 = 3x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d_2 = 2x\n  \\]\n- This way, I have only one variable to solve for.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This makes sense because using a single variable simplifies the equation. Let\u2019s proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting into the Area Formula**\n\nSubstitute \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) in terms of \\( x \\) back into the area formula:\n\n\\[\n108 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (3x) \\times (2x)\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n108 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6x^2 = 3x^2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Wait a minute, let me double-check this calculation.\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6x^2 = 3x^2\n  \\]\n  Yes, that's correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So far, so good. The equation looks simple now. Let\u2019s solve for \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( x \\)**\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for \\( x^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n3x^2 = 108\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{108}{3} = 36\n\\]\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{36} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this value make sense?\n  \\[\n  x = 6\n  \\]\n  Yeah, taking the square root of 36 gives 6, so no issues here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Now that I have \\( x \\), I can find the actual lengths of the diagonals. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Lengths of the Diagonals**\n\nUsing \\( x = 6 \\):\n\n\\[\nd_1 = 3x = 3 \\times 6 = 18\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd_2 = 2x = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since the ratio was 3 to 2, the longest diagonal should be \\( d_1 = 18 \\) units.\n\n**Check:**\n- Let me quickly verify:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{d_1}{d_2} = \\frac{18}{12} = \\frac{3}{2}\n  \\]\n  Yes, the ratio holds true.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Everything checks out. The longest diagonal is indeed 18 units.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter walking through the steps and verifying each part of the process, the length of the **longest diagonal** is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{18 \\text{ units}}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought**\n\nBy carefully considering the relationships between the diagonals and the area, and validating each step along the way, I've confidently arrived at the correct solution. Brainstorming different strategies and being open to checking and adjusting my approach ensured accuracy throughout the problem-solving process.\n\n---\n\nThere we go! The length of the longest diagonal is **18 units**, and the complete solution reflects a natural, thoughtful problem-solving approach.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the diagonals have length $3x$ and $2x$. Half the product of the diagonals of a rhombus is equal to the area, so $(2x)(3x)/2= 108$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = 6$. Therefore, the length of the longest diagonal is $3x = \\boxed{18}$."
