    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The goal is to simplify the expression \\(\\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i}\\) into the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers, potentially as improper fractions. \n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see this expression, several strategies pop into my head:\n\n1. **Multiply by the Conjugate:** This is a common technique used to eliminate imaginary numbers from the denominator. I've seen it work well for similar problems.\n\n2. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts:** Maybe I could split the numerator and denominator to see if something simplifies before applying any other methods.\n\n3. **Polar/Exponential Form:** Converting complex numbers to their polar form might offer a different perspective, but I usually reserve this for multiplication or division of multiple complex numbers at once.\n\n4. **Direct Division:** Attempting to divide each part directly, though I recall that might lead to messy imaginary parts without clearing the denominator.\n\n**Reflection:** The most familiar and straightforward approach is multiplying by the conjugate. However, I'm going to explore these strategies to see which feels more intuitive. Let's start with the conjugate method since it\u2019s commonly used for these types of problems.\n\n### **Step 1: Multiplying by the Conjugate**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo eliminate the imaginary unit \\(i\\) from the denominator, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(1 + 2i\\) is \\(1 - 2i\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} \\times \\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \\dfrac{(3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)}{(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)}\n\\]\n\n**Let's compute each part step by step.**\n\n**Numerator:**\n\n\\[\n(3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) = 3 \\times 1 + 3 \\times (-2i) + 4i \\times 1 + 4i \\times (-2i)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 3 - 6i + 4i - 8i^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= 3 - 2i - 8(-1) \\quad (\\text{since } i^2 = -1)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 3 - 2i + 8\n\\]\n\\[\n= 11 - 2i\n\\]\n\n**Denominator:**\n\n\\[\n(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times (-2i) + 2i \\times 1 + 2i \\times (-2i)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 - 2i + 2i - 4i^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 - 4(-1) \\quad (\\text{since } i^2 = -1)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n= 5\n\\]\n\n**Combined Result:**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{11 - 2i}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Simplified:**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2}{5}i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems to work correctly. Multiplying by the conjugate removed the imaginary unit from the denominator, making it easier to express the result in the desired form \\(a + bi\\). Let me double-check the calculations to ensure everything is correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- Numerator: \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\), \\(3 \\times (-2i) = -6i\\), \\(4i \\times 1 = 4i\\), \\(4i \\times (-2i) = -8i^2 = 8\\). Adding them: \\(3 + 8 - 6i + 4i = 11 - 2i\\).  \n- Denominator: \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\), \\(1 \\times (-2i) = -2i\\), \\(2i \\times 1 = 2i\\), \\(2i \\times (-2i) = -4i^2 = 4\\). Adding them: \\(1 + 4 - 2i + 2i = 5\\).  \n\nEverything checks out. The steps feel logical and lead directly to the desired form.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nMaybe I could handle the real and imaginary parts separately to see if that offers a clearer path. By separating the components, I might simplify the division process before dealing with the complex parts.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} = \\dfrac{3}{1 + 2i} + \\dfrac{4i}{1 + 2i}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n**Real Part:**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{3}{1 + 2i} \\times \\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \\dfrac{3(1 - 2i)}{1 + 4} = \\dfrac{3 - 6i}{5} = \\dfrac{3}{5} - \\dfrac{6}{5}i\n\\]\n\n**Imaginary Part:**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{4i}{1 + 2i} \\times \\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \\dfrac{4i(1 - 2i)}{5} = \\dfrac{4i - 8i^2}{5} = \\dfrac{4i + 8}{5} = \\dfrac{8}{5} + \\dfrac{4}{5}i\n\\]\n\n**Adding Both Parts:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5} - \\dfrac{6}{5}i\\right) + \\left(\\dfrac{8}{5} + \\dfrac{4}{5}i\\right) = \\left(\\dfrac{3}{5} + \\dfrac{8}{5}\\right) + \\left(-\\dfrac{6}{5}i + \\dfrac{4}{5}i\\right) = \\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2}{5}i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis method also leads to the same result. It seems more complicated than just multiplying by the conjugate directly. It took extra steps to separate and then combine the parts, which isn't as efficient. However, it's always good to have multiple strategies to confirm the correctness.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nTo ensure the correctness of the answer, let's verify by multiplying the simplified result back by the denominator to see if we get the original numerator.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2}{5}i\\right)(1 + 2i) = \\dfrac{11}{5} \\times 1 + \\dfrac{11}{5} \\times 2i - \\dfrac{2}{5}i \\times 1 - \\dfrac{2}{5}i \\times 2i\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\dfrac{11}{5} + \\dfrac{22}{5}i - \\dfrac{2}{5}i - \\dfrac{4}{5}i^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\dfrac{11}{5} + \\left(\\dfrac{22}{5} - \\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)i + \\dfrac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\dfrac{11}{5} + \\dfrac{20}{5}i + \\dfrac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\dfrac{15}{5} + 4i\n\\]\n\\[\n= 3 + 4i\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMultiplying the simplified result back by the denominator returns the original numerator \\(3 + 4i\\), confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} = \\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2}{5}i\n\\]\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy initially applying the conjugate multiplication strategy, I was able to simplify the expression effectively. Exploring an alternative approach by separating the real and imaginary parts confirmed the correctness but involved more steps. Checking the final answer by reverting the simplification ensured accuracy. Having multiple strategies and verifying the result is crucial in problem-solving, especially with complex numbers.",
