  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll tackle it step by step, thinking it through just like I would naturally. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect at each stage, and ensure everything makes sense before moving on. If I spot any issues along the way, I'll backtrack and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem involves a function \\( y = h(x) \\) and its transformation \\( y = h(x-3) \\). We're told that these two graphs intersect at one point, and we need to find the sum of the coordinates of that intersection point.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Transformations:** This reminds me of horizontal shifts in graphs. Shifting a graph left or right affects where they intersect.\n- **Intersection Points:** Thinking about where two graphs overlap makes me consider setting the functions equal to each other.\n- **Symmetry or Specific Points:** Maybe the graph has a particular shape (like a parabola) that can be exploited.\n\n**But Wait...**\n\nI'm not entirely sure what the graph looks like just from the description. Maybe it's a quadratic since there's a squared term in the function definition. Let's explore that.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Set the Functions Equal:** Find where \\( h(x) = h(x-3) \\).\n2. **Analyze the Graph's Equation:** Look closely at the given function and see what kind of graph it is.\n3. **Consider Specific Points:** Check if there are obvious points where the graphs intersect.\n\n**Checking if Strategy 1 Works:**\n\nLet's start by setting \\( h(x) = h(x-3) \\) to find the intersection.\n\nBut before diving in, I need to understand the function better.\n\n### **Understanding the Function**\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[\ny = h(x) = 4.125 - \\frac{(x + 0.5)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Looks Quadratic:** This resembles the equation of a parabola. It's in the form \\( y = a - \\frac{(x+b)^2}{c} \\).\n- **Vertex Form:** The vertex seems to be at \\( x = -0.5 \\), and it opens downwards since there's a negative sign before the squared term.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUnderstanding that it's a parabola helps because parabolas have specific properties that can be useful when dealing with transformations.\n\n### **Applying Strategy 1: Set the Functions Equal**\n\nSet \\( h(x) = h(x-3) \\):\n\n\\[\n4.125 - \\frac{(x + 0.5)^2}{2} = 4.125 - \\frac{((x-3) + 0.5)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + 0.5)^2}{2} = \\frac{(x - 2.5)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n\\[\n(x + 0.5)^2 = (x - 2.5)^2\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Setting Equal:** By equating the two expressions, I'm looking for points where the original function and its shifted version have the same value.\n- **Simplification:** Removing the denominators makes it easier to work with.\n\n**Is This Making Sense?**\n\nYes, it seems straightforward so far. Let's proceed to expand both sides.\n\n### **Expanding Both Sides**\n\nExpand \\( (x + 0.5)^2 \\) and \\( (x - 2.5)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n(x + 0.5)^2 = x^2 + 1x + 0.25\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 2.5)^2 = x^2 - 5x + 6.25\n\\]\n\nSet them equal:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 1x + 0.25 = x^2 - 5x + 6.25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, I can see that the \\( x^2 \\) terms on both sides will cancel out. That's a good sign because it simplifies the equation.\n\n### **Simplifying the Equation**\n\nSubtract \\( x^2 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n1x + 0.25 = -5x + 6.25\n\\]\n\nBring all terms involving \\( x \\) to one side and constants to the other:\n\n\\[\n1x + 5x = 6.25 - 0.25\n\\]\n\\[\n6x = 6\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n\\[\nx = 1\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Solving for \\( x \\):** The equation simplifies nicely, leading to \\( x = 1 \\).\n- **First Part of the Intersection Point:** I've found the x-coordinate of the intersection.\n\n**Does This Seem Right?**\n\nIt makes sense so far, but I need to find the y-coordinate to complete the intersection point.\n\n### **Finding the Y-Coordinate**\n\nPlug \\( x = 1 \\) back into the original function \\( h(x) \\):\n\n\\[\ny = h(1) = 4.125 - \\frac{(1 + 0.5)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 4.125 - \\frac{2.25}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 4.125 - 1.125\n\\]\n\\[\n= 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Calculating \\( y \\):** The computation is straightforward, and I end up with \\( y = 3 \\).\n- **Intersection Point:** So, the intersection point is \\( (1, 3) \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does It Make Sense?** Given that \\( x = 1 \\) satisfies the equation where the two functions intersect, and plugging it back gives a valid y-coordinate, it seems correct.\n\n### **Final Step: Summing the Coordinates**\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of the coordinates of the intersection point:\n\n\\[\n1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\n<ANSWER>4 solution</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Validation**\n\n- **Does the Solution Align with the Requirement?** Yes, I've found the intersection point and summed the coordinates as required.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Initially considered setting the functions equal, and it worked perfectly. No need to explore other strategies since the first approach led directly to the solution.\n- **Confidence in the Answer:** The steps followed logically, and the calculations were straightforward, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Understanding Transformations:** Recognizing that \\( y = h(x-3) \\) is a horizontal shift helped in setting up the equation.\n- **Simplification:** Cancelling out terms early made the problem easier to solve.\n- **Validation:** Plugging back the solution into the original equation confirmed its correctness.\n  \nBy thinking through each step, checking along the way, and being open to adjusting strategies if needed, I arrived at the correct solution efficiently.\n\n---\n\nAlright, I\u2019ve walked through the problem, reflecting and validating each step to ensure accuracy. If there were any missteps, they\u2019ve been addressed by backtracking and adopting a correct approach, leading to the final answer of 4.",
  "ground_truth": "If the graphs intersect at $(a,b)$, then we have $$h(a) = h(a-3) \\qquad(= b).$$Thus, $(a,b)$ and $(a-3,b)$ are both on the original graph of $y=h(x)$. Looking for two points on the original graph which are separated by $3$ units horizontally, we find $(-2,3)$ and $(1,3)$. Thus $a-3=-2,$ $a=1,$ and $b=3;$ the graphs of $y=h(x)$ and $y=h(x-3)$ intersect at $(1,3),$ the sum of whose coordinates is $\\boxed{4}$."
