Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) lie on \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) such that the angle \\(\\angle AV_1 B = 90^\\circ\\). We need to find the locus \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) of the midpoint of \\(\\overline{AB}\\), which turns out to be another parabola with vertex \\(V_2\\) and focus \\(F_2\\). Finally, we have to determine the ratio \\(\\frac{F_1F_2}{V_1V_2}\\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\n- This looks like a **locus problem** involving parabolas.\n- Reminds me of problems where midpoints trace specific paths.\n- Hmm, maybe using **coordinate geometry** could help visualize and solve it.\n- But honestly, the angle condition \\(\\angle AV_1 B = 90^\\circ\\) is a bit tricky\u2014might need to think more about how that plays in.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n**1.

Vector Geometry:**\n\n- Utilize vectors to handle the angle condition and midpoint calculations.\n\n**4. Analytical Geometry with Angles:**\n\n- Explore how the \\(90^\\circ\\) angle condition affects the positions of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Coordinate Geometry** seems straightforward, but it might get algebraically intense.\n- **Geometric Properties** could provide a more elegant solution if applicable.\n- **Vector Geometry** might simplify handling angles.\n- **Analytical Geometry with Angles** could specifically address the \\(90^\\circ\\) condition.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- Let's **start with Coordinate Geometry** to set up the problem. If it gets too messy, we can pivot to another approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Coordinate System**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Assigning coordinates to elements of the parabola can make abstract ideas concrete.\n- Let's place the parabola in a standard position to simplify calculations.\n\n**Action:**\n\n- Consider the parabola \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) with vertex \\(V_1 = (0, 0)\\) and focus \\(F_1 = (0, f)\\).\n- The equation of the parabola opening upwards is \\(y = \\frac{x^2}{4f}\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does this setup align with standard parabola properties?  \n  *Yes, the vertex is at the origin, and the focus is along the y-axis.*\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Starting with a simple, familiar representation feels right.\n- This should make finding points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) easier.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on the Parabola**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) lie on \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) such that \\(\\angle AV_1 B = 90^\\circ\\).\n- This angle condition is crucial but tricky\u2014need a way to incorporate it.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n- **Use Coordinates:** Assign general coordinates to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and apply the angle condition.\n- **Leverage Symmetry:** Perhaps the parabola's symmetry can simplify the problem.\n- **Apply the Angle Condition:** Use vector geometry to enforce the \\(90^\\circ\\) angle.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Assigning coordinates seems straightforward, but applying the angle condition might require careful handling.\n- Using vector geometry could make enforcing the angle condition more manageable.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- Let's proceed by assigning coordinates and see how it plays out. If it gets complicated, we'll consider vectors.\n\n**Action:**\n\n- Let \\(A = (x_1, y_1)\\) and \\(B = (x_2, y_2)\\) be points on \\(\\mathcal{P}\\).\n- Since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) lie on \\(\\mathcal{P}\\), their coordinates satisfy \\(y_1 = \\frac{x_1^2}{4f}\\) and \\(y_2 = \\frac{x_2^2}{4f}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- So far, so good. We've represented \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in terms of their coordinates on the parabola.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Angle Condition \\(\\angle AV_1 B = 90^\\circ\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The angle condition suggests that the vectors \\(V_1A\\) and \\(V_1B\\) are perpendicular.\n- When two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n- **Vector Approach:** Use the dot product of vectors \\(V_1A\\) and \\(V_1B\\) to enforce perpendicularity.\n- **Coordinate Geometry:** Set up the equation based on the dot product being zero.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This seems like a solid path. Using the dot product is a standard way to handle perpendicular vectors.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- Let's proceed with the **Vector Approach**.\n\n**Action:**\n\n- Vectors from \\(V_1\\) to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are:\n  \\[\n  \\overrightarrow{V_1A} = (x_1, y_1), \\quad \\overrightarrow{V_1B} = (x_2, y_2)\n  \\]\n- The dot product condition is:\n  \\[\n  \\overrightarrow{V_1A} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{V_1B} = x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0\n  \\]\n- Substitute \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) from the parabola's equation:\n  \\[\n  x_1x_2 + \\left(\\frac{x_1^2}{4f}\\right)\\left(\\frac{x_2^2}{4f}\\right) = 0\n  \\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\nx_1x_2 + \\frac{x_1^2 x_2^2}{16f^2} = 0\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does this equation make sense?

 \n  *Yes, it provides a constant relationship between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\).*\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This is a valuable insight\u2014\\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are related by a fixed product, which will help in finding the midpoint.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Midpoint of \\(\\overline{AB}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The midpoint \\(M\\) of \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is given by:\n  \\[\n  M = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)\n  \\]\n- We need to express \\(M\\) in terms of known quantities to find the locus \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\).\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n- **Use the Relationship \\(x_1 x_2 = -16f^2\\):** This can help simplify expressions.\n- **Express \\(y_1 + y_2\\):** Since \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) are both on the parabola, their sum might have a neat form.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Given \\(x_1 x_2 = -16f^2\\), we might be able to find \\(x_1 + x_2\\) using other quadratic relationships.\n- Let's see if we can derive \\(x_1 + x_2\\).\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- Proceed with expressing the midpoint coordinates using the known relationship.\n\n**Action:**\n\n- Note that \\(y_1 = \\frac{x_1^2}{4f}\\) and \\(y_2 = \\frac{x_2^2}{4f}\\).\n- To find \\(y_1 + y_2\\):\n  \\[\n  y_1 + y_2 = \\frac{x_1^2 + x_2^2}{4f}\n  \\]\n- We can express \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2\\) in terms of \\(x_1 + x_2\\) and \\(x_1 x_2\\):\n  \\[\n  x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1 x_2\n  \\]\n- Substitute \\(x_1 x_2 = -16f^2\\):\n  \\[\n  x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 + 32f^2\n  \\]\n- Therefore:\n  \\[\n  y_1 + y_2 = \\frac{(x_1 + x_2)^2 + 32f^2}{4f}\n  \\]\n  \n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Is this expression useful?  \n  *Yes, it connects \\(y_1 + y_2\\) with \\(x_1 + x_2\\), which is what we need for the midpoint.*\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The expression is getting a bit complicated.\n- Maybe there's a simpler way, but for now, let's continue and see if it simplifies later.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- Continue with the current path and simplify the midpoint coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Expressing the Midpoint \\(M\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Substitute the expressions we've derived into the formula for \\(M\\).\n- Aim to simplify the expression to identify the locus \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\).\n\n**Action:**\n\n- The x-coordinate of \\(M\\):\n  \\[\n  m_x = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\n  \\]\n- The y-coordinate of \\(M\\):\n  \\[\n  m_y = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{(x_1 + x_2)^2 + 32f^2}{4f} = \\frac{(x_1 + x_2)^2 + 32f^2}{8f}\n  \\]\n  \n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Do these expressions make sense?  \n  *Yes, they correctly represent the midpoint coordinates.*\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The expressions are still a bit unwieldy.\n- It might help to introduce a substitution to simplify them.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- Let's set \\(s = x_1 + x_2\\) to streamline the expressions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Substituting \\(s = x_1 + x_2\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- By introducing \\(s = x_1 + x_2\\), we can rewrite the midpoint coordinates in terms of \\(s\\).\n- This substitution should help in identifying the locus equation.\n\n**Action:**\n\n- The x-coordinate of \\(M\\):\n  \\[\n  m_x = \\frac{s}{2}\n  \\]\n- The y-coordinate of \\(M\\):\n  \\[\n  m_y = \\frac{s^2 + 32f^2}{8f}\n  \\]\n  \n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Is this substitution helpful?  \n  *Yes, it simplifies the expressions and makes the next steps clearer.*\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- With these expressions, we can now attempt to find a relationship between \\(m_x\\) and \\(m_y\\) to describe the locus \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Finding the Locus \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) of \\(M\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- We need to eliminate \\(s\\) to express \\(m_y\\) solely in terms of \\(m_x\\).\n- Since \\(m_x = \\frac{s}{2}\\), we can express \\(s = 2m_x\\) and substitute into \\(m_y\\).\n\n**Action:**\n\n- Substitute \\(s = 2m_x\\) into \\(m_y\\):\n  \\[\n  m_y = \\frac{(2m_x)^2 + 32f^2}{8f} = \\frac{4m_x^2 + 32f^2}{8f} = \\frac{m_x^2 + 8f^2}{2f}\n  \\]\n  \n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does this look like the equation of a parabola?

  "ground_truth": "Since all parabolas are similar, we may assume that $\\mathcal P$ is the curve $y = x^2,$ so $V_1 = (0,0).$  Then, if $A = (a, a^2)$ and $B = (b, b^2)$, the slope of line $AV_1$ is $a,$ and the slope of line $BV_1$ is $b.$  Since $\\angle AV_1 B = 90^\\circ,$ $ab = -1$. Then, the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is \\[\n\\left( \\frac{a+b}{2}, \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2}, \\frac{(a+b)^2 - 2ab}{2} \\right)\n= \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2}, \\frac{(a+b)^2}{2} + 1 \\right).\n\\](Note that $a+b$ can range over all real numbers under the constraint $ab = - 1$.)
