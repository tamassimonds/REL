    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll walk you through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, reflecting and adjusting my strategies along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe equation given is:\n\n\\[ ax^2 + 20x + 7 = 0 \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is a nonzero constant. We need to find the value of \\( x \\) that satisfies this equation **when there is only one solution**.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Single Solution in Quadratics:** From my experience with quadratic equations, I recall that a quadratic equation has only one solution (a repeated root) when its **discriminant is zero**.\n\n- **Discriminant Idea:** The discriminant (\\(\\Delta\\)) for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by \\( b^2 - 4ac \\). If \\(\\Delta = 0\\), the equation has exactly one real solution.\n\n- **Alternative Methods:** I could also consider completing the square or using the quadratic formula directly, but leveraging the discriminant seems straightforward for identifying conditions of a single solution.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I'll proceed with the discriminant approach to determine the condition on \\( a \\) and then find the solution for \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Discriminant Condition**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's set up the condition for the equation to have only one solution.\n\n- The general form of a quadratic is \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n- Here, \\( a = a \\), \\( b = 20 \\), and \\( c = 7 \\).\n\n**Setting the Discriminant to Zero:**\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = 0 \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ 20^2 - 4(a)(7) = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 400 - 28a = 0 \\]\n\n**Solving for \\( a \\):**\n\n\\[ 400 = 28a \\]\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{400}{28} \\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{100}{7} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems correct. By setting the discriminant to zero, I've found that \\( a \\) must be \\(\\frac{100}{7}\\) for the quadratic to have only one solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Single Solution \\( x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I know \\( a = \\frac{100}{7} \\), I can substitute this back into the original equation and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ ax^2 + 20x + 7 = 0 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a = \\frac{100}{7} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{100}{7}x^2 + 20x + 7 = 0 \\]\n\n**Multiplying Through by 7 to Eliminate the Denominator:**\n\nThis will make the equation easier to handle.\n\n\\[ 100x^2 + 140x + 49 = 0 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nMultiplying through by 7 simplifies the coefficients, making it more straightforward to apply the quadratic formula or factor if possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince we know the discriminant is zero, the quadratic has a **double root**. I can use the quadratic formula, but it simplifies to finding the vertex of the parabola.\n\n**Using the Quadratic Formula:**\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}}{2a} \\]\n\nBut since the discriminant is zero:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{{-b}}{2a} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ b = 140, \\quad a = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{{-140}}{2 \\times 100} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{{-140}}{200} \\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[ x = -\\frac{7}{10} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense. The single solution is the vertex of the parabola, and the calculation seems straightforward. Let me double-check the arithmetic:\n\n- \\( 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\)\n- \\(-\\frac{140}{200} = -\\frac{7}{10}\\)\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt's always good to verify the solution by plugging it back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies it.\n\n**Substituting \\( x = -\\frac{7}{10} \\) into the Original Equation:**\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{100}{7}x^2 + 20x + 7 = 0 \\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\( x^2 \\):**\n\n   \\[ x = -\\frac{7}{10} \\]\n   \n   \\[ x^2 = \\left(-\\frac{7}{10}\\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{100} \\]\n\n2. **First Term:**\n\n   \\[ \\frac{100}{7} \\times \\frac{49}{100} = \\frac{49}{7} = 7 \\]\n\n3. **Second Term:**\n\n   \\[ 20 \\times \\left(-\\frac{7}{10}\\right) = -14 \\]\n\n4. **Third Term:**\n\n   \\[ 7 \\]\n\n**Adding Them Together:**\n\n\\[ 7 - 14 + 7 = 0 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe left-hand side equals zero, which matches the right-hand side of the equation. This confirms that \\( x = -\\frac{7}{10} \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully applying the discriminant condition, solving for \\( a \\), and then finding the corresponding \\( x \\), I've verified that the solution satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-\\frac{7}{10}} \\]",

  "ground_truth": "For a quadratic to have only one solution, the discriminant must be 0. Therefore, we have the equation $20^2-4 \\cdot a \\cdot 7=0$. Solving, we get $400-28a=0$. Therefore, $a=\\frac{400}{28}=\\frac{100}{7}$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, $ \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a} $, we get the solution $ \\frac{-20\\pm\\sqrt{0}}{2 \\cdot \\frac{100}{7}} = -20 \\cdot \\frac{7}{200} = \\boxed{-\\frac{7}{10}}$."
