When I first read it, I see two points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on the curve of \\(f(x) = \\ln x\\), with \\(0 < x_1 < x_2\\). The points \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) trisect the line segment \\(\\overline{AB}\\), and there's a horizontal line through \\(C\\) that intersects the curve at \\(E\\).\n\n**User Query**: \n_\"Find \\(x_3\\) if \\(x_1 = 1\\) and \\(x_2 = 1000\\)._\n\nHmm, okay. The first thing that comes to mind is that this involves finding coordinates of certain points related to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). I know \\(A(1, \\ln 1)\\) and \\(B(1000, \\ln 1000)\\). Trisecting \\(\\overline{AB}\\) means dividing it into three equal segments, so points \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) would be located at one-third and two-thirds of the way from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\).\n\nBut wait, before jumping in, I should consider a few different strategies:\n\n1. **Calculate the coordinates of \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) directly.**\n   \n2. **Use the midpoint formula to find \\(C\\) and \\(D\\).**\n   \n3. **Visualize or sketch it out to better understand the position of \\(C\\) and the horizontal line.**\n\nThinking about it, the midpoint method might be the most straightforward for finding \\(C\\) and \\(D\\), but since we're trisecting, maybe I should adjust that. Also, ensuring the horizontal line through \\(C\\) intersects the curve correctly is key.\n\nLet me start by trying to find the coordinates of \\(C\\) and \\(D\\), then see how that helps with locating \\(E\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Find Coordinates of \\(C\\) and \\(D\\)**\n\nTo trisect \\(\\overline{AB}\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) should divide the line segment into three equal parts. So, let's find the coordinates of these points.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(A(1, \\ln 1) = (1, 0)\\)\n- \\(B(1000, \\ln 1000)\\)\n\nFirst, I need to find the differences in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 1000 - 1 = 999\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = \\ln 1000 - 0 = \\ln 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, since \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) trisect \\(\\overline{AB}\\), the differences should be:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta x_C = \\frac{\\Delta x}{3} = \\frac{999}{3} = 333\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta y_C = \\frac{\\Delta y}{3} = \\frac{\\ln 1000}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coordinates of \\(C\\) are:\n\n\\[\nC\\left(x_1 + \\frac{\\Delta x}{3}, y_1 + \\frac{\\Delta y}{3}\\right) = \\left(1 + 333, \\frac{\\ln 1000}{3}\\right) = (334, \\frac{\\ln 1000}{3})\n\\]\n\nAnd for \\(D\\):\n\n\\[\nD\\left(x_1 + \\frac{2\\Delta x}{3}, y_1 + \\frac{2\\Delta y}{3}\\right) = \\left(1 + 666, \\frac{2\\ln 1000}{3}\\right) = (667, \\frac{2\\ln 1000}{3})\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: \nLet\u2019s quickly check these calculations:\n\n- \\(x\\) coordinate of \\(C\\): \\(1 + 333 = 334\\), which makes sense.\n- \\(y\\) coordinate of \\(C\\): \\(\\frac{\\ln 1000}{3}\\) seems reasonable since \\(\\ln 1000 \\approx 6.907\\), so dividing by 3 gives approximately 2.302.\n\nThat looks correct. Now, onto finding \\(E\\) by drawing a horizontal line through \\(C\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Finding the Horizontal Line Through \\(C\\)**\n\nThe horizontal line through \\(C\\) will have a constant \\(y\\) value equal to the \\(y\\) coordinate of \\(C\\), which is \\(\\frac{\\ln 1000}{3}\\).\n\nSo, the equation of the horizontal line passing through \\(C\\) is:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{\\ln 1000}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Brainstorming**: \nWait, is \\(E\\) the point where this line intersects the curve \\(f(x) = \\ln x\\)? If so, I need to find \\(x_3\\) such that \\(f(x_3) = \\frac{\\ln 1000}{3}\\).\n\nBut before proceeding, let me verify if this makes sense. The problem asks for \\(x_3\\), and since \\(E\\) is on the curve, I should be able to find \\(x_3\\) by plugging into the equation of the curve.\n\nThat seems logical. Let's continue.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Solving for \\(x_3\\)**\n\nWe know that \\(E\\) lies on the curve \\(f(x) = \\ln x\\) and also on the horizontal line \\(y = \\frac{\\ln 1000}{3}\\). Therefore, at point \\(E\\),\n\n\\[\n\\ln x_3 = \\frac{\\ln 1000}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(x_3\\), I need to exponentiate both sides:\n\n\\[\nx_3 = e^{\\frac{\\ln 1000}{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation**:\n\nRecall that \\(e^{\\ln a} = a\\), so:\n\n\\[\nx_3 = e^{\\ln 1000^{1/3}} = 1000^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s compute \\(1000^{1/3}\\):\n\n\\[\n1000 = 10^3 \\Rightarrow 1000^{1/3} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: \nHmm, that seems surprisingly neat. Let me double-check. If \\(x_3 = 10\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\ln 10 = \\frac{\\ln 1000}{3}\n\\]\n\nChecking this:\n\n\\[\n\\ln 1000 = 3 \\ln 10 \\implies \\frac{\\ln 1000}{3} = \\ln 10\n\\]\n\nWhich aligns perfectly. So, \\(x_3 = 10\\) is indeed correct.\n\n---\n\n**Final Check**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let\u2019s ensure everything aligns with the problem statement:\n\n1. **Coordinates of \\(C\\)**: \n   - \\(C(334, \\frac{\\ln 1000}{3})\\) is correctly calculated.\n   \n2. **Horizontal Line Through \\(C\\)**: \n   - \\(y = \\frac{\\ln 1000}{3}\\) makes sense.\n   \n3. **Point \\(E\\)**: \n   - Lies on both the horizontal line and the curve, satisfying \\(f(x_3) = \\ln x_3 = \\frac{\\ln 1000}{3}\\).\n   \n4. **Final Answer**: \n   - \\(x_3 = 10\\), which fits all conditions.\n\nEverything checks out. The steps lead logically from finding the coordinates of \\(C\\) to determining \\(x_3\\), and the calculations align correctly.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully exploring different strategies, calculating the necessary coordinates, and verifying each step, the solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]\n\nThis approach ensures that each part of the problem is addressed systematically, reflecting natural human thinking with checks and adjustments along the way.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $C$ is the trisector of line segment $\\overline{AB}$ closer to $A$, the $y$-coordinate of $C$ is equal to two thirds the $y$-coordinate of $A$ plus one third the $y$-coordinate of $B$. Thus, point $C$ has coordinates $(x_0, \\frac{2}{3} \\ln 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000) = (x_0, \\ln 10)$ for some $x_0$. Then the horizontal line through $C$ has equation $y = \\ln 10$, and this intersects the curve $y = \\ln x$ at the point $(10, \\ln 10)$, so $x_3 = \\boxed{10}$."
