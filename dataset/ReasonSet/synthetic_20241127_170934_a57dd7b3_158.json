  "solution": "Absolutely, let's craft a polished solution by organizing the thought process while maintaining the final answer. We'll ensure each step flows naturally, reflecting a thorough problem-solving approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the product of the third and sixth terms, \\( a_3a_6 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Arithmetic Sequence Basics:**  \n   An arithmetic sequence has each term increasing by a common difference \\( d \\). Knowing this, we can express terms in relation to each other.\n\n2. **Expressing Terms Algebraically:**  \n   Maybe expressing \\( a_4 \\) and \\( a_5 \\) in terms of the first term \\( a_1 \\) and \\( d \\) will help set up an equation.\n\n3. **Integer Constraints:**  \n   Since the sequence consists of integers and 13 is a prime number, \\( a_4 \\) and \\( a_5 \\) must be integer factors of 13. This limits the possible values significantly.\n\n4. **Exploring Different Strategies:**  \n   - **Option 1:** Set up equations using the properties of arithmetic sequences.\n   - **Option 2:** Consider possible integer pairs that multiply to 13.\n\n   I\u2019ll start by trying to express the terms algebraically. If that gets complicated, I might switch to considering integer factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expressing Terms Algebraically**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s recall how an arithmetic sequence works. The \\( n \\)-th term is given by:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n\\]\n\n**Applying to Our Problem:**\n- **Fourth Term:**  \n  \\[\n  a_4 = a_1 + 3d\n  \\]\n  \n- **Fifth Term:**  \n  \\[\n  a_5 = a_1 + 4d\n  \\]\n\n**Setting Up the Given Equation:**  \n\\[\na_4a_5 = 13 \\implies (a_1 + 3d)(a_1 + 4d) = 13\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis forms a quadratic equation in terms of \\( a_1 \\) and \\( d \\). Solving it could give us the values we need. But wait, solving quadratics with two variables isn't straightforward. Maybe there's a better way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering Integer Factors**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nDealing with two variables here might get messy. Since 13 is a prime number, its factors are limited. Perhaps I can simplify the problem by considering the possible integer values of \\( a_4 \\) and \\( a_5 \\).\n\n**New Strategy:**  \nGiven that \\( a_4a_5 = 13 \\) and 13 is prime, the only integer pairs \\((a_4, a_5)\\) are \\((1, 13)\\) and \\((13, 1)\\). But since the sequence is increasing, \\( a_4 < a_5 \\), so the only valid pair is \\( a_4 = 1 \\) and \\( a_5 = 13 \\).\n\n**Wait a Minute:**  \nActually, there's another possibility considering negative integers: \\((-1, -13)\\). But since the sequence is increasing, and we usually assume \\( d > 0 \\), this might not apply. However, I should keep it in mind just in case.\n\n**Conclusion of This Step:**  \nFor an increasing sequence:\n\\[\na_4 = 1, \\quad a_5 = 13\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Common Difference \\( d \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I know \\( a_4 \\) and \\( a_5 \\), I can find the common difference \\( d \\).\n\n**Using the Formula:**  \n\\[\na_5 = a_4 + d \\implies 13 = 1 + d \\implies d = 12\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, if \\( a_4 = 1 \\) and \\( d = 12 \\), then \\( a_5 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\). So, it's correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the First Term \\( a_1 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWith \\( d = 12 \\), I can find \\( a_1 \\) using \\( a_4 \\).\n\n\\[\na_4 = a_1 + 3d \\implies 1 = a_1 + 3 \\times 12 \\implies 1 = a_1 + 36 \\implies a_1 = 1 - 36 = -35\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet\u2019s verify:\n\\[\na_1 = -35, \\quad d = 12\n\\]\n\\[\na_4 = -35 + 3 \\times 12 = -35 + 36 = 1\n\\]\nThis matches our earlier assignment of \\( a_4 = 1 \\). So, it's correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding \\( a_3 \\) and \\( a_6 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to find \\( a_3 \\) and \\( a_6 \\) to calculate \\( a_3a_6 \\).\n\n- **Third Term:**  \n  \\[\n  a_3 = a_1 + 2d = -35 + 2 \\times 12 = -35 + 24 = -11\n  \\]\n  \n- **Sixth Term:**  \n  \\[\n  a_6 = a_1 + 5d = -35 + 5 \\times 12 = -35 + 60 = 25\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet\u2019s see if these make sense in the sequence:\n\n\\[\na_1 = -35, \\quad a_2 = -35 + 12 = -23, \\quad a_3 = -11, \\quad a_4 = 1, \\quad a_5 = 13, \\quad a_6 = 25\n\\]\n\nThe sequence is increasing with a common difference of 12. Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating \\( a_3a_6 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFinally, compute the product \\( a_3a_6 \\).\n\n\\[\n<a3a6\\) is indeed \\( -275 \\). So, it seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Reflecting on the Solution**\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?**  \n  Yes, all the steps check out. The common difference is consistent, and the terms of the sequence align with the given conditions.\n  \n- **Alternative Strategies:**  \n  Initially, I considered solving a quadratic equation, but realizing the simplicity of integer factors made the problem more straightforward.\n\n- **Was There an Easier Way?**  \n  Yes, focusing on the integer factors of 13 and using the properties of arithmetic sequences simplified the problem significantly.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully analyzing the problem, exploring different strategies, and checking each step along the way, **I arrived at the correct solution**: \\( a_3a_6 = -275 \\).\n\n---\n\nThere we go! By organizing the solution this way, it reflects a natural, thoughtful progression from understanding the problem to arriving at the final answer, ensuring each step is clear and logically connected.",
  "ground_truth": "The only ways to write 13 as the product of two integers is as $13 = 1 \\times 13$ or $13 = (-1) \\times (-13)$.  We take these two cases separately.\n\nIn the case $13 = 1 \\times 13$, we must have $a_4 = 1$ and $a_5 = 13$, since the sequence is increasing.  Then the common difference is $13 - 1 = 12$, so $a_3 = a_4 - 12 = 1 - 12 = -11$, and $a_6 = a_5 + 12 = 13 + 12 = 25$, so $a_3 a_6 = (-11) \\cdot 25 = -275$.\n\nIn the case $13 = (-1) \\times (-13)$, we must have $a_4 = -13$ and $a_5 = -1$.  Then the common difference is $-1 - (-13) = 12$, so $a_3 = a_4 - 12 = -13 - 12 = -25$, and $a_6 = a_5 + 12 = (-1) + 12 = 11$, so $a_3 a_6 = (-25) \\cdot 11 = -275$.\n\nHence, $a_3 a_6 = \\boxed{-275}$."
