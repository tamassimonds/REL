    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it like I would if I were tackling it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking my work frequently. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll proceed:\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I think, \"This looks like geometry involving cylinders and spheres\u2014maybe something about inscribed shapes?\" I remember dealing with similar problems before, where you have to find volumes of different 3D shapes and compare them. \n\nWhat stands out to me:\n\n1. **Inscribed Cylinder in a Sphere**: I recall that when a cylinder is inscribed in a sphere, there are specific relationships between their dimensions.\n   \n2. **Volume Calculation**: I need to find the volume of space inside the sphere but outside the cylinder. This reminds me of finding the difference between two volumes.\n\n3. **Expressing Volume in Terms of \u03c0**: The answer involves \u03c0, which is common in volume problems involving circles and spheres.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Maybe I should explore different strategies to see which one works best.\n\n---\n\n## **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nHere are a few approaches I can think of:\n\n1. **Use Geometric Relationships**: Leverage the fact that the cylinder is inscribed in the sphere to find a relationship between the radius and height of the cylinder.\n\n2. **Volume Formulas**: Directly apply the volume formulas for the sphere and the cylinder and subtract the cylinder's volume from the sphere's volume.\n\n3. **Visual Representation**: Draw a diagram to better understand the dimensions and how the cylinder fits inside the sphere.\n\n4. **Pythagorean Theorem**: Since we're dealing with right cylinders and spheres, maybe the Pythagorean theorem can help relate the dimensions.\n\nHmm, reflecting on these, I think combining the **Geometric Relationships** with **Volume Formulas** might be the most straightforward. But let's see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Inscribed Cylinder**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe problem states that a right cylinder with a base radius of 3 units is inscribed in a sphere of radius 5 units. My initial thought is to visualize this:\n\n- The cylinder sits perfectly inside the sphere, touching the sphere at the circular bases and the lateral sides.\n- This implies that the sphere's radius relates to both the cylinder's radius and its height.\n\n**Possible Approach:**\n\nMaybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem here, considering the diagonal of the cylinder relates to the sphere's diameter.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\nLet's check if this makes sense:\n\n- The diameter of the sphere is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) units.\n- For a right cylinder, the diagonal \\(d\\) can be found using:\n  \\[\n  d = \\sqrt{(2r_{\\text{cylinder}})^2 + h_{\\text{cylinder}}^2}\n  \\]\n  where \\(r_{\\text{cylinder}} = 3\\) units.\n\nBut wait, I don't know the height \\(h_{\\text{cylinder}}\\) yet. Hmm, maybe I need another relationship to find \\(h_{\\text{cylinder}}\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Relating Cylinder Dimensions to Sphere Radius**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI recall from similar problems that for a cylinder inscribed in a sphere, there's a relationship involving the radius of the sphere \\(R\\) and the height \\(h\\) of the cylinder.\n\n**Formula I Remember:**\n\nFor a right circular cylinder inscribed in a sphere:\n\\[\nR = \\sqrt{r_{\\text{cylinder}}^2 + \\left(\\frac{h_{\\text{cylinder}}}{2}\\right)^2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(r_{\\text{cylinder}} = 3\\) units and \\(R = 5\\) units.\n\n**Possible Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s solve for \\(h_{\\text{cylinder}}\\):\n\n\\[\n5 = \\sqrt{3^2 + \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n25 = 9 + \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n16 = \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{h}{2} = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad h = 8 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? The height of the cylinder is 8 units, and the sphere's diameter is 10 units. So the cylinder fits perfectly inside the sphere. Yep, that seems correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Calculating the Volumes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have both the radius and height of the cylinder, I can calculate the volumes:\n\n1. **Volume of the Sphere \\(V_{\\text{sphere}}\\)**\n2. **Volume of the Cylinder \\(V_{\\text{cylinder}}\\)**\n\nThen, the volume of the space inside the sphere but outside the cylinder is:\n\\[\nV = V_{\\text{sphere}} - V_{\\text{cylinder}}\n\\]\n\n**Volume Formulas:**\n\n- **Sphere:** \n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (5)^3 = \\frac{500}{3} \\pi \\text{ cubic units}\n  \\]\n\n- **Cylinder:** \n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r_{\\text{cylinder}}^2 h_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72 \\pi \\text{ cubic units}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s compute these:\n\n- \\(V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 125 = \\frac{500}{3} \\pi\\)\n- \\(V_{\\text{cylinder}} = 72 \\pi\\)\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, does this look right? Let's make sure:\n\n- The sphere's volume should be larger than the cylinder's because the cylinder is contained within the sphere. \n- \\(\\frac{500}{3} \\pi \\approx 523.6\\pi\\) and \\(72 \\pi = 226.4\\pi\\), so the difference makes sense.\n\nYeah, that adds up. The sphere's volume is significantly larger than the cylinder's.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Finding the Volume Difference**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find the volume of the space inside the sphere but outside the cylinder:\n\n\\[\nV = V_{\\text{sphere}} - V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\left(\\frac{500}{3} \\pi - 72 \\pi\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Expression:**\n\nLet\u2019s combine the terms:\n\n\\[\nV = \\left(\\frac{500}{3} \\pi - \\frac{216}{3} \\pi\\right) = \\left(\\frac{500 - 216}{3}\\right) \\pi = \\left(\\frac{284}{3}\\right) \\pi\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs this the expected form? The problem asks for \\(W\\pi\\), where \\(W\\) is a common fraction. So, \\(\\frac{284}{3}\\) makes sense as \\(W\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Final Reflection and Answer**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Calculation Flow:** \n  - I started by determining the height of the cylinder using the relationship between the cylinder and sphere radii.\n  - Then, I calculated the volumes of both the sphere and the cylinder.\n  - Finally, I found the volume difference.\n\n- **Reasoning:**\n  - Every step logically followed the previous one.\n  - The volumes were calculated correctly.\n  - The subtraction was straightforward.\n\n- **Answer Format:**\n  - The final volume is expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\), matching the problem's requirement.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nW = \\frac{284}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the total volume \\(W\\pi\\) is \\(\\frac{284}{3} \\pi\\), and \\(W = \\frac{284}{3}\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of the Thinking Process**\n\n1. **Brainstorming:** \n   - Explored different strategies, settled on using geometric relationships and volume formulas.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Approach:** \n   - Determined the cylinder's height using the sphere's radius.\n   - Calculated the volumes of both shapes.\n   - Found the difference to get the required volume.\n\n3. **Continuous Reflection:** \n   - Checked the validity of each step.\n   - Ensured calculations made sense numerically and contextually.\n\n4. **Final Verification:**\n   - Confirmed that the answer was in the correct format.\n   - Rechecked volume calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nThroughout the process, I kept verifying if each step made sense, allowing me to catch any potential errors early and adjust the approach as needed. This methodical approach ensures a reliable and accurate solution.\n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you have more questions or need further clarification.",
