    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm various strategies, check my work often, and reflect to make sure I'm on the right track. Writing it out like I'm thinking through it will help capture the natural flow of problem-solving, including any mistakes or insights along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is **|x - 3| = 2x + 4**. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like an absolute value equation. I remember that absolute value equations can have multiple solutions because the expression inside the absolute value can be positive or negative.\n  \n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Split into Two Cases:** Reflecting on how absolute value equations typically work, I can set up two separate equations to handle the positive and negative scenarios.\n  2. **Graphical Approach:** Maybe plotting both sides of the equation might give me a visual understanding of the solutions.\n  3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Attempting to simplify and reorganize the equation to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n- **Thinking:** Wait a minute, the **|x - 3|** suggests that the distance between **x** and **3** is involved, so the right side being **2x + 4** adds a linear component. This mix might lead to one or two intersection points.\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Splitting into Two Cases**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s try the most straightforward method: splitting the absolute value into two separate cases based on the definition of absolute value.\n\n- **Case 1:** **x - 3 \u2265 0** \u21d2 |x - 3| = x - 3\n- **Case 2:** **x - 3 < 0** \u21d2 |x - 3| = -(x - 3) = -x + 3\n\n**Proceeding with Case 1:**\n\n1. **Given:** x - 3 \u2265 0 \u21d2 |x - 3| = x - 3\n2. **Equation:** x - 3 = 2x + 4\n3. **Solving for x:**\n   - x - 3 = 2x + 4\n   - Rearranging: -3 - 4 = 2x - x\n   - Simplifying: -7 = x\n\n**Thought:** \n\nHmm, x = -7. But, wait a second, I assumed **x - 3 \u2265 0**, which means **x \u2265 3**. \n\n- **Check:** x = -7 does not satisfy x \u2265 3. So, this solution is **invalid** within this case.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis implies that there might be no valid solution in Case 1. Let\u2019s see how Case 2 works out.\n\n**Proceeding with Case 2:**\n\n1. **Given:** x - 3 < 0 \u21d2 |x - 3| = -x + 3\n2. **Equation:** -x + 3 = 2x + 4\n3. **Solving for x:**\n   - -x + 3 = 2x + 4\n   - Rearranging: 3 - 4 = 2x + x\n   - Simplifying: -1 = 3x\n   - Therefore, x = -1/3\n\n**Check:**\n\nx = -1/3 satisfies **x - 3 < 0** (since -1/3 < 3).\n\n**Conclusion for Case 2:**\n\nThis solution is **valid**.\n\n**Natural Check:**\n\n- So far, it seems like Case 1 didn\u2019t yield a valid solution, while Case 2 did. That\u2019s interesting. Maybe x = -1/3 is the only solution.\n\n### **Checking the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's plug x = -1/3 back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies.\n\n1. **Original Equation:** |x - 3| = 2x + 4\n2. **Substituting x = -1/3:**\n   - Left Side: |-1/3 - 3| = |-1/3 - 9/3| = |-10/3| = 10/3\n   - Right Side: 2(-1/3) + 4 = -2/3 + 4 = -2/3 + 12/3 = 10/3\n\n**Check:**\n\nBoth sides equal 10/3. \n\n- **Thought:** Perfect! The solution x = -1/3 satisfies the original equation.\n\n### **Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thinking:** \n\nWhile splitting into two cases worked, maybe there's another approach to double-check the validity or find the solution differently.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Graphical Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nPlotting the two sides of the equation might visually show where they intersect, confirming our algebraic solution.\n\n1. **Graphs to Plot:**\n   - y = |x - 3|\n   - y = 2x + 4\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- **y = |x - 3|:** This is a V-shaped graph with a vertex at x = 3.\n- **y = 2x + 4:** A straight line with a slope of 2.\n\n**Intersection Point:**\n\nFrom the previous case, we found x = -1/3 as a solution. \n\n**Check:**\n\nWhen x = -1/3:\n- y = |x - 3| = | -1/3 - 3 | = | -10/3 | = 10/3\n- y = 2x + 4 = 10/3\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe intersection point is indeed x = -1/3, confirming our earlier solution.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure there are no other solutions, let's reconsider both cases comprehensively and verify our alternative strategy.\n\n- **Case 1:** Attempted to solve for x \u2265 3 but found no valid solution.\n- **Case 2:** Successfully found x = -1/3, which satisfies the condition.\n- **Graphical Approach:** Confirmed the intersection point aligns with our algebraic solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nx = -1/3 is the **only solution** that satisfies the equation **|x - 3| = 2x + 4**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**x = -\\frac{1}{3}**\n\n---\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and confirming the solution through multiple methods, we've ensured that the approach is correct and the solution is valid. This human-like thinking process, complete with checks and adjustments, mirrors how one would naturally solve a problem on paper.",

  "ground_truth": "We can split the expression $|x-3|=2x+4$ into two separate cases. In the first case, \\begin{align*} x-3&=2x+4\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad -x&=7\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=-7\n\\end{align*}However if we plug this value of $x$ back into the original equation $|x-3|=2x+4$, we get that $|-7-3|=2(-7)+4$ or $10=-10$. Since this is clearly not a valid statement, the first case gives us no possible solutions.\n\nIn the second case, \\begin{align*} x-3&=-(2x+4)\n\\\\ x-3&=-2x-4\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 3x&=-1\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=-\\frac13.\n\\end{align*}If we plug $-\\frac13$ back into the initial equation, we get that $\\left|-\\frac13-3\\right|=2\\left(-\\frac13\\right)+4$ which simplifies to $\\frac{10}{3}=\\frac{10}{3}$. Since this is true, we can accept $x=-\\frac13$ as a valid solution to the equation. Therefore, the only value of $x$ that satisfies the given equation is $\\boxed{-\\frac13}$."
