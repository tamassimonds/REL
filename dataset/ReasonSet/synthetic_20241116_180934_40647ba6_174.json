    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle the problem step by step, thinking through it as naturally as possible\u2014brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting, and checking along the way. I'll treat this like a human would, making sure to catch any missteps and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, the problem is about finding the **range** of the function \n\n\\[\nr(x) = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}.\n\\]\n\nWhen I first see this, I remember that the **range** of a function is all the possible output values (in this case, \\( r(x) \\)) that result from valid input values (\\( x \\)). \n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Graph the Function:** Plotting it might give me a visual idea of the range.\n2. **Algebraic Analysis:** Analyzing the function mathematically to find minimum and maximum values.\n3. **Calculus Approach:** Using derivatives to find critical points.\n4. **Substitution Method:** Seeing how different \\( x \\) values affect \\( r(x) \\).\n\nHmm, initially, graphing seems straightforward, but I know that not all functions can be easily graphed by hand. Maybe combining graphing with algebraic analysis would be more reliable.\n\n**Wait, thinking about it...** I should probably start with an algebraic approach to get a clearer idea before deciding if graphing is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the Function Algebraically**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s look at the function: \n\n\\[\nr(x) = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}.\n\\]\n\n- The denominator **\\((1 - x)^2\\)** is a squared term. \n- Squared terms are always **positive**, meaning \\((1 - x)^2 > 0\\) for all \\( x \\neq 1\\).\n- Therefore, \\( r(x) \\) should be **defined and positive** for all \\( x \\) except \\( x = 1\\) where the denominator becomes zero.\n\n**Checking If This Makes Sense:**\n\nHmm, so \\( r(x) \\) is undefined at \\( x = 1 \\). That\u2019s important because it might affect the range.\n\n**Inspiration Strikes:**\n\nOh! Since \\((1 - x)^2\\) is always positive except at \\( x = 1\\), \\( r(x) \\) should always be a **positive** value. This suggests that the range might only include positive numbers.\n\nBut wait, to be more sure, I should probably explore further\u2014maybe test some specific \\( x \\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Testing Specific \\( x \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s pick a few \\( x \\) values to see how \\( r(x) \\) behaves.\n\n- **Case 1:** \\( x = 0 \\)\n\n\\[\nr(0) = \\frac{1}{(1 - 0)^2} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n\\]\n\n- **Case 2:** \\( x = 2 \\)\n\n\\[\nr(2) = \\frac{1}{(1 - 2)^2} = \\frac{1}{(-1)^2} = 1\n\\]\n\n- **Case 3:** \\( x = -1 \\)\n\n\\[\nr(-1) = \\frac{1}{(1 - (-1))^2} = \\frac{1}{(2)^2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so for \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\), \\( r(x) \\) is \\( 1 \\). For \\( x = -1 \\), \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{4} \\). This indicates that \\( r(x) \\) can take on different positive values depending on \\( x \\).\n\n**Wait a minute, though\u2026** Does this mean the range includes all positive numbers? Let me think about it a bit more.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nAh, I see that as \\( x \\) moves away from 1 (to both sides), \\((1 - x)^2\\) increases, making \\( r(x) \\) smaller. But since it\u2019s a squared term, \\( r(x) \\) never actually reaches zero. It only approaches it as \\( x \\) goes to \\( \\pm \\infty \\).\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\nSo, \\( r(x) \\) gets larger as \\( x \\) moves away from 1, but can it ever be zero? No, because the denominator can\u2019t be zero, and \\( r(x) \\) is always positive. This suggests that the range might be all positive real numbers.\n\nBut\u2026 **is that exhaustive?** Maybe I should check using another method to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Different Strategies\u2014Using Graphing**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nOkay, let\u2019s consider graphing the function to confirm our findings. This might help visualize how \\( r(x) \\) behaves.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBut\u2026 I don\u2019t have graphing tools here. **Wait, I can sketch it mentally.**\n\n- The function has a **vertical asymptote** at \\( x = 1 \\) because \\( r(x) \\) is undefined there.\n- As \\( x \\) approaches 1 from the left (\\( x \\to 1^-\\)), \\( r(x) \\) goes to \\( \\infty \\).\n- As \\( x \\) approaches 1 from the right (\\( x \\to 1^+\\)), \\( r(x) \\) also goes to \\( \\infty \\).\n- For \\( x < 1 \\) and \\( x > 1 \\), \\( r(x) \\) takes positive values, decreasing as \\( |x| \\) increases.\n\n**Hmm, does this align with what I calculated earlier?**\n\nYes, it seems to confirm that \\( r(x) \\) is always positive except at \\( x = 1 \\) where it\u2019s undefined.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\nMaybe I don\u2019t need to graph it formally if the algebraic analysis is clear. But visualizing helps solidify my understanding.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Checking the Approach\u2014Does It Make Sense?**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo far, from testing specific \\( x \\) values and considering the graph, it looks like \\( r(x) \\) is always positive. The only point where it\u2019s undefined is at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n**Wait, but\u2014**\n\nCould there be any other \\( x \\) values that affect the range? Thinking back, the only issue was \\( x = 1\\) causing the denominator to be zero. Otherwise, \\( (1 - x)^2 \\) is always positive, so \\( r(x) \\) is always defined and positive.\n\n**Conclusion So Far:**\n\nIt seems like the range of \\( r(x) \\) is all positive real numbers, but I still want to ensure there are no missed cases.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Revisiting Strategy\u2014Considering Calculus for Verification**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nMaybe using derivatives could help confirm that there are no maximum or minimum points within the domain (except at \\( x = 1 \\)).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s find the derivative \\( r'(x) \\) to see how \\( r(x) \\) changes with \\( x \\).\n\n\\[\nr(x) = (1 - x)^{-2}\n\\]\n\nUsing the **power rule** and **chain rule**:\n\n\\[\nr'(x) = -2(1 - x)^{-3} \\cdot (-1) = \\frac{2}{(1 - x)^3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this derivative is always positive for \\( x \\neq 1 \\) because the denominator is a cube of a positive number.\n\n**Checking This Makes Sense:**\n\nSo, \\( r'(x) > 0 \\) for all \\( x \\neq 1 \\), meaning \\( r(x) \\) is **increasing** everywhere except at \\( x = 1\\). This confirms that as \\( x \\) moves away from 1, \\( r(x) \\) gets smaller.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nAh, this supports the idea that \\( r(x) \\) can take on any positive value because there are no local maxima or minima\u2014just a continuous decrease as \\( x \\) moves away from 1.\n\n**Wait a minute, though\u2026**\n\nDoes this imply that \\( r(x) \\) covers all positive values?\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\nYes, because:\n\n- As \\( x \\to 1^- \\), \\( r(x) \\to \\infty \\).\n- As \\( x \\to \\pm \\infty \\), \\( r(x) \\to 0^+ \\).\n\nSo, \\( r(x) \\) decreases from \\( \\infty \\) to \\( 0 \\), covering all positive values along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Check\u2014Ensuring No Cases Are Missed**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHave I considered all possible \\( x \\) values?\n\n- The only point where \\( r(x) \\) is undefined is at \\( x = 1 \\).\n- For all other \\( x \\), \\( r(x) \\) is defined and positive.\n\n**Pause and Think:**\n\nIs there any other \\( x \\) value that could affect the range? I can\u2019t think of any. **Wait, perhaps testing values closer to 1 would be insightful.**\n\n**Testing:**\n\n- **\\( x = 0.9 \\):**\n\n\\[\nr(0.9) = \\frac{1}{(1 - 0.9)^2} = \\frac{1}{0.1^2} = 100\n\\]\n\n- **\\( x = 1.1 \\):**\n\n\\[\nr(1.1) = \\frac{1}{(1 - 1.1)^2} = \\frac{1}{(-0.1)^2} = 100\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, even values close to 1 still yield large \\( r(x) \\) values, supporting the conclusion that \\( r(x) \\) covers all positive numbers.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\nWait, does this mean the range is **all** positive real numbers, like \\( (0, \\infty) \\)? Let\u2019s see.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Confirming the Range\u2014Final Conclusion**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBased on all the analysis:\n\n- \\( r(x) \\) is **undefined** at \\( x = 1\\).\n- As \\( x \\) approaches 1 from either side, \\( r(x) \\to \\infty \\).\n- As \\( x \\) moves towards \\( \\pm \\infty \\), \\( r(x) \\to 0^+ \\).\n- The function is **increasing** for all \\( x \\neq 1\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe range of \\( r(x) \\) is all positive real numbers: \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(0, \\infty)}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense because:\n\n- The function is always positive except where it\u2019s undefined.\n- It decreases continuously from \\( \\infty \\) to \\( 0 \\) as \\( x \\) moves away from 1.\n\nI feel confident that the range is indeed \\( (0, \\infty) \\). All strategies\u2014algebraic analysis, testing specific values, and calculus verification\u2014point to this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap of the Process:**\n\n1. **Analyzed the Function:** Identified that \\( r(x) \\) is positive for \\( x \\neq 1\\).\n2. **Tested Specific Values:** Confirmed that \\( r(x) \\) takes on different positive values.\n3. **Considered Graphing:** Visualized the behavior around the asymptote.\n4. **Used Calculus:** Verified that \\( r(x) \\) is always decreasing, covering all positive values.\n5. **Final Check:** Ensured no cases were missed, confirming the range as \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n\nThroughout, I paused to reflect, ensured each step aligned with the conclusion, and adjusted the approach as needed. This thorough checking gives confidence in the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy treating the problem like a human, tracking thoughts, exploring multiple strategies, and continuously checking work, I arrived at the range of \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} \\) confidently as \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(0, \\infty)}.\n\\]\n\nThis approach ensures a deep understanding and minimizes the chances of oversight, leading to an accurate solution.",
