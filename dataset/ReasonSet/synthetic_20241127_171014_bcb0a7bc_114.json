  "problem": "When the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two integers are multiplied, the product is 180. How many different values could be the greatest common divisor of the two integers?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I'd approach it if I were working through it myself.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem states that the product of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two integers is 180. Right off the bat, I remember a property from number theory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b\n\\]\n\nBut here, we're given:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCD} \\times \\text{LCM} = 180\n\\]\n\nSo, GCD and LCM are connected through their product being 180. **Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Use the GCD and LCM relationship to find possible pairs.\n- **Strategy 2:** Factorize 180 to see how GCD and LCM could multiply to it.\n- **Strategy 3:** List all divisors of 180 and check which could be GCDs.\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards factorizing 180 since it might help in breaking down the possible values for GCD and LCM. But let's explore multiple strategies to ensure we're on the right path.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Using GCD and LCM Relationship**\n\nLet's assume the two integers are \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = 180\n\\]\n\nWait a minute... I realize that knowing the product is 180 doesn't directly give me the integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) unless I know their LCM or GCD. This approach feels a bit abstract without additional information.\n\n**Reflection:** This strategy isn't directly helpful because we don't have specific values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Maybe I need to think differently.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Factorizing 180**\n\nAlright, let's factorize 180 to see its prime components:\n\n\\[\n180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** By breaking 180 into its prime factors, I can better understand how GCD and LCM relate to each other. The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors, and the LCM is the product of the highest powers.\n\n**Wait, what?** This reminds me that the GCD and LCM are inherently connected through the prime factors of the numbers involved. Let's dig deeper.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Listing All Divisors of 180**\n\nMaybe listing all divisors of 180 could help identify possible GCDs.\n\n**List of Divisors:**  \n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, 180\n\n**Possible GCDs:** Since the GCD must be a divisor of both numbers, any of these could potentially be the GCD.\n\n**Reflection:** This feels promising. Now, I need to check which of these divisors can pair with an LCM to multiply to 180.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementing Strategy 3: Testing Divisor Pairs**\n\nLet's take each divisor and see if there exists an LCM such that their product is 180.\n\n**Step 1: Start with the Smallest Divisor**\n\n- **GCD = 1:**  \n  \\[\n  1 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 180\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 2:**  \n  \\[\n  2 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 90\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 3:**  \n  \\[\n  3 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 60\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 4:**  \n  \\[\n  4 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 45\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 5:**  \n  \\[\n  5 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 36\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 6:**  \n  \\[\n  6 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 30\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 9:**  \n  \\[\n  9 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 20\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 10:**  \n  \\[\n  10 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 18\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 12:**  \n  \\[\n  12 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 15\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 15:**  \n  \\[\n  15 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 12\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 18:**  \n  \\[\n  18 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 10\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 20:**  \n  \\[\n  20 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 9\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 30:**  \n  \\[\n  30 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 6\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 36:**  \n  \\[\n  36 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 5\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 45:**  \n  \\[\n  45 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 4\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 60:**  \n  \\[\n  60 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 3\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 90:**  \n  \\[\n  90 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 2\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n- **GCD = 180:**  \n  \\[\n  180 \\times \\text{LCM} = 180 \\implies \\text{LCM} = 1\n  \\]  \n  *Possible.*\n\n---\n\n### **Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Wait, does this make sense?** All divisors of 180 seem to work as possible GCDs with corresponding LCMs. But let me double-check if each pair makes sense in terms of actual integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Thought Process:** For each GCD and LCM pair, there should exist integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that their GCD and LCM are exactly those values. Let's test a few to be sure.\n\n**Testing a Few Pairs:**\n\n- **GCD = 6, LCM = 30:**  \n  Possible integers: \\( a = 6, b = 30 \\)  \n  \\(\\text{GCD}(6, 30) = 6\\) and \\(\\text{LCM}(6, 30) = 30\\)  \n  *Checks out!*\n\n- **GCD = 12, LCM = 15:**  \n  Possible integers: \\( a = 12, b = 15 \\)  \n  \\(\\text{GCD}(12, 15) = 3\\), but we need GCD = 12...  \n  *Wait, this doesn't work!*  \n\n**Reflection:** Hmm, this pair doesn't satisfy the condition. Maybe not all divisor pairs are valid. I need to rethink my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-evaluating Strategy 3: Filtering Valid GCDs**\n\n**New Thought:** Perhaps only certain divisors of 180 can be GCDs where the corresponding LCM and GCD multiply to 180 and still adhere to the properties of GCD and LCM.\n\n**Check:** The GCD must divide both numbers, and the LCM must be a multiple of both numbers. This means that \\( \\text{GCD} \\times \\text{LCM} = a \\times b = 180 \\). Therefore, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be multiples of the GCD.\n\n**Implementing the Check:**  \nFor a given GCD \\( g \\), let\u2019s see if there exist integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that:\n\n\\[\na = g \\times m \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = g \\times n\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are co-prime (i.e., \\(\\text{GCD}(m, n) = 1\\)), and their LCM is \\( \\frac{180}{g} \\).\n\n**Step 2: Re-testing Valid Pairs**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the earlier pairs with this new insight.\n\n- **GCD = 1:**  \n  \\[\n  a = 1 \\times m, \\quad b = 1 \\times n, \\quad \\text{LCM} = 180\n  \\]  \n  *Valid:* Any co-prime \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) whose LCM is 180.\n\n- **GCD = 2:**  \n  \\[\n  a = 2 \\times m, \\quad b = 2 \\times n, \\quad \\text{LCM} = 90\n  \\]  \n  *Valid:* \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are co-prime, and their LCM is 45.\n\n- **GCD = 3:**  \n  \\[\n  a = 3 \\times m, \\quad b = 3 \\times n, \\quad \\text{LCM} = 60\n  \\]  \n  *Valid:* \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are co-prime, and their LCM is 20.\n\n- **GCD = 4:**  \n  \\[\n  a = 4 \\times m, \\quad b = 4 \\times n, \\quad \\text{LCM} = 45\n  \\]  \n  *Valid:* \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are co-prime, and their LCM is 11.25...  \n  *Wait, LCM must be an integer!*  \n  *Invalid.*\n\n**Reflection:** Ah, I see. For GCD = 4, the corresponding LCM would need to be a non-integer, which isn't possible. So, not all divisors of 180 are valid GCDs. I need to filter out such cases.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Strategy: Filtering Valid GCDs**\n\nOnly those divisors \\( g \\) of 180 for which \\( \\frac{180}{g} \\) is an integer and can be the LCM of two co-prime multiples of \\( g \\) are valid GCDs.\n\n**Step 3: Listing Valid GCDs**\n\nLet's list only those divisors where \\( \\frac{180}{g} \\) is an integer and makes sense as an LCM.\n\n- **GCD = 1:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 1 = 180\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 2:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 2 = 90\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 3:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 3 = 60\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 5:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 5 = 36\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 6:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 6 = 30\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 9:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 9 = 20\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 10:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 10 = 18\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 12:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 12 = 15\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 15:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 15 = 12\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 18:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 18 = 10\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 20:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 20 = 9\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 30:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 30 = 6\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 36:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 36 = 5\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 45:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 45 = 4\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 60:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 60 = 3\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 90:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 90 = 2\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n- **GCD = 180:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 180 = 1\\)  \n  *Valid.*\n\n**Invalid GCDs:**  \n- **GCD = 4:**  \n  \\(\\text{LCM} = 180 / 4 = 45\\), but LCM must be a multiple of both numbers, and 45 cannot be an LCM of multiples of 4 where GCD is 4.  \n  *Invalid.*\n\n- **GCD = 8, 16, etc.:**  \n  Any divisor of 180 that, when multiplied by its corresponding LCM, doesn't satisfy the properties of GCD and LCM.\n\n**Final List of Valid GCDs:**\n\n1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, 180\n\n**Total Count:** 17 valid GCDs.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Does this make sense?** Let's verify by considering a few cases:\n\n- **GCD = 3, LCM = 60:**  \n  Possible integers: \\( a = 3 \\times 4 = 12, b = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\)  \n  \\(\\text{GCD}(12, 15) = 3\\) and \\(\\text{LCM}(12, 15) = 60\\)  \n  *Checks out!*\n\n- **GCD = 10, LCM = 18:**  \n  Possible integers: \\( a = 10 \\times 1 = 10, b = 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\)  \n  \\(\\text{GCD}(10, 90) = 10\\) and \\(\\text{LCM}(10, 90) = 90\\)  \n  *Oops, LCM should be 18...*  \n  *Wait, this doesn't work!*  \n\n**Reflection:** Hmm, seems like there might still be an issue. Perhaps not all listed GCDs are valid after all.

  "ground_truth": "We know that $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  Hence, in this case, $ab = 180$.
