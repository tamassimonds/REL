    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem the way I'd approach it naturally, brainstorming and reflecting along the way. I'll start by exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like a human would think through a math problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I see the problem \\(\\frac{5}{2+\\sqrt{6}}\\), my immediate reaction is that this looks like a typical rationalization of the denominator problem. I remember dealing with similar fractions where the goal is to eliminate the square root in the denominator. \n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.\n  \n  This reminds me of how I\u2019ve handled rationalizing expressions before. The conjugate method seems straightforward because it leverages the difference of squares to eliminate the square root.\n\n- **Strategy 2:** Simplify the fraction by breaking down the numerator and denominator separately.\n  \n  This might get messy because dealing with square roots in both parts could complicate things.\n\n- **Strategy 3:** Use binomial expansion if needed.\n  \n  This feels like overkill for a simple rationalization problem.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe conjugate method stands out as the most efficient approach. It\u2019s direct and aligns well with what I\u2019ve learned about rationalizing denominators with square roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Conjugate Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI\u2019ll proceed with multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \\(2 - \\sqrt{6}\\). This should help eliminate the square root in the denominator.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{2+\\sqrt{6}} \\times \\frac{2-\\sqrt{6}}{2-\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{5(2-\\sqrt{6})}{(2+\\sqrt{6})(2-\\sqrt{6})}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Denominator:**\n\n\\[\n(2+\\sqrt{6})(2-\\sqrt{6}) = 2^2 - (\\sqrt{6})^2 = 4 - 6 = -2\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Numerator:**\n\n\\[\n5(2-\\sqrt{6}) = 10 - 5\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\n**Putting It Together:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 - 5\\sqrt{6}}{-2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute. The denominator simplifies to \\(-2\\), which makes the fraction negative. That doesn't seem right because we usually prefer a positive denominator in such cases. But mathematically, it's still valid.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s verify if multiplying by the conjugate worked correctly.\n\n- Numerator: \\(5 \\times (2 - \\sqrt{6}) = 10 - 5\\sqrt{6}\\)\n- Denominator: \\(2^2 - (\\sqrt{6})^2 = 4 - 6 = -2\\)\n\nBoth calculations seem correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to simplify \\(\\frac{10 - 5\\sqrt{6}}{-2}\\). Dividing each term in the numerator by \\(-2\\) should work.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{-2} - \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{-2} = -5 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reordering the Terms:**\n\nTo match the format \\(\\frac{A\\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\\), I\u2019ll write it as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2} - 5 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{6} - 10}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow it looks like \\(\\frac{5\\sqrt{6} - 10}{2}\\), which fits the required format. But initially, I mixed up the signs, leading to \\(-5 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2}\\). Reordering the terms corrected this.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- Numerator: \\(10 - 5\\sqrt{6} = 5(\\sqrt{6} - 2)\\)\n- Dividing by \\(-2\\): \\(-5 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2}\\) aligns with \\(\\frac{5\\sqrt{6} - 10}{2}\\)\n\nEverything seems to check out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying Constants \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe expression is now in the form \\(\\frac{A\\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\\). I need to identify \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) to find \\(A + B + C + D\\).\n\n**Identification:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5\\sqrt{6} - 10}{2} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad A = 5, \\; B = 6, \\; C = -10, \\; D = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, does this satisfy the condition that \\(B\\) is not divisible by the square of any prime? Here, \\(B = 6\\), which is \\(2 \\times 3\\), and neither 2 nor 3 is a square. That\u2019s acceptable.\n\nAlso, the greatest common divisor (Gcd) of \\(A\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) should be 1.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- \\(A = 5\\)\n- \\(C = -10\\)\n- \\(D = 2\\)\n\nGcd(5, -10, 2) = 1, since 5 is prime and does not divide 2.\n\nEverything seems to fit the requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I simply need to add the constants \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) to find the final answer.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nA + B + C + D = 5 + 6 - 10 + 2 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat\u2019s odd. Adding them up gives 3. Just to be sure, let\u2019s double-check the constants:\n\n- \\(A = 5\\)\n- \\(B = 6\\)\n- \\(C = -10\\)\n- \\(D = 2\\)\n\nCalculation:\n\n\\[\n5 + 6 = 11\n\\]\n\\[\n11 - 10 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n1 + 2 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThe addition is correct. Maybe the initial expectation was incorrect, but mathematically, this aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nThis was a straightforward rationalization problem once the right strategy was identified\u2014multiplying by the conjugate. Initially, there was a slight mix-up with the signs, but reordering the terms clarified the expression. Throughout the process, checking each step ensured the correctness of the solution. The final answer makes sense, and all conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step approach, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and frequent checks, ensures a thorough and human-like handling of the problem, leading to an accurate solution.",
