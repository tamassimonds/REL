    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to ensure I'm on the right track, check my work regularly, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it manually.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe problem states:\n\nWhat's the value of \\( c \\) such that \\( x \\cdot (3x + 1) < c \\) if and only if \\( x \\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\)?\n\nImmediately, a few things come to mind:\n\n- **Inequality and Quadratic Expression:** We're dealing with an inequality involving a quadratic expression \\( x \\cdot (3x + 1) \\). Quadratics often remind me of parabolas, their graphs, and how they can have specific ranges for \\( x \\) where they are above or below a certain value.\n  \n- **Interval Specification:** The solution set is given as \\( x \\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\). This is an open interval, meaning the endpoints are not included. It makes me think about the nature of the quadratic\u2014specifically, how the parabola behaves within this interval.\n\n- **Value of \\( c \\):** We're looking for a specific value \\( c \\) that defines the upper bound of the quadratic within this interval. This reminds me of finding the vertex of a parabola or determining its maximum or minimum value within a given range.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Maybe I can find the maximum or minimum value of the quadratic within the given interval and set \\( c \\) to that value.\n  \n- **Strategy 2:** Alternatively, I could try to determine the points where the quadratic equals \\( c \\) and see how they relate to the specified interval.\n\n- **Strategy 3:** Perhaps graphing the quadratic function would help visualize where it lies relative to \\( c \\) and the given interval.\n\nI'm leaning towards **Strategy 1**\u2014finding the maximum value of the quadratic within the interval\u2014because it seems straightforward. But before proceeding, I'll jot down what each approach entails and their potential pitfalls.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Finding the Maximum Value**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Determine the maximum value of the quadratic function \\( f(x) = x \\cdot (3x + 1) \\) within the interval \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\).\n  \n- **Step 2:** Set \\( c \\) equal to this maximum value since the inequality \\( f(x) < c \\) should hold for all \\( x \\) in the given interval.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Differentiate the Function to Find Critical Points:**\n\n   To find the maximum, I'll differentiate \\( f(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and set the derivative equal to zero.\n\n   \\[\n   f(x) = x \\cdot (3x + 1) = 3x^2 + x\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(3x^2 + x) = 6x + 1\n   \\]\n   \n   Setting \\( f'(x) = 0 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   6x + 1 = 0 \\implies x = -\\frac{1}{6}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Check If \\( x = -\\frac{1}{6} \\) Lies Within the Interval:**\n\n   The critical point \\( x = -\\frac{1}{6} \\) falls within the interval \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\), so it's relevant.\n\n   **Reflection:** Wait, I should also consider the endpoints of the interval to ensure I'm capturing the maximum value within the entire range, even though it's open.\n\n3. **Evaluate \\( f(x) \\) at the Critical Point and Endpoints:**\n\n   Since the interval is open, we can't evaluate \\( f(x) \\) exactly at \\( x = -\\frac{7}{3} \\) and \\( x = 2 \\), but we can approach these points to determine the behavior of the function.\n\n   - **Limit as \\( x \\) Approaches \\( -\\frac{7}{3} \\):**\n\n     \\[\n     f\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{7}{3} \\cdot \\left(3 \\cdot -\\frac{7}{3} + 1\\right) = -\\frac{7}{3} \\cdot (-7 + 1) = -\\frac{7}{3} \\cdot (-6) = 14\n     \\]\n     \n     But since \\( x = -\\frac{7}{3} \\) is not included, we consider values slightly greater than \\( -\\frac{7}{3} \\).\n\n   - **Limit as \\( x \\) Approaches \\( 2 \\):**\n\n     \\[\n     f(2) = 2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 2 + 1) = 2 \\cdot 7 = 14\n     \\]\n     \n     Similarly, since \\( x = 2 \\) is not included, we consider values slightly less than \\( 2 \\).\n\n4. **Comparison of Values:**\n\n   - As \\( x \\) approaches \\( -\\frac{7}{3} \\) from the right, \\( f(x) \\) approaches 14.\n   - At \\( x = 2 \\), \\( f(x) \\) equals 14.\n\n   **Reflection:** This suggests that the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) within the interval is 14. Therefore, setting \\( c = 14 \\) seems correct.\n\n**Quick Check:** Wait a moment\u2014does this make sense? If \\( c = 14 \\), then \\( f(x) < 14 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\), which aligns with the given condition.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Determining Intersection Points**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Set the quadratic expression equal to \\( c \\) to find the points where \\( f(x) = c \\).\n  \n- **Step 2:** Analyze where these intersection points lie relative to the given interval.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Set \\( f(x) = c \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   x \\cdot (3x + 1) = c \\implies 3x^2 + x - c = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the Roots of the Quadratic Equation:**\n\n   Using the quadratic formula:\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 12c}}{6}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:** This formula gives us the points where \\( f(x) = c \\). We need to see how these roots relate to the interval \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\).\n\n3. **Analyze the Roots:**\n\n   - For \\( c = 14 \\):\n\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 12 \\times 14}}{6} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{6} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 13}{6}\n     \\]\n     \n     So, the roots are:\n     \n     \\[\n     x_1 = \\frac{12}{6} = 2, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{-14}{6} = -\\frac{7}{3}\n     \\]\n     \n     **Observation:** These roots correspond to the endpoints of our interval. Since the given interval is open, \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -\\frac{7}{3} \\) are not included, which aligns with the condition.\n\n**Reflection:** This approach confirms that \\( c = 14 \\) is correct because the quadratic equals 14 at the endpoints, and within the open interval, \\( f(x) < 14 \\).\n\n**Quick Check:** Does setting \\( c = 14 \\) make \\( f(x) < c \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\)? Yes, because the quadratic reaches its maximum value of 14 at the endpoints, which are not included in the interval.\n\n### **Final Strategy: Confirming by Graphical Visualization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Visualize the quadratic function and the horizontal line \\( y = c \\) to see where they intersect.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Ensure that the only intersections within the specified interval are at the endpoints (which are not included).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Sketch the Graph of \\( f(x) \\):**\n\n   - The quadratic \\( f(x) = 3x^2 + x \\) opens upwards (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive).\n   - The vertex of the parabola is at \\( x = -\\frac{1}{6} \\), which lies within the interval \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\).\n   - At the vertex:\n\n     \\[\n     f\\left(-\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = 3\\left(-\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{1}{6} = -\\frac{1}{4}\n     \\]\n     \n     **Reflection:** So, the minimum value within the interval is \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the Maximum Value:**\n\n   - As previously calculated, the maximum value approaches 14 as \\( x \\) approaches the endpoints.\n\n3. **Plotting \\( y = c \\):**\n\n   - A horizontal line at \\( y = 14 \\) intersects the parabola at the endpoints.\n   - Since the interval is open, these points are not included, so \\( f(x) < 14 \\) within the interval.\n\n**Reflection:** This graphical approach aligns with our previous calculations, confirming that \\( c = 14 \\) is indeed the correct value.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies\u2014finding the maximum value through calculus, analyzing intersection points, and visualizing the graph\u2014I confirm that the value of \\( c \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:** Setting \\( c = 14 \\) ensures that \\( f(x) < 14 \\) for all \\( x \\) within the given interval \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\). This is consistent with the problem's requirements and verifies the correctness of the solution.",
