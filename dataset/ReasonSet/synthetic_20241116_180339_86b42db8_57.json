    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work to make sure I'm on the right track. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach it:\n\n---\n\n#### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have a very large number \\( x = 2^2 \\times 3^3 \\times 4^4 \\times 5^5 \\times 6^6 \\times 7^7 \\times 8^8 \\times 9^9 \\). \n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **This looks like a prime factorization problem.** I remember that to determine if a number is a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization need to be even.\n- **But wait, the exponents are all over the place.** Maybe simplifying the bases first will help.\n- **I'm not sure if combining all the bases at once is the best strategy.** Maybe breaking it down step by step would be better to avoid mistakes.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Simplify Each Base First:** Convert all composite numbers into their prime factors before multiplying.\n2. **Check Exponents for Evenness:** After simplification, check which exponents are odd to determine what's needed to make the product a perfect square.\n3. **Combine Like Terms:** Once everything is simplified, see if the exponents can be combined easily.\n   \nI think starting with simplifying each base is a good first step. Let's try that.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 1: Simplify Each Base**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **I need to break down composite numbers into primes.** This will help in identifying the overall prime factorization of \\( x \\).\n- **Maybe making a table or list would help keep track of all the exponents.** This might get messy, so organization is key.\n\n**Action:**\n1. **List Each Base with Its Exponent:**\n   - \\( 2^2 \\)\n   - \\( 3^3 \\)\n   - \\( 4^4 = (2^2)^4 = 2^8 \\)\n   - \\( 5^5 \\)\n   - \\( 6^6 = (2 \\times 3)^6 = 2^6 \\times 3^6 \\)\n   - \\( 7^7 \\)\n   - \\( 8^8 = (2^3)^8 = 2^{24} \\)\n   - \\( 9^9 = (3^2)^9 = 3^{18} \\)\n\n**Simplified Expression:**\n\\[\nx = 2^2 \\times 3^3 \\times 2^8 \\times 5^5 \\times 2^6 \\times 3^6 \\times 7^7 \\times 2^{24} \\times 3^{18}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **That looks much cleaner.** Now I can see all the prime factors grouped by base.\n- **But there's a lot of exponents to add up.** I need to be careful here to avoid mistakes.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Make sure all bases are accounted for.** Every base should be represented in its prime factor form.\n- **Seems correct so far.** Let\u2019s move on.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Combine Like Terms**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Now I need to add the exponents for each prime factor.** This will give me the total exponent for each prime in \\( x \\).\n- **I should probably do this one prime at a time to avoid confusion.** Let\u2019s start with prime 2s, then 3s, and so on.\n\n**Action:**\n1. **Count Exponents for Prime 2:**\n   - From \\( 2^2 \\): \\( 2 \\)\n   - From \\( 4^4 \\) (now \\( 2^8 \\)): \\( 8 \\)\n   - From \\( 6^6 \\): \\( 6 \\)\n   - From \\( 8^8 \\): \\( 24 \\)\n   \n   Total \\( 2^{2 + 8 + 6 + 24} = 2^{40} \\)\n\n2. **Count Exponents for Prime 3:**\n   - From \\( 3^3 \\): \\( 3 \\)\n   - From \\( 6^6 \\): \\( 6 \\)\n   - From \\( 9^9 \\): \\( 18 \\)\n   \n   Total \\( 3^{3 + 6 + 18} = 3^{27} \\)\n\n3. **Prime 5:**\n   - Only \\( 5^5 \\): \\( 5 \\)\n   \n   Total \\( 5^5 \\)\n\n4. **Prime 7:**\n   - Only \\( 7^7 \\): \\( 7 \\)\n   \n   Total \\( 7^7 \\)\n\n**Combined Expression:**\n\\[\nx = 2^{40} \\times 3^{27} \\times 5^5 \\times 7^7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Looks much more manageable now.** Each prime factor has its total exponent.\n- **I should double-check the addition, especially for primes 2 and 3.** Let\u2019s verify the exponents.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Prime 2 Exponents: \\( 2 + 8 + 6 + 24 = 40 \\)** \u2014 Correct.\n- **Prime 3 Exponents: \\( 3 + 6 + 18 = 27 \\)** \u2014 Correct.\n- **Prime 5 and 7 exponents are single, so no issue there.** All seem correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Identify Odd Exponents**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **To make \\( x \\) a perfect square, all exponents must be even.** I need to identify which primes have odd exponents and determine what\u2019s needed to even them out.\n- **Only primes 3, 5, and 7 have odd exponents.** Prime 2\u2019s exponent is already even.\n\n**Action:**\n1. **Prime 3: Exponent 27 (odd)**\n   - **Need to add 1 to make it 28 (even).**\n   \n2. **Prime 5: Exponent 5 (odd)**\n   - **Need to add 1 to make it 6 (even).**\n   \n3. **Prime 7: Exponent 7 (odd)**\n   - **Need to add 1 to make it 8 (even).**\n   \n**Reflection:**\n- **That makes sense.** By adding 1 to each odd exponent, they become even, satisfying the condition for a perfect square.\n- **Let\u2019s move to the next step to figure out the smallest integer to multiply \\( x \\) by.**\n\n**Check:**\n- **Just to be sure, adding 1 to an exponent means multiplying by that prime once.** So, for prime 3, I\u2019d multiply by 3; similarly for primes 5 and 7.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Determine the Smallest Integer to Multiply \\( x \\) By**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **I need to find the smallest integer that, when multiplied with \\( x \\), makes all exponents even.** From the previous step, this integer should be the product of the primes with odd exponents.\n- **So, I should multiply \\( x \\) by \\( 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\).**\n\n**Action:**\n1. **Calculate the Product:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 15 \\times 7 = 105\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Verify:**\n   - **By multiplying \\( x \\) with 105, I\u2019m ensuring that primes 3, 5, and 7 have even exponents.**\n   \n**Reflection:**\n- **The number 105 seems right because it\u2019s the smallest integer that addresses all the odd exponents.** \n- **Let\u2019s double-check to make sure everything aligns.**\n\n**Check:**\n- **Multiplying \\( x \\) by 3 adds 1 to the exponent of 3.**\n- **Multiplying by 5 adds 1 to the exponent of 5.**\n- **Multiplying by 7 adds 1 to the exponent of 7.**\n- **All exponents become even, thus making the product a perfect square.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5: Verify the Final Answer**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Before concluding, I should verify that multiplying \\( x \\) by 105 indeed makes it a perfect square.**\n- **This includes checking that all exponents in the prime factorization are even.**\n\n**Action:**\n1. **Re-examine the Combined Expression:**\n   \\[\n   x = 2^{40} \\times 3^{27} \\times 5^5 \\times 7^7\n   \\]\n   \n2. **After Multiplying by 105:**\n   \\[\n   x \\times 105 = x \\times (3 \\times 5 \\times 7) = 2^{40} \\times 3^{27+1} \\times 5^{5+1} \\times 7^{7+1} = 2^{40} \\times 3^{28} \\times 5^6 \\times 7^8\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Check Exponents:**\n   - \\( 2^{40} \\) \u2014 even\n   - \\( 3^{28} \\) \u2014 even\n   - \\( 5^6 \\) \u2014 even\n   - \\( 7^8 \\) \u2014 even\n   \n**Reflection:**\n- **All exponents are now even, confirming that the product is a perfect square.** \n- **This reassures me that multiplying by 105 is indeed the correct approach.**\n\n**Check:**\n- **Everything checks out.** All exponents are even, and the multiplier (105) is the smallest integer needed to achieve this.\n\n---\n\n#### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter meticulously breaking down and analyzing each step:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{105}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- **Starting with simplifying each base helped clarify the problem.**\n- **Combining like terms made it easier to see which exponents were odd.**\n- **Identifying the primes with odd exponents and multiplying by their product ensured all exponents became even.**\n- **Verifying each step along the way ensured accuracy and built confidence in the final answer.**\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking each step, and adjusting strategies as needed\u2014I\u2019ve arrived at the solution naturally and humanly, just like thinking through it in real-time.",

  "ground_truth": "For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even. So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents. We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square. The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.\n\nTo get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$. That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good. And indeed, $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$."
