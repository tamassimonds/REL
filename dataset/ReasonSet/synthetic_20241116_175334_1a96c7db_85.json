    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, mimicking a human's thought process. We'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect and check our work frequently, and be open to changing our approach if something doesn't seem right. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**User Request:** Simplify \\(\\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i}\\) to the form \\(a+bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers written as improper fractions if necessary.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Fractions Involving Imaginary Numbers:** This reminds me of simplifying fractions with complex numbers. I've done something like this before, I think.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Rationalizing the Denominator:** Multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. This seems like a standard approach for such problems.\n  2. **Direct Division of Complex Numbers:** I remember there\u2019s a method where you separate the real and imaginary parts, but that might get messy.\n  3. **Using Polar Coordinates:** Convert to polar form, simplify, and convert back. But this feels overcomplicated for a simple fraction.\n\n**Wait a minute...** The most straightforward method that pops into my head is rationalizing the denominator. Let\u2019s explore that first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Rationalize the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Rationalizing:** I need to eliminate the imaginary unit \\(i\\) from the denominator. Typically, I multiply by the conjugate.\n- **Conjugate of Denominator:** The denominator is \\(1 + 2i\\), so its conjugate is \\(1 - 2i\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\dfrac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} \\times \\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \\dfrac{(3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)}{(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)}\n\\]\n\n**Fixing a Mistake:**  \n**Wait, let me check...** Multiplying by the conjugate should work. Let's see if I calculated it correctly.\n\n**Checking the Denominator:**\n\\[\n(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - 4(-1) = 1 + 4 = 5\n\\]\n- **Looks good!** The denominator simplifies nicely to a real number.\n\n**Checking the Numerator:**\n\\[\n(3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) = 3(1) + 3(-2i) + 4i(1) + 4i(-2i) = 3 - 6i + 4i - 8i^2\n\\]\n- **Recall:** \\(i^2 = -1\\), so \\(-8(-1) = 8\\).\n- **Simplify:** \\(3 - 6i + 4i + 8 = 11 - 2i\\).\n\n**Result So Far:**\n\\[\n\\dfrac{11 - 2i}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does it make sense?** Yes, the numerator and denominator were simplified correctly.\n- **Quick Check:** Dividing both real and imaginary parts by 5 seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Writing in Standard Form \\(a + bi\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Standard Form:** I need to separate the real and imaginary components.\n- **Division by 5:** Each part should be divided by 5.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2}{5}i\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2}{5}i\n\\]\n\n**Wait, does that look right?** Let's double-check the steps to ensure everything is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Original Expression:** \\(\\dfrac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\)\n- **Rationalized:** \\(\\dfrac{11 - 2i}{5}\\)\n- **Verification:**\n  - Multiply both sides by \\(1 + 2i\\) to see if we retrieve the original numerator:\n    \\[\n    \\left(\\dfrac{11 - 2i}{5}\\right)(1 + 2i) = \\dfrac{(11 - 2i)(1 + 2i)}{5} = \\dfrac{11 + 22i - 2i - 4i^2}{5} = \\dfrac{11 + 20i + 4}{5} = \\dfrac{15 + 20i}{5} = 3 + 4i\n    \\]\n  - **Success!** We arrived back at the original numerator. This confirms that the solution is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Approach Validity:** Rationalizing the denominator worked perfectly here.\n- **Alternative Methods:** I considered direct division and polar coordinates, but rationalizing was the simplest and most effective for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Alternative Strategies (Just in Case)**\n\n**Thinking:** Although rationalizing the denominator yielded the correct answer, it's always good to consider other methods to ensure robustness.\n\n1. **Direct Division of Complex Numbers:**\n   - **Idea:** Separate real and imaginary parts directly by dividing.\n   - **Attempt:** \n     \\[\n     \\dfrac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} = \\dfrac{3}{1} + \\dfrac{4i}{1 + 2i} \n     \\]\n     - **Problem:** Dividing a complex number by another complex number directly can get messy without rationalizing.\n\n2. **Using Polar Coordinates:**\n   - **Idea:** Convert both numerator and denominator to polar form, perform the division, and convert back.\n   - **Problem:** This adds unnecessary complexity for a straightforward fraction.\n\n**Conclusion:** Rationalizing the denominator was the most efficient method for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Correctness:** After verifying by back-substitution, the answer \\(\\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2}{5}i\\) is correct.\n- **Checkpoints:** Throughout the process, I checked each step\u2014especially the multiplication and simplifications\u2014to ensure accuracy.\n- **Reflection:** Maintaining flexibility in approach allowed me to confirm the solution's validity and consider alternative methods, though they weren't needed in this case.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2}{5}i\n\\]\n\nThis approach ensured a clear, step-by-step journey through the problem, reflecting the natural thought process of brainstorming, attempting a solution, checking for correctness, and being open to exploring different strategies.",
