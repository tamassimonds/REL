    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's make sure to think like a human would, with all the natural thinking, confusion, and insights that come along.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see the problem:\n\n**User Query:**\nIf \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) are positive 4-digit integers such that \\( \\gcd(k, \\ell) = 3 \\), what is the smallest possible value for \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] \\)?\n\nHmm, this looks like a problem involving the relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm). I remember there's a formula that connects them:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(k, \\ell) \\times \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] = k \\times \\ell\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( \\gcd(k, \\ell) = 3 \\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] = k \\times \\ell\n\\]\n\nSo, the lcm would be:\n\n\\[\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] = \\frac{k \\times \\ell}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, that makes sense because lcm is supposed to be the smallest multiple common to both numbers, and since they share a gcd of 3, dividing their product by 3 should give me lcm. But to minimize lcm, I need to think about how to minimize \\( k \\times \\ell \\).\n\n**Initial Idea:**\nTo minimize \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] \\), I should minimize \\( k \\times \\ell \\). But they need to be 4-digit numbers, and their gcd must be 3. This might involve picking \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) cleverly to balance these constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Approach:**\n   - Express both \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) in terms of their prime factors.\n   - Since \\( \\gcd(k, \\ell) = 3 \\), both \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) must have 3 as a common factor.\n   - Perhaps set \\( k = 3m \\) and \\( \\ell = 3n \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime.\n\n2. **Minimizing the Product \\( k \\times \\ell \\):**\n   - Try to find the smallest possible values for \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) that are 4-digit numbers and satisfy the gcd condition.\n   - Maybe start with the smallest 4-digit multiple of 3 and see if I can find a corresponding \\( \\ell \\).\n\n3. **Using the lcm Formula Directly:**\n   - Use the lcm formula \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] = \\frac{k \\times \\ell}{3} \\) to see how different choices of \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) affect the lcm.\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, the prime factorization approach seems promising because it explicitly accounts for the gcd condition. Minimizing the product also aligns well with minimizing the lcm. I think combining these strategies might work best.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Express \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) in Terms of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\)**\n\nLet's start with the prime factorization approach.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf \\( \\gcd(k, \\ell) = 3 \\), then both \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) must be multiples of 3. Let's set:\n\n\\[\nk = 3m \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\ell = 3n\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\) (i.e., \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis makes sense because factoring out the gcd simplifies the problem. Now, I need to ensure that both \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) are 4-digit numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Range for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\)**\n\nGiven that \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) are 4-digit numbers:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\leq k = 3m < 10000 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{1000}{3} \\leq m < \\frac{10000}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 333.33 \\leq m < 3333.33\n\\]\n\nSince \\( m \\) must be an integer, the possible values for \\( m \\) are:\n\n\\[\n334 \\leq m \\leq 3333\n\\]\n\nSimilarly for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\n1000 \\leq \\ell = 3n < 10000 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 334 \\leq n \\leq 3333\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nAlright, both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) need to be between 334 and 3333. To minimize \\( k \\times \\ell \\), I should pick \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) as small as possible within this range, while ensuring \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\).\n\n**Check:**\nWait, I should confirm that \\( \\frac{10000}{3} \\) rounds down to 3333. Yes, because \\( 10000 \\div 3 = 3333.33 \\), so the upper limit for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) is 3333.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Smallest \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) with \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to find the smallest integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) such that:\n\n- \\( 334 \\leq m, n \\leq 3333 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\)\n\nTo keep \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] \\) minimal, I should start with the smallest possible \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) that are coprime.\n\n**Approach:**\nLet's try \\( m = 334 \\) and see if there's an \\( n \\geq 334 \\) such that \\( \\gcd(334, n) = 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, before proceeding, I should check if 334 has any common factors with numbers just above it. If 334 is divisible by small primes, finding a coprime \\( n \\) might be tricky.\n\n**Check:**\nLet me factor 334:\n\n\\[\n334 = 2 \\times 167\n\\]\n\nSo, 334 is even and has a prime factorization involving 2 and 167.\n\n**Insight:**\nIf \\( n \\) is odd and not divisible by 167, it might be coprime with 334. This gives me a clue.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Selecting \\( n \\) to Ensure \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince \\( m = 334 = 2 \\times 167 \\), \\( n \\) should not be divisible by 2 or 167 to ensure \\( \\gcd(334, n) = 1 \\).\n\n**Strategy:**\nPick the smallest \\( n \\) that is both odd and not divisible by 167:\n\n\\[\nn = 335\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nLet's verify:\n\n\\[\n335 = 5 \\times 67\n\\]\n\n- 335 is odd.\n- 335 is not divisible by 2 or 167.\n\nSo, \\( \\gcd(334, 335) = 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis looks good because \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime, and both are in the 4-digit range when multiplied by 3.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\)**\n\nNow, let's calculate \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\):\n\n\\[\nk = 3m = 3 \\times 334 = 1002\n\\]\n\\[\n\\ell = 3n = 3 \\times 335 = 1005\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth 1002 and 1005 are 4-digit numbers, and their gcd is 3, as required. Let's check if these are indeed the smallest possible \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) that satisfy all conditions.\n\n**Check:**\nWait, could there be smaller \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) that are coprime? But since 334 is already quite small, and \\( n \\) needs to be coprime with 334, which restricts the choices, I think this pair is optimal.\n\n**Insight:**\nChoosing \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) as the smallest coprime pair ensures that their product \\( k \\times \\ell \\) is minimized, leading to the smallest lcm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Least Common Multiple \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have \\( k = 1002 \\) and \\( \\ell = 1005 \\), let's calculate \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] \\):\n\n\\[\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] = \\frac{k \\times \\ell}{\\gcd(k, \\ell)} = \\frac{1002 \\times 1005}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\nFirst, compute \\( 1002 \\times 1005 \\):\n\n\\[\n1002 \\times 1005 = 1002 \\times (1000 + 5) = 1002 \\times 1000 + 1002 \\times 5 = 1002000 + 5010 = 1007010\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] = \\frac{1007010}{3} = 335670\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nLet me verify the multiplication and division steps:\n\n\\[\n1002 \\times 1005 = 1002000 + 5010 = 1007010 \\quad \\text{(correct)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1007010}{3} = 335670 \\quad \\text{(correct)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe lcm calculation seems correct. However, I should check if \\( 335670 \\) is indeed the smallest possible lcm or if there's a more optimal pair \\( (m, n) \\) that I might have missed.\n\n**Insight:**\nSince \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) were chosen to be the smallest coprime integers within the given range, and \\( k \\times \\ell \\) is minimized, I believe \\( 335670 \\) is indeed the smallest possible lcm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying the Optimality of the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure that \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] = 335670 \\) is the smallest possible value, I should confirm that no smaller coprime integers \\( (m, n) \\) exist within the 4-digit range that can replace \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) while still satisfying all conditions.\n\n**Reflection:**\nGiven that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are both at least 334, and \\( m \\) is specifically 334 (the smallest even 4-digit number divisible by 3), any attempt to lower \\( m \\) would result in \\( k \\) being less than 1000, which violates the 4-digit condition.\n\n**Check:**\nSimilarly, increasing \\( n \\) beyond 335 would only increase \\( \\ell \\), and since \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are already at their minimal coprime values that satisfy the gcd condition, it's unlikely that a smaller lcm can be achieved.\n\n**Insight:**\nThe choice of \\( m = 334 \\) and \\( n = 335 \\) is optimal because:\n\n- They are the smallest coprime integers within the required range.\n- This minimizes the product \\( k \\times \\ell \\), thereby minimizing the lcm.\n- Any attempt to lower \\( m \\) or \\( n \\) would either violate the 4-digit condition or increase the lcm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe solution is correct, and \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] = 335670 \\) is indeed the smallest possible value.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's quickly recapitulate the steps to ensure everything aligns:\n\n1. **Expressed \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\) in Terms of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\):**\n   - \\( k = 3m \\), \\( \\ell = 3n \\), \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\)\n\n2. **Determined the Range for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\):**\n   - \\( 334 \\leq m, n \\leq 3333 \\)\n\n3. **Selected the Smallest Coprime \\( m \\) and \\( n \\):**\n   - \\( m = 334 \\), \\( n = 335 \\)\n\n4. **Calculated \\( k \\) and \\( \\ell \\):**\n   - \\( k = 1002 \\), \\( \\ell = 1005 \\)\n\n5. **Computed \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] \\):**\n   - \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] = 335670 \\)\n\n6. **Verified the Optimality:**\n   - No smaller coprime \\( (m, n) \\) within the range that satisfies all conditions.\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The approach was systematic, ensuring that each step logically followed the previous one, and the checks confirm the correctness of the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k, \\ell] = 335670\n\\]\n\n**Final Thought:**\nBy meticulously exploring different strategies, verifying calculations, and ensuring the optimality of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), I've confidently arrived at the smallest possible lcm, which is \\( 335670 \\). This step-by-step approach, coupled with constant reflection and checking, ensures the solution is both accurate and reliable.",
