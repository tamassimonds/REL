However, there's a twist: among these players, there are triplets\u2014Alicia, Amanda, and Anna. The condition is that **at most one** of these triplets can be in the starting lineup. \n\nAt first glance, it seems like a typical combinatorics problem, but the restriction on the triplets complicates things. Maybe we need to account for cases where none or only one of them is included.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Total Combinations Minus Unwanted Cases:** Calculate the total ways to choose 6 players without restrictions and then subtract the cases where more than one triplet is included.\n\n2. **Case-by-Case Analysis:** Consider different scenarios:\n   - No triplets in the lineup.\n   - Exactly one triplet in the lineup.\n\n3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** This might help in managing overlapping cases, but it seems a bit advanced for this problem.\n\n### **Choosing a Strategy:**\n\nThe **Total Combinations Minus Unwanted Cases** approach seems straightforward. Let's start there and see if it works. If it gets messy, we can switch to the **Case-by-Case Analysis.**\n\n---\n\n# **Step 2: Calculating Total Combinations Without Restrictions**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nBefore applying any restrictions, let's see how many ways there are to choose 6 starters out of the 14 players. This is a basic combination problem.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{14}{6} = \\frac{14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 3,003\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so there are 3,003 ways to choose 6 players without considering the triplets' condition. But this includes many lineups where more than one triplet is present, which we need to exclude.\n\n---\n\n# **Step 3: Identifying and Subtracting Unwanted Cases**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nTo satisfy the condition that **at most one** triplet is in the lineup, we need to exclude cases where **two or all three** triplets are included.\n\n### **Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Two Triplets Included:** Calculate the number of lineups where exactly two of the triplets are included.\n\n2. **All Three Triplets Included:** Calculate the number of lineups where all three triplets are included.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\n#### **1. Exactly Two Triplets Included:**\n\n- **Choose 2 out of 3 Triplets:**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{3}{2} = 3 \n  \\]\n  (Possible pairs: Alicia & Amanda, Alicia & Anna, Amanda & Anna)\n\n- **Choose 4 Remaining Players from the Other 11:**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{11}{4} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 330\n  \\]\n\n- **Total for Two Triplets:**\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 330 = 990\n  \\]\n\n#### **2. All Three Triplets Included:**\n\n- **Choose 3 Triplets:**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{3}{3} = 1\n  \\]\n  (Only one way to include all three)\n\n- **Choose 3 Remaining Players from the Other 11:**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 165\n  \\]\n\n- **Total for All Three Triplets:**\n  \\[\n  1 \\times 165 = 165\n  \\]\n\n### **Total Unwanted Cases:**\n\n\\[\n990 \\text{ (two triplets)} + 165 \\text{ (three triplets)} = 1,155\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nSo, there are 1,155 lineups where more than one triplet is included. To satisfy the condition of **at most one triplet**, we need to subtract these from the total.\n\n---\n\n# **Step 4: Calculating the Desired Number of Lineups**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nNow, subtract the unwanted cases from the total combinations to get the number of valid lineups.\n\n### **Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Valid lineups} = \\text{Total combinations} - \\text{Unwanted cases} = 3,003 - 1,155 = 1,848\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nThis gives us 1,848 valid lineups where at most one triplet is included. But let's double-check to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n# **Step 5: Double-Checking with an Alternative Approach**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nIt's always good to verify our answer using a different method to ensure accuracy. Let's try the **Case-by-Case Analysis** approach to see if we arrive at the same number.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\n#### **Case 1: No Triplets in the Lineup**\n\n- **Choose 6 Players from the 11 Non-Triplets:**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{11}{6} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 462\n  \\]\n\n#### **Case 2: Exactly One Triplet in the Lineup**\n\n- **Choose 1 Triplet:**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{3}{1} = 3\n  \\]\n  (Alicia, Amanda, or Anna)\n\n- **Choose 5 Remaining Players from the Other 11:**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{11}{5} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 462\n  \\]\n\n- **Total for One Triplet:**\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 462 = 1,386\n  \\]\n\n### **Total Valid Lineups:**\n\n\\[\n462 \\text{ (no triplets)} + 1,386 \\text{ (one triplet)} = 1,848\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nBoth approaches\u2014subtracting unwanted cases and adding valid cases\u2014yield the same result: **1,848** valid lineups. This consistency strengthens our confidence in the solution.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1,848}\n\\]\n\n**There are 1,848 ways to choose 6 starters from the volleyball team such that at most one of the triplets is included.**\n\n---\n\n# **Step 6: Final Checks and Conclusion**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let's ensure all steps are logical and error-free. Double-checking calculations and reasoning can prevent mistakes.\n\n### **Check 1: Validating Combination Calculations**\n\n- All combination formulas were applied correctly.\n- Calculations for \\(\\binom{14}{6}\\), \\(\\binom{11}{4}\\), \\(\\binom{11}{3}\\), \\(\\binom{11}{6}\\), and \\(\\binom{11}{5}\\) are accurate.\n\n### **Check 2: Consistency Between Methods**\n\n- Both the **Total Minus Unwanted** and **Case-by-Case** approaches agree on the final number of valid lineups.\n\n### **Check 3: Logical Flow**\n\n- The problem's condition was thoroughly addressed by considering all necessary cases (no triplets and exactly one triplet).\n- Unwanted cases (two or three triplets) were correctly identified and subtracted.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe final answer of **1,848** is verified through multiple strategies, ensuring its correctness. By exploring different methods and cross-verifying, we've confidently arrived at the solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1,848}\n\\]\n\n**There are 1,848 ways to select the 6 starters, ensuring that at most one of the triplets is included.**",

  "ground_truth": "We can add together the number of lineups with one triplet and with no triplets.   The number of lineups with no triplets is $\\binom{11}{6} = 462$, since we must choose 6 starters from the 11 remaining players.  When one triplet is in the lineup, there are $3\\cdot \\binom{11}{5} = 1386$ options.  So the total number of lineups with at most one triplet is $1386 + 462 = \\boxed{1848}$."
