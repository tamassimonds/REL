  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, just like how I'd naturally approach it as a human trying to figure it out.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, looking at the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{507}}{\\sqrt{48}} - \\frac{\\sqrt{175}}{\\sqrt{112}}\n\\]\n\nAt first glance, it looks like a subtraction of two fractional square roots. I remember dealing with similar problems before where rationalizing the denominators or simplifying the square roots helped. Maybe that could work here. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure the best way to start, so brainstorming different strategies might be a good idea.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Simplify the Square Roots:** Perhaps I can simplify the square roots in the numerators and denominators. If the numbers inside the square roots have perfect square factors, this could make things easier.\n\n2. **Rationalize the Denominators:** Another approach is to rationalize the denominators to get rid of the square roots at the bottom. I've seen this method used to simplify fractions involving square roots.\n\n3. **Combine the Fractions:** Maybe I can find a common denominator and combine the two fractions into one. This might simplify the expression overall.\n\n4. **Numerical Approximation:** As a last resort, I could approximate the square roots numerically to get a sense of the result, but that wouldn't give me an exact answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Simplify the Square Roots**\n\nLet's start by simplifying the square roots. If it works, great; if not, we can try something else.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify \\(\\sqrt{507}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{48}\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** I need to check if 507 and 48 have perfect square factors.\n\n- **Calculation for \\(\\sqrt{507}\\):**\n\n  - 507 is divisible by 9 (since \\(5 + 0 + 7 = 12\\), and 12 is divisible by 3).\n  - \\(507 \\div 9 = 56.333...\\) Hmm, that's not an integer. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, 9 isn't a perfect square factor. Let's try another perfect square.\n\n  - **Try 81:** \\(507 \\div 81 = 6.259...\\) Nope, not an integer.\n\n  - **Try 3:** \\(507 \\div 3 = 169\\), and 169 is \\(13^2\\).\n\n- **Conclusion:** So, \\(507 = 3 \\times 13^2\\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{507} = \\sqrt{3 \\times 13^2} = 13\\sqrt{3}\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Let me double-check that \\(13^2 = 169\\) and \\(169 \\times 3 = 507\\). Yep, that's correct.\n\n- **Calculation for \\(\\sqrt{48}\\):**\n\n  - **Factor 48:** \\(48 = 16 \\times 3\\), and 16 is \\(4^2\\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{48} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 3} = 4\\sqrt{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Simplify \\(\\sqrt{175}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{112}\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Repeat the same for 175 and 112.\n\n- **Calculation for \\(\\sqrt{175}\\):**\n\n  - **Factor 175:** \\(175 = 25 \\times 7\\), and 25 is \\(5^2\\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{175} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 7} = 5\\sqrt{7}\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculation for \\(\\sqrt{112}\\):**\n\n  - **Factor 112:** \\(112 = 16 \\times 7\\), and 16 is \\(4^2\\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{112} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 7} = 4\\sqrt{7}\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Rewriting the Original Expression**\n\nAfter simplifying, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13\\sqrt{3}}{4\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{4\\sqrt{7}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Reflecting on the Simplification**\n\nWait a minute, this looks promising. I notice that in both fractions, the numerators and denominators have the same square root terms. Maybe I can cancel them out.\n\n**Thought Process:** If the square root terms in the numerator and denominator are the same, they should cancel each other. Let's see if that works.\n\n---\n\n### **Canceling Out the Square Roots**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13\\sqrt{3}}{4\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{13}{4} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{4\\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Simplified Expression:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{4} - \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Simplification**\n\n**Thought Process:** This looks much simpler now. Both fractions have the same denominator, so subtracting them should be straightforward.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{4} - \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{13 - 5}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Natural Check**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, simplifying the square roots and canceling them out led to a straightforward subtraction of fractions.\n- **Is the final answer reasonable?** Absolutely, the steps followed logically, and the arithmetic checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>2</ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies and starting with simplifying the square roots, we were able to simplify the expression effectively. Canceling out the identical square root terms in the numerators and denominators made the problem straightforward, leading us to the final answer of 2. Along the way, reflecting and checking each step ensured the correctness of the approach.\n\nAlright! That wraps it up. By walking through the problem step-by-step, brainstorming different methods, and continuously checking our work, we arrived confidently at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Putting It All Together: A Coherent Solution**\n\n**First Step: Simplifying Square Roots**\n\n1. **Simplify \\(\\sqrt{507}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{48}\\):**\n\n   - \\(\\sqrt{507} = 13\\sqrt{3}\\) because \\(507 = 3 \\times 13^2\\).\n   - \\(\\sqrt{48} = 4\\sqrt{3}\\) because \\(48 = 16 \\times 3\\).\n\n2. **Simplify \\(\\sqrt{175}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{112}\\):**\n\n   - \\(\\sqrt{175} = 5\\sqrt{7}\\) because \\(175 = 25 \\times 7\\).\n   - \\(\\sqrt{112} = 4\\sqrt{7}\\) because \\(112 = 16 \\times 7\\).\n\n**Second Step: Rewriting the Expression**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13\\sqrt{3}}{4\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{4\\sqrt{7}}\n\\]\n\n**Third Step: Canceling Out Square Roots**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{4} - \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Final Step: Performing the Subtraction**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13 - 5}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:** 2",
