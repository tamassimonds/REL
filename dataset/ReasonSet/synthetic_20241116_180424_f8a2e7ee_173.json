    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have triangle \\( ABC \\) which is **isosceles** with side lengths of 25 cm, 25 cm, and 48 cm. The question asks for the **area** of the triangle in square centimeters.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of geometry problems involving finding the area of triangles, especially isosceles ones. I think I might need to use the **Heron's formula** or perhaps the **Pythagorean theorem** since it's isosceles. But wait, the sides are 25, 25, and 48 cm\u2014having two sides equal makes it isosceles for sure.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Heron's Formula:** This is a go-to for finding the area when all side lengths are known.\n  2. **Pythagorean Theorem:** Maybe to find heights or angles.\n  3. **Base and Height Method:** Since it\u2019s isosceles, perhaps dropping a perpendicular from the vertex opposite the base to find the height could work.\n  4. **Coordinate Geometry:** Placing the triangle on a coordinate plane to calculate the area.\n\n- **Exploring Options:** \n  - Heron's formula seems straightforward since all sides are known.\n  - The base and height method also feels intuitive, especially with isosceles triangles.\n  - I'm a bit unsure about using coordinates right now\u2014it might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\n- **Decision:** Let\u2019s start with **Heron's Formula** because it's a well-known method for finding the area with just side lengths. If it doesn't pan out, I'll consider the base-height approach next.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Heron's Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nHeron's formula calculates the area of a triangle when all three sides are known. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle,\n- \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are the side lengths.\n\nSo, I need to find the semi-perimeter first.\n\n**Calculations:**\nGiven:\n- \\( a = 25 \\) cm\n- \\( b = 25 \\) cm\n- \\( c = 48 \\) cm\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} = \\frac{25 + 25 + 48}{2} = \\frac{98}{2} = 49 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's plug \\( s \\), \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) into Heron's formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\sqrt{49 \\times (49 - 25) \\times (49 - 25) \\times (49 - 48)}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{49 \\times 24 \\times 24 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{49 \\times 576}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{28,224}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 168 \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Natural Check:**\n- **Wait a minute:** Does an area of 168 cm\u00b2 seem reasonable for a triangle with sides 25 cm, 25 cm, and 48 cm? Let me think.\n- The base is 48 cm, which is significantly longer than the equal sides (25 cm each). An isosceles triangle with such dimensions should have a substantial area, so 168 cm\u00b2 feels plausible.\n\n- **Reflection:** Heron\u2019s formula seems to have worked correctly. The steps follow logically, and the numbers check out.\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with the Base and Height Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure accuracy, let's try finding the area using the **base and height** method. For isosceles triangles, dropping a perpendicular from the vertex opposite the base to the base can help find the height. With both base and height known, the area calculation is straightforward.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the base: \\( b = 48 \\) cm.\n2. Find the height \\( h \\) using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Since the triangle is isosceles, the height divides the base into two equal parts:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Half of base} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n- Now, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height:\n\n\\[\nh^2 + 24^2 = 25^2\n\\]\n\\[\nh^2 + 576 = 625\n\\]\n\\[\nh^2 = 625 - 576 = 49\n\\]\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{49} = 7 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n- Now, use the base-height formula to find the area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 48 \\times 7 = 168 \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Natural Check:**\n- **Hmm:** Both methods yield an area of 168 cm\u00b2. This consistency is reassuring.\n- It confirms that the calculations were correct in the first step.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Is Heron\u2019s Formula Reliable Here?** Yes, it provided a correct and consistent result with the base-height method.\n- **Does the Area Make Sense?** Given the dimensions, an area of 168 cm\u00b2 seems reasonable.\n- **Check for Mistakes:** Throughout both methods, the calculations align, and the approach logically follows. No discrepancies or errors were encountered.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is **168 square centimeters**. Using both Heron's formula and the base-height method confirms the accuracy of the result. Exploring different strategies and verifying through multiple approaches ensures the solution's correctness.",

Thus, $AD=\\frac{48}{2}=24$. Now we see $ABD$ is a 7-24-25 right triangle, so $BD=7$. Calculating the area of $ABC$, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 48 \\cdot 7=24 \\cdot 7=\\boxed{168} \\text{sq cm}$."
