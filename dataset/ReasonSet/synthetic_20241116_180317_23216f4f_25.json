    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The goal is to find the greatest integer value of \\( b \\) for which the expression \n\n\\[\n\\frac{9x^3 + 4x^2 + 11x + 7}{x^2 + bx + 8}\n\\]\n\nhas a domain of all real numbers. This means that the denominator should never be zero for any real value of \\( x \\). \n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Denominator Analysis:**  \n   - I remember that for a rational expression to have a domain of all real numbers, the denominator must never equal zero. So, I need to ensure that \\( x^2 + bx + 8 = 0 \\) has no real solutions.\n   \n2. **Discriminant Approach:**  \n   - This seems related to quadratic equations and their discriminants. If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots.\n   \n3. **Completing the Square:**  \n   - Another method could be to complete the square to see the vertex of the parabola and ensure it doesn't touch the x-axis.\n   \n4. **Value of \\( b \\):**  \n   - Since the problem asks for the greatest integer value of \\( b \\), I'll need to find the maximum \\( b \\) that satisfies the condition of no real roots.\n\nAt first glance, the discriminant approach seems straightforward. But let me explore each option briefly to see which feels more intuitive or if there's a better method.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's start by examining the quadratic in the denominator: \\( x^2 + bx + 8 \\). For the expression to have a domain of all real numbers, this quadratic must not intersect the x-axis. This happens when:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + bx + 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI should ensure that this equation has no real solutions. To do that, let's look at the discriminant (\\( \\Delta \\)).\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Discriminant**\n\n**Calculation:**  \nThe discriminant of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nFor our denominator:\n\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = b \\) (the coefficient of \\( x \\))\n- \\( c = 8 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 8 = b^2 - 32\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, I need the discriminant to be **less than zero** for there to be no real solutions (i.e., no real roots). So, I need:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 32 < 0\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Inequality**\n\n**Calculation:**  \nLet's solve the inequality:\n\n\\[\nb^2 < 32\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\n|b| < \\sqrt{32}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n|b| < 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Square Root:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{32} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 2} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nHowever, to find the greatest **integer** value of \\( b \\), we need to approximate \\( 4\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n**Approximation:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 1.414 \\approx 5.656\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, \\( b \\) must be between approximately \\( -5.656 \\) and \\( 5.656 \\). Since we're looking for the greatest integer value, \\( b \\) can be at most \\( 5 \\). But before concluding, let's double-check by considering \\( b = 5 \\) and \\( b = 6 \\) to ensure \\( b = 6 \\) doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying \\( b = 5 \\) and \\( b = 6 \\)**\n\n**Checking \\( b = 5 \\):**\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 32 = 5^2 - 32 = 25 - 32 = -7\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince \\( -7 < 0 \\), the quadratic has no real roots. This means the expression has a domain of all real numbers.\n\n**Checking \\( b = 6 \\):**\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 32 = 6^2 - 32 = 36 - 32 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWait, \\( 4 > 0 \\). This means the quadratic \\( x^2 + 6x + 8 \\) has real roots, so the expression would not have a domain of all real numbers.\n\n### **Step 5: Concluding the Greatest Integer Value of \\( b \\)**\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nBased on the analysis:\n\n- \\( b = 5 \\) results in no real roots for the denominator, allowing the expression to have a domain of all real numbers.\n- \\( b = 6 \\) introduces real roots, violating the condition.\n\n**Therefore, the greatest integer value of \\( b \\) for which the expression has a domain of all real numbers is:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Verification:**  \nLet's quickly verify:\n\n- **Discriminant for \\( b = 5 \\):**  \n  \\( 5^2 - 32 = 25 - 32 = -7 \\) (No real roots)\n\n- **Discriminant for \\( b = 6 \\):**  \n  \\( 6^2 - 32 = 36 - 32 = 4 \\) (Real roots)\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEverything checks out. The discriminant confirms that only \\( b = 5 \\) ensures the denominator has no real roots, thus providing a domain of all real numbers for the expression.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "In order for the expression to have a domain of all real numbers, the quadratic $x^2+bx+8 = 0$ must have no real roots.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 8 = b^2 - 32$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 32 < 0$, or $b^2 < 32$.  The greatest integer $b$ that satisfies this inequality is $\\boxed{5}$."
