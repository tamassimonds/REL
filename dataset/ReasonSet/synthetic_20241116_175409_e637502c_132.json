I remember from previous problems that dealing with higher powers can get tricky, especially with **sum of squares** or **difference of squares** concepts. \n\nMy initial thoughts are:\n\n- **Symmetry or Substitution:** Maybe there's a substitution that can simplify the expression. Often, with squared or higher powers, substituting \\(y = x - a\\) works.\n- **Expanding the Binomials:** I could expand \\((x - 3)^4\\) and \\((x - 5)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to see if that leads anywhere.\n- **Factoring Techniques:** Perhaps factoring could help once it's expanded.\n- **Numerical or Graphical Approach:** If algebraic methods seem too complex, maybe plotting the functions could give insights about the roots.\n\nBut wait, before diving in, I should consider **possible strategies** and their practicality. Expanding binomials might lead to a messy equation, and factoring could be challenging without first simplifying. A substitution might streamline things, so I'll explore that first.\n\n## **Step 1: Exploring Substitution**\n\nLet\u2019s try a substitution to simplify the expression. I notice both terms involve fourth powers of expressions with \\(x\\), so maybe letting \\(y = x - a\\) could help.\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n- If I let \\(y = x - 4\\), then:\n  \\[\n  x - 3 = (y + 1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x - 5 = (y - 1)\n  \\]\n- This shifts the equation to:\n  \\[\n  (y + 1)^4 + (y - 1)^4 = -8\n  \\]\n  \nBut then, thinking it through, this only shifts the center of the equation. Maybe it doesn't simplify things significantly.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to simplify the problem enough. Perhaps a different substitution or approach is needed. Maybe targeting symmetry within the equation would help.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Recognizing Symmetry**\n\nI recall that when adding even powers, there's symmetry around the center. The terms \\((x - 3)^4\\) and \\((x - 5)^4\\) are both fourth powers, which are **even functions**, meaning they are symmetric around their midpoints.\n\n**Midpoint of 3 and 5 is 4.**\n\nSo, maybe substituting \\(x = 4 + z\\) could center the equation around zero, simplifying the symmetry. Let\u2019s try that.\n\n## **Step 2: Applying Symmetry Substitution**\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\\[x = 4 + z\\]\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n(4 + z - 3)^4 + (4 + z - 5)^4 = -8\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n(z + 1)^4 + (z - 1)^4 = -8\n\\]\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n- This indeed centers the equation around \\(z = 0\\), exploiting the symmetry.\n- Now, the equation involves sums of even powers, which might be easier to handle.\n\nFeeling encouraged by this substitution, I\u2019ll proceed with expanding \\((z + 1)^4\\) and \\((z - 1)^4\\) to see if patterns emerge.\n\n## **Step 3: Expanding the Binomials**\n\nUsing the **binomial theorem**, let's expand both terms.\n\n\\[(z + 1)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3 + 6z^2 + 4z + 1\\]\n\n\\[(z - 1)^4 = z^4 - 4z^3 + 6z^2 - 4z + 1\\]\n\n### **Adding Both Expansions:**\n\n\\[\n(z + 1)^4 + (z - 1)^4 = (z^4 + 4z^3 + 6z^2 + 4z + 1) + (z^4 - 4z^3 + 6z^2 - 4z + 1)\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n2z^4 + 12z^2 + 2\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n2z^4 + 12z^2 + 2 = -8\n\\]\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n- Wait, I see that by adding these expansions, the odd-powered terms (\\(z^3\\) and \\(z\\)) cancel out due to symmetry. That's neat!\n- This simplifies the equation significantly, leaving only **even powers**.\n\nBut looking at the constant term, I need to **bring -8 to the left side**:\n\\[\n2z^4 + 12z^2 + 2 + 8 = 0 \\implies 2z^4 + 12z^2 + 10 = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n- This looks much cleaner now.\n- The equation is still polynomial but only involves even powers, making it easier to solve.\n\n## **Step 4: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s simplify the equation by factoring out the common multiple.\n\n\\[\n2z^4 + 12z^2 + 10 = 0\n\\]\n\nDivide everything by 2:\n\\[\nz^4 + 6z^2 + 5 = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n- This is still a **quartic equation**, but now it's easier to manage since it's divided by 2.\n- I notice that this resembles a **quadratic in terms of \\(z^2\\)**. Maybe substitution can help again.\n\n## **Step 5: Substituting \\(u = z^2\\)**\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\\[u = z^2\\]\n  \nThen, the equation becomes:\n\\[\nu^2 + 6u + 5 = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n- This is now a **standard quadratic equation**.\n- I remember that quadratics can be solved using the **quadratic formula** or factoring if recognizable.\n\nLet's see if it factors easily:\n\\[\nu^2 + 6u + 5 = (u + 1)(u + 5) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Wait, does it factor?**\nChecking:\n\\[\n(u + 1)(u + 5) = u^2 + 5u + u + 5 = u^2 + 6u + 5 \\quad \\text{(Yep, it factors!)}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n- This is fortunate because factoring makes it easier to find the roots.\n- Alternatively, I could use the quadratic formula, but factoring is quicker here.\n\n## **Step 6: Solving for \\(u\\)**\n\nSet each factor to zero:\n\\[\nu + 1 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad u = -1\n\\]\n\\[\nu + 5 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad u = -5\n\\]\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n- Recall that \\(u = z^2\\), so \\(z^2 = -1\\) or \\(z^2 = -5\\).\n- This means we are dealing with **imaginary numbers** since the squares are negative.\n\nBut before proceeding, let\u2019s consider if this makes sense in the context of the original equation.\n\n### **Reflection:**\n- Our original equation involved even powers, which typically have real solutions.\n- However, through substitution and simplification, we arrived at imaginary solutions.\n- This discrepancy might suggest that our approach needs reevaluation or that the original equation inherently has no real solutions.\n\n## **Step 7: Rechecking the Approach**\n\nLet me backtrack a bit to ensure everything aligns:\n\n1. **Substitution Validity:** Substituting \\(x = 4 + z\\) centered the equation around zero, exploiting symmetry. This seems logically sound.\n  \n2. **Expansion Accuracy:** Expanding \\((z + 1)^4\\) and \\((z - 1)^4\\) correctly led to canceling odd terms, simplifying the equation.\n\n3. **Factoring Correctly:** The quadratic in \\(u\\) factored neatly, yielding imaginary roots.\n\nSo, the steps logically follow, but the presence of imaginary solutions indicates that the original equation has no real solutions.\n\n### **Final Thought:**\n- Sometimes, equations that appear straightforward can lead to unexpected imaginary solutions.\n- This could be a reminder that not all polynomial equations have real roots, especially when transformed through substitutions.\n\n## **Step 8: Concluding the Solutions**\n\nGiven our work, the solutions to the substituted equation are:\n\n\\[\nz^2 = -1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad z = i, \\, -i\n\\]\n\\[\nz^2 = -5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad z = \\sqrt{5}i, \\, -\\sqrt{5}i\n\\]\n\nRecalling that \\(z = x - 4\\), we substitute back to find \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx - 4 = i \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 4 + i\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 4 = -i \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 4 - i\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 4 = \\sqrt{5}i \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 4 + \\sqrt{5}i\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 4 = -\\sqrt{5}i \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 4 - \\sqrt{5}i\n\\]\n\n### **Listing the Solutions:**\nSo, the complete set of solutions is:\n\\[\nx = 4 + i, \\, 4 - i, \\, 4 + \\sqrt{5}i, \\, 4 - \\sqrt{5}i\n\\]\n\n## **Final Reflection and Check**\n\n- **Verification:** Substituting these back into the original equation should yield true, confirming their validity.\n  \n- **Nature of Solutions:** The fact that we have complex solutions suggests that the original equation doesn't intersect the real axis, implying no real \\(x\\) satisfies it.\n\n- **Approach Confirmation:** Starting with a substitution that exploited symmetry was effective in simplifying the equation, leading to manageable quadratic roots.\n\nOverall, by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and being open to adjusting our approach, we successfully navigated through the problem to arrive at the correct solutions.",
