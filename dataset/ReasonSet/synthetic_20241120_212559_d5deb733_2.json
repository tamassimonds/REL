    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem and make sure we get it right this time. I'll start by reflecting on my initial approach, identifying where I went wrong, and then adjusting my strategy accordingly. Here's how I'll proceed:\n\n### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first encounter this problem, a few key elements stand out:\n\n- **Street Setup:** We have parallel curbs 40 feet apart.\n- **Crosswalk Characteristics:** The crosswalk is bounded by two parallel stripes crossing the street at an angle.\n- **Given Measurements:**\n  - The length along the curb between the stripes is 15 feet.\n  - Each stripe is 50 feet long.\n- **Objective:** Find the distance between the stripes.\n\n**First Impression:** I initially thought of using trigonometry to relate the given lengths and angles. However, now that I reflect on it, perhaps there's a more straightforward geometric approach I overlooked.\n\n### **Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\nWait a minute, I think I see where I went wrong. I jumped into using trigonometry without fully exploring simpler geometric relationships. Let me take a step back and consider treating the crosswalk as a geometric shape.\n\n**New Idea:** What if the crosswalk forms a parallelogram? This would allow me to use area calculations to find the distance between the stripes.\n\n### **Step 1: Visualizing the Crosswalk as a Parallelogram**\n\n**Sketching the Scenario:** Imagine the street as a rectangle 40 feet wide. The crosswalk is a parallelogram with:\n\n- **Base along the curb:** 15 feet\n- **Height (distance between curbs):** 40 feet\n- **Stripes:** Each stripe is 50 feet long, acting as the sides of the parallelogram.\n\n**Assumption:** The area of the parallelogram can be calculated in two different ways, which can help us find the missing distance.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Area of the Parallelogram**\n\n**Method 1: Using Base and Height**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height} = 15 \\text{ ft} \\times 40 \\text{ ft} = 600 \\text{ ft}^2\n\\]\n\n**Method 2: Using Stripe Length and Distance Between Stripes**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{Length of Stripe} \\times \\text{Distance Between Stripes} = 50 \\text{ ft} \\times d\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Equating the Two Area Expressions**\n\nSince both expressions represent the same area:\n\n\\[\n600 \\text{ ft}^2 = 50 \\text{ ft} \\times d\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{600 \\text{ ft}^2}{50 \\text{ ft}} = 12 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\n### **Checking the Validity of the Solution**\n\nHmm, looking at this again, it seems much cleaner and straightforward compared to my initial trigonometric approach. But just to be sure, let me double-check the logic:\n\n- **The parallelogram's area remains constant regardless of how we calculate it.**\n- **Using both the base-height and side-distance relationships confirms the consistency.**\n\nThis makes sense! The distance between the stripes is indeed **12 feet**.\n\n### **Reflection and Lessons Learned**\n\n- **Initial Misstep:** I initially overcomplicated the problem by jumping straight into trigonometry.\n- **Importance of Exploring Simpler Methods:** By reconsidering the geometric properties and treating the crosswalk as a parallelogram, the solution became more intuitive and straightforward.\n- **Verification:** Always cross-check different methods to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe distance between the stripes is **12 feet**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThis experience highlights the importance of:\n\n- **Starting with Visualizing the Problem:** A clear mental image can lead to more effective strategies.\n- **Being Open to Changing Approaches:** Recognizing when an initial method isn't yielding the right results and being flexible to explore alternative paths.\n- **Validating Solutions with Multiple Methods:** Ensuring the correctness by applying different techniques and checking for consistency.\n\nBy correcting my initial approach and embracing a geometric perspective, I arrived at the correct and simplified solution.",

But viewed another way, the parallelogram has base 50 feet and altitude equal to the distance between the stripes, so this distance must be $600/50=\\boxed{12}$ feet.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(10,0));\ndraw((0,7)--(10,7));\ndraw((0.5,0)--(0.5,7),Arrows);\nlabel(\"40\",(0.5,3.5),W);\nfill((3,0)--(6,0)--(8,7)--(5,7)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nlabel(\"15\",(4.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"15\",(6.5,7),N);\nlabel(\"50\",(4,3.5),W);\nlabel(\"50\",(7,3.5),E);\ndraw((3,0)--(6,0)--(8,7)--(5,7)--cycle);\n[/asy]"
