I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Question:** For how many three-digit positive integers is the sum of the digits equal to \\(5\\)?\n  \n- **First Reaction:** Okay, this involves three-digit numbers where the sum of the digits is \\(5\\). I remember dealing with similar problems involving digit sums before, so maybe I can use that experience here.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **List All Possible Combinations:** Write down all three-digit numbers whose digits add up to \\(5\\).\n  2. **Use Combinatorics:** Think about distributing a total of \\(5\\) among three digits with certain constraints.\n  3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Consider counting all possibilities and then subtracting the invalid ones.\n  4. **Generating Functions:** Though this might be overkill for small numbers, it's worth considering.\n\n- **Reflection:** Listing all possibilities manually seems time-consuming, especially to ensure each number is a three-digit integer. Combinatorics might be a more structured approach. Let's start with that.\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Combinatorics - Distributing the Sum Among Digits**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Objective:** We need three digits whose sum equals \\(5\\), and the first digit (hundreds place) must be between \\(1\\) and \\(9\\), while the other two digits (tens and units places) can be between \\(0\\) and \\(9\\).\n\n- **Approach:**\n  - Assign the sum \\(5\\) among \\(d_1\\), \\(d_2\\), and \\(d_3\\), where \\(d_1\\) is non-zero.\n  - This can be rephrased: Find non-negative integer solutions to \\(d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 5\\) with \\(1 \\leq d_1 \\leq 9\\).\n\n- **Adjustment:** Since \\(d_1\\) must be at least \\(1\\), let's define \\(d_1' = d_1 - 1\\). This transformation shifts the problem to finding solutions for \\(d_1' + d_2 + d_3 = 4\\), where \\(d_1' \\geq 0\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Total Non-Negative Solutions Without Constraint:** Use the stars and bars theorem.\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of solutions} = \\binom{4 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{6}{2} = 15\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Wait, this counts all solutions, but we need to ensure \\(d_1 \\leq 9\\). However, since we're dealing with a sum of \\(4\\), and \\(d_1\\) is at least \\(1\\), the maximum \\(d_1\\) can be is \\(4\\), which is within the \\(1\\) to \\(9\\) range.\n\n**Conclusion:** All \\(15\\) solutions are valid because \\(d_1\\) can't exceed \\(4\\) when the total sum is \\(5\\).\n\n- **Check:** Does it make sense that \\(d_1\\) can be at most \\(4\\) in a sum of \\(5\\)? Yes, because if \\(d_1\\) were \\(5\\) or more, \\(d_2\\) and \\(d_3\\) would have to be negative, which isn't possible.\n\n### **Step 3: Enumerating the Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Objective:** List all possible combinations to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Method:** Generate all non-negative integer solutions to \\(d_1' + d_2 + d_3 = 4\\) and map them back to \\(d_1\\), \\(d_2\\), and \\(d_3\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Generating Solutions:**\n  - \\(d_1' = 0\\): \\(d_2 + d_3 = 4\\) \u2192 Solutions: \\((0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0)\\)\n  - \\(d_1' = 1\\): \\(d_2 + d_3 = 3\\) \u2192 Solutions: \\((0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0)\\)\n  - \\(d_1' = 2\\): \\(d_2 + d_3 = 2\\) \u2192 Solutions: \\((0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\\)\n  - \\(d_1' = 3\\): \\(d_2 + d_3 = 1\\) \u2192 Solutions: \\((0,1), (1,0)\\)\n  - \\(d_1' = 4\\): \\(d_2 + d_3 = 0\\) \u2192 Solution: \\((0,0)\\)\n\n- **Mapping Back:**\n  - Original \\(d_1 = d_1' + 1\\)\n  - List all \\((d_1, d_2, d_3)\\) tuples.\n\n- **Resulting Solutions:**\n  - \\((1,0,4)\\)\n  - \\((1,1,3)\\)\n  - \\((1,2,2)\\)\n  - \\((1,3,1)\\)\n  - \\((1,4,0)\\)\n  - \\((2,0,3)\\)\n  - \\((2,1,2)\\)\n  - \\((2,2,1)\\)\n  - \\((2,3,0)\\)\n  - \\((3,0,2)\\)\n  - \\((3,1,1)\\)\n  - \\((3,2,0)\\)\n  - \\((4,0,1)\\)\n  - \\((4,1,0)\\)\n  - \\((5,0,0)\\)\n\n- **Count:** There are \\(15\\) valid three-digit numbers.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Objective:** Ensure all listed numbers are three-digit integers and that their digits sum to \\(5\\).\n\n- **Reflection:** Let's take a few examples from the list and check:\n  - **Example 1:** \\((1,0,4)\\) \u2192 \\(1 + 0 + 4 = 5\\) \u2192 Valid three-digit number: \\(104\\)\n  - **Example 2:** \\((3,1,1)\\) \u2192 \\(3 + 1 + 1 = 5\\) \u2192 Valid three-digit number: \\(311\\)\n  - **Example 3:** \\((4,0,1)\\) \u2192 \\(4 + 0 + 1 = 5\\) \u2192 Valid three-digit number: \\(401\\)\n\n- **Check Across the List:** All entries follow the same pattern, ensuring they are valid three-digit numbers.\n\n- **Final Reflection:** The strategy seems correct, and the count aligns with the combinatorial solution.\n\n### **Step 5: Alternative Approach - Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Objective:** Verify the solution using a different method to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Consider counting all three-digit numbers and subtracting those whose digit sums do not equal \\(5\\). However, this seems more complex than necessary since our previous method is straightforward.\n\n- **Reflection:** Given the simplicity and correctness of the combinatorial approach, I think it's best to stick with it. However, exploring different strategies is always helpful to confirm the solution.\n\n**Check:** Does this alternative approach add value? Not really in this case, as the original method is already clear and correct.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, applying the combinatorial method, and verifying the solutions, **there are exactly \\(15\\) three-digit positive integers whose digits sum to \\(5\\)**. Here's the final list:\n\n1. \\(104\\)\n2. \\(113\\)\n3. \\(122\\)\n4. \\(131\\)\n5. \\(140\\)\n6. \\(203\\)\n7. \\(212\\)\n8. \\(221\\)\n9. \\(230\\)\n10. \\(302\\)\n11. \\(311\\)\n12. \\(320\\)\n13. \\(401\\)\n14. \\(410\\)\n15. \\(500\\)\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Reflection:** Initially, I considered listing all possibilities but shifted to a combinatorial approach for efficiency. Checking a few sample solutions confirmed the correctness.\n  \n- **Mistake Recognition:** At first, I didn't account for the maximum value \\(d_1\\) could take, but upon reflecting, I realized all solutions fit within the digit constraints.\n\n- **Lesson Learned:** It's essential to verify each step and be open to adjusting the approach if something seems off. Multiple strategies can confirm the correctness of a solution.\n\n- **Final Check:** Counting the listed numbers confirms the total is \\(15\\), matching our combinatorial calculation.\n\nBy thinking through each step, checking for correctness, and being willing to change direction, we've confidently arrived at the solution.",
