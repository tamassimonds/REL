    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work as I go to ensure correctness. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 - 7 = 4y - 14x + 3 \\]\n\nHonestly, my initial reaction is, \"This looks like the equation of a circle or maybe a conic section.\" I remember that equations involving \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\) often relate to circles or ellipses. But I also recall that rearranging terms might help clarify its geometric representation.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Option 1:** Try to rearrange the equation to see if it fits the standard form of a circle.\n- **Option 2:** Perhaps complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to simplify it.\n- **Option 3:** Check if moving all terms to one side makes it easier to identify the shape.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m leaning towards **Option 1**\u2014rearranging to see if it resembles a circle's equation. But if that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll consider completing the square.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Rearranging the Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s start by moving all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 - 7 - 4y + 14x - 3 = 0 \\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 + 14x - 4y - 7 - 3 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 + 14x - 4y - 10 = 0 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this still looks cluttered. It\u2019s not immediately obvious that it\u2019s a circle. Maybe completing the square could help tidy it up.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Completing the Square**\n\nI recall that completing the square is a technique to transform quadratic expressions into perfect squares, making it easier to identify the geometric shape.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **For \\(x\\) terms:** \\(x^2 + 14x\\)\n- **For \\(y\\) terms:** \\(y^2 - 4y\\)\n\nLet\u2019s tackle the \\(x\\) terms first.\n\n**Completing the Square for \\(x\\):**\n\n\\[ x^2 + 14x \\]\n\nTake half of the coefficient of \\(x\\), square it:\n\nHalf of 14 is 7, and \\(7^2 = 49\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ x^2 + 14x = (x + 7)^2 - 49 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, that seems to work. Let\u2019s do the same for the \\(y\\) terms.\n\n**Completing the Square for \\(y\\):**\n\n\\[ y^2 - 4y \\]\n\nHalf of -4 is -2, and \\((-2)^2 = 4\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ y^2 - 4y = (y - 2)^2 - 4 \\]\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\nSubstitute back into the equation:\n\n\\[ (x + 7)^2 - 49 + (y - 2)^2 - 4 - 10 = 0 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ (x + 7)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 49 - 4 - 10 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ (x + 7)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 63 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ (x + 7)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 63 \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait a moment, that looks like the standard form of a circle:\n\n\\[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \\]\n\nWhere \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius. Here:\n\n- Center \\((-7, 2)\\)\n- Radius \\(r = \\sqrt{63} = 3\\sqrt{7}\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis transformation makes sense. The equation now clearly represents a circle. So, I feel confident that completing the square was the right approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Area of the Circle**\n\nNow that I\u2019ve identified the circle, calculating the area should be straightforward.\n\n**Formula for Area of a Circle:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nGiven that \\(r = 3\\sqrt{7}\\), let's calculate:\n\n\\[ r^2 = (3\\sqrt{7})^2 = 9 \\times 7 = 63 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times 63 = 63\\pi \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify:\n\n- The radius squared is \\(63\\), multiplying by \\(\\pi\\) gives \\(63\\pi\\). That seems correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. By transforming the original equation into the standard form of a circle, I\u2019ve successfully identified the center and radius, allowing me to compute the area accurately.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy initially attempting to rearrange the equation, I realized it wasn\u2019t in a recognizable form. Completing the square was an effective strategy to convert it into the standard circle equation. This step-by-step approach, along with regular reflections and checks, ensured that I arrived at the correct area of the circle: **\\(63\\pi\\)**.\n\nThroughout the problem, being open to changing strategies and regularly verifying each step was crucial in maintaining accuracy and confidence in the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We rewrite the equation as $x^2 + 14x + y^2 - 4y = 10$ and then complete the square, resulting in  $(x+7)^2-49 + (y-2)^2-4=10$, or $(x+7)^2+(y-2)^2=63$. This is the equation of a circle with center $(-7, 2)$ and radius $\\sqrt{63},$ so the area of this region is $\\pi r^2 = \\boxed{63\\pi}$."
