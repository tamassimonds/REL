  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem as if we're working through it step by step, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each stage, and making sure everything checks out along the way. Our goal is to arrive at the final answer naturally, just as we would when solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the equation we're dealing with is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-n}{n+1} + \\frac{2n-4}{2-n} = 1\n\\]\n\nAt first glance, this looks like a rational equation with variables in the denominators. I remember dealing with similar problems before where simplifying the fractions or finding a common denominator helped. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure which method will work best here. Let's brainstorm some strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Simplify Each Fraction:**  \n   Maybe I can simplify the fractions individually first. The second fraction, \\(\\frac{2n-4}{2-n}\\), looks like it might reduce.\n\n2. **Find a Common Denominator:**  \n   Another option is to combine the fractions by finding a common denominator. This might help in eliminating the fractions altogether.\n\n3. **Cross-Multiplication:**  \n   Since it's an equation with fractions, cross-multiplying could potentially clear the denominators.\n\n4. **Substitution:**  \n   Perhaps substituting variables to simplify the expression might work, though it seems a bit overcomplicated for this problem.\n\nOut of these, simplifying each fraction seems like a straightforward place to start. Let's try that first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify \\(\\frac{2n-4}{2-n}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLooking at \\(\\frac{2n-4}{2-n}\\), I notice that the numerator can be factored. Let's see if that helps.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n2n - 4 = 2(n - 2)\n\\]\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2n-4}{2-n} = \\frac{2(n-2)}{2-n}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, I see that \\(2-n\\) is the negative of \\(n-2\\). This reminds me that I can factor out a negative sign.\n\n**Simplification:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{2(n-2)}{2-n} = \\frac{2(n-2)}{-(n-2)} = -2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me double-check that. Yup, \\(n-2\\) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving \\(-2\\).  \nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2n-4}{2-n} = -2\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis simplification definitely works. Now, the original equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-n}{n+1} - 2 = 1\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solve the Simplified Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-n}{n+1} - 2 = 1\n\\]\n\nI think adding 2 to both sides to isolate the fraction would be a good next step.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{2-n}{n+1} = 1 + 2 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThat seems correct. Moving the constant to the other side simplifies the equation nicely.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNow the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-n}{n+1} = 3\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Eliminate the Denominator by Cross-Multiplying**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo get rid of the fraction, I can cross-multiply. This should give me a straightforward linear equation.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n2-n = 3(n+1)\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nCross-multiplying seems logical here. Let's expand and see if it works.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nProceeding to expand both sides.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Expand and Simplify the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's distribute the 3 on the right side to simplify the equation.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n2 - n = 3n + 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nExpanding seems correct. Now I can move terms around to solve for \\(n\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTime to rearrange the equation to isolate \\(n\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solve for \\(n\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI'll bring all terms involving \\(n\\) to one side and constants to the other.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n2 - n - 3n = 3  \n2 - 4n = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nCombining like terms gives \\(-4n\\), which looks correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNow, I need to isolate \\(n\\) by moving the constant to the other side.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n2 - 4n = 3  \n-4n = 3 - 2  \n-4n = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives 1, so that's correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNow, solve for \\(n\\) by dividing both sides by \\(-4\\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\nn = \\frac{1}{-4} = -\\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nEverything checks out so far. But let's verify by substituting back into the original equation to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSubstituting \\(n = -\\frac{1}{4}\\) back into the original equation will confirm if our solution is correct.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nOriginal equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-n}{n+1} + \\frac{2n-4}{2-n} = 1\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(n = -\\frac{1}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}{-\\frac{1}{4} + 1} + \\frac{2\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) - 4}{2 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)} = 1\n\\]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 + \\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{4}}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 3\n\\]\n\nSecond fraction (already simplified earlier):\n\n\\[\n-2\n\\]\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n3 + (-2) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThe left side equals the right side (\\(1 = 1\\)), so our solution is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe solution \\(n = -\\frac{1}{4}\\) satisfies the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\\(n = -\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Considered simplifying fractions, finding a common denominator, cross-multiplying, and substitution. Started with simplifying the second fraction.\n  \n- **Simplification:** Factored and simplified \\(\\frac{2n-4}{2-n}\\) to \\(-2\\), reducing the original equation to \\(\\frac{2-n}{n+1} - 2 = 1\\).\n\n- **Solving the Equation:** Added 2 to both sides, resulting in \\(\\frac{2-n}{n+1} = 3\\).
