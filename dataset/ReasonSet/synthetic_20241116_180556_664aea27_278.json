    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, see which one fits, and adjust as needed. I'll reflect frequently to ensure I'm on the right track, checking my work along the way. Let's treat this like a real problem-solving session, complete with initial confusion, brainstorming, checking, and maybe even changing directions.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first glance at the equation \\(2^{2x} - 3^{2y} = 55\\), a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Exponents Involved:** Both sides involve exponents, which reminds me of properties of powers and maybe logarithms.\n   \n2. **Integer Solutions:** The problem specifically asks for integer solutions, so negative exponents and fractional exponents might be off the table.\n\n3. **Difference of Squares:** The left-hand side looks like a difference of squares, which could be a helpful insight.\n\n4. **Check Small Values:** Maybe testing small integer values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) could give a clue.\n\n5. **Modular Arithmetic:** Considering the equation modulo certain bases might help identify possible solutions or eliminate impossibilities.\n\nInitially, I'm leaning towards exploring the **difference of squares** idea or perhaps **testing small values**, but I'm open to other methods if these don't pan out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Difference of Squares**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The left side, \\(2^{2x} - 3^{2y}\\), resembles the **difference of squares** form: \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\).\n- If I can rewrite it this way, it might help factor the equation and solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) more easily.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet\u2019s try factoring \\(2^{2x} - 3^{2y}\\):\n\n\\[\n2^{2x} - 3^{2y} = (2^x)^2 - (3^y)^2 = (2^x - 3^y)(2^x + 3^y)\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(2^x - 3^y)(2^x + 3^y) = 55\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, this looks promising because 55 can be factored into pairs of integers. Let\u2019s see how we can set up these factorizations.\n\nPossible factor pairs of 55 are:\n\n\\[\n(1, 55), \\quad (5, 11), \\quad (-1, -55), \\quad (-5, -11)\n\\]\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI'll set each pair equal to \\((2^x - 3^y)\\) and \\((2^x + 3^y)\\) to form systems of equations. Let's see if this leads to integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up Systems of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Each factor pair can correspond to:\n  \\[\n  2^x - 3^y = \\text{smaller factor}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2^x + 3^y = \\text{larger factor}\n  \\]\n- By adding and subtracting these equations, I can isolate \\(2^x\\) and \\(3^y\\).\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet\u2019s take the positive factor pair \\((5, 11)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2^x - 3^y &= 5 \\quad \\text{(i)}\\\\\n2^x + 3^y &= 11 \\quad \\text{(ii)}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Adding Equations (i) and (ii):**\n\n\\[\n2(2^x) = 5 + 11 = 16 \\implies 2^x = 8 \\implies x = 3\n\\]\n\n**Subtracting Equation (i) from (ii):**\n\n\\[\n2(3^y) = 11 - 5 = 6 \\implies 3^y = 3 \\implies y = 1\n\\]\n\n**Solution Found:**\n\n\\((x, y) = (3, 1)\\)\n\n**Checking:**\n\nDoes this satisfy the original equation?\n\n\\[\n2^{2(3)} - 3^{2(1)} = 2^6 - 3^2 = 64 - 9 = 55 \\quad \\checkmark\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAwesome! This pair works. But we need to check if there are other factor pairs that also yield integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Negative Factor Pairs**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The original equation involves exponents, so negative bases (like \\(2^{-x}\\) or \\(3^{-y}\\)) might not yield integer solutions unless both exponents are negative, which could lead to non-integer solutions or complex numbers.\n- However, since the problem asks for integer solutions, maybe we should only consider non-negative integers for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet\u2019s look at the negative factor pair \\((-5, -11)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2^x - 3^y &= -5 \\quad \\text{(iii)}\\\\\n2^x + 3^y &= -11 \\quad \\text{(iv)}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Adding Equations (iii) and (iv):**\n\n\\[\n2(2^x) = -5 - 11 = -16 \\implies 2^x = -8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014\\(2^x\\) cannot be negative because \\(2^x\\) is always positive for real integers \\(x\\). This means there are no valid integer solutions from this pair.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNegative factor pairs don't yield valid integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Testing the Remaining Positive Factor Pair \\((1, 55)\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Maybe another positive factor pair could work. Let\u2019s try \\((1, 55)\\).\n\n**Attempt:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2^x - 3^y &= 1 \\quad \\text{(v)}\\\\\n2^x + 3^y &= 55 \\quad \\text{(vi)}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Adding Equations (v) and (vi):**\n\n\\[\n2(2^x) = 1 + 55 = 56 \\implies 2^x = 28 \\implies x = \\log_2(28)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUh-oh, \\(\\log_2(28)\\) is not an integer. This means \\(x\\) is not an integer here, so there are no integer solutions from this pair.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly the factor pair \\((5, 11)\\) yielded an integer solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s quickly review:\n\n- **Positive Factor Pair (5, 11):** Yielded \\(x = 3\\), \\(y = 1\\) \u21d2 Valid solution \\((3, 1)\\).\n- **Negative Factor Pair (-5, -11):** Led to negative \\(2^x\\), so no solution.\n- **Positive Factor Pair (1, 55):** Led to non-integer \\(x\\), so no solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOnly one integer solution \\((3, 1)\\) exists for the equation \\(2^{2x} - 3^{2y} = 55\\). This aligns with option **B) 1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Initially considered factoring using the difference of squares and testing small values.\n  \n- **Exploration:** Attempted to factor the equation into \\((2^x - 3^y)(2^x + 3^y) = 55\\) and set up systems using factor pairs.\n  \n- **Reflection:** Checked if solutions were valid integers; only one factor pair yielded a valid solution.\n  \n- **Checking:** Verified that the found solution satisfied the original equation.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** There is exactly one integer solution, so the answer is **1**.\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure to reflect and check each step to ensure the approach was correct, adjusting strategies as needed. This methodical approach led to identifying the single valid solution efficiently.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $a = 2^x$ and $b = 3^y$. Substituting these values results in\\[a^2 - b^2 = 55\\]Factor the difference of squares to get\\[(a + b)(a - b) = 55\\]If $y < 0$, then $55 + 3^{2y} < 64$, so $y$ can not be negative. If $x < 0$, then $2^{2x} < 1$. Since $3^{2y}$ is always positive, the result would be way less than $55$, so $x$ can not be negative. Thus, $x$ and $y$ have to be nonnegative, so $a$ and $b$ are integers. Thus,\\[a+b=55 \\text{ and } a-b=1\\]\\[\\text{or}\\]\\[a+b=11 \\text{ and } a-b=5\\]From the first case, $a = 28$ and $b = 27$. Since $2^x = 28$ does not have an integral solution, the first case does not work. From the second case, $a = 8$ and $b = 3$. Thus, $x = 3$ and $y = 1$. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ solution."
