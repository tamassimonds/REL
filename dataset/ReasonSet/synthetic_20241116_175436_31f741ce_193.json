    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, maybe hitting a dead end, and then adjusting my approach. \n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, the question asks how many positive whole numbers have cube roots less than 10. So, we're looking for numbers \\( n \\) where \\( \\sqrt[3]{n} < 10 \\).\n\nHmm, this reminds me of problems where you deal with exponents and inequalities. I know that cubing a number increases its value significantly\u2014like \\( 3^3 = 27 \\) and \\( 4^3 = 64 \\). But a cube root less than 10 means we're dealing with numbers that aren't too large.\n\n**Exploration:**\n- **Option 1:** Calculate \\( 10^3 = 1000 \\). So, theoretically, any number less than or equal to 1000 should work.\n- **Option 2:** List out cube roots of small numbers to see a pattern.\n- **Option 3:** Consider that negative numbers or non-integers don\u2019t apply since we\u2019re only looking at positive whole numbers.\n\nI think starting with \\( 10^3 \\) is straightforward, but maybe listing out some cube roots could help visualize it better.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- If I list cube roots of integers up to 10, I might see a pattern.\n- I could also think about whether there's a formula for the sum of cubes, but that seems unrelated here.\n\nLet me try calculating \\( 10^3 \\) and see where that leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating \\( 10^3 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAlright, I know that \\( 10^3 = 1000 \\). So, if \\( n \\leq 1000 \\), then \\( \\sqrt[3]{n} \\) is definitely less than 10.\n\nBut wait, does this include all positive whole numbers up to 1000? Should I check if there are any nuances?\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Does \\( n = 1000 \\) work?** \\( \\sqrt[3]{1000} = 10 \\), which is equal to 10, not less than 10. So, we need \\( n < 1000 \\).\n- **So, \\( n \\) should be between 1 and 999, inclusive.**\n\nFeeling good about this. But let me reflect if there\u2019s another way to double-check.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Alternative Approach\u2014Listing Cube Roots**\n\n**Exploration:**\nThinking about listing cube roots of integers to see how they grow.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Start with small numbers:**\n  - \\( \\sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \\)\n  - \\( \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2 \\)\n  - \\( \\sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \\)\n  - \\( \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \\)\n\n- **Notice the pattern:**\n  - Cube roots increase as the base number increases.\n  - By \\( n = 10 \\), \\( \\sqrt[3]{10} \\approx 2.15 \\). That\u2019s still much less than 10.\n\nHmm, this seems to confirm that even at \\( n = 10 \\), the cube root is far from 10. I don't see any issues here.\n\nBut let me consider whether I need to account for larger numbers differently.\n\n**Realization:**\n- **Since cubes grow rapidly,** even \\( n = 100 \\) gives \\( \\sqrt[3]{100} \\approx 4.64 \\), which is still much less than 10.\n- **Thus, it seems safe** to say that \\( n < 1000 \\) covers all bases.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis method reinforces the initial calculation. I\u2019m confident that \\( n \\) should be less than or equal to 1000.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finalizing the Range of \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBased on the calculations and alternative approach, the range for \\( n \\) is from 1 to 999.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Minimum \\( n \\):** \\( \\sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \\), which is less than 10.\n- **Maximum \\( n \\):** \\( \\sqrt[3]{999} \\approx 9.997 \\), still less than 10.\n\n**Feeling Confident:**\nSeems correct. All positive whole numbers up to 999 have cube roots less than 10.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Counting the Numbers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to find how many whole numbers are between 1 and 999 inclusive.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Total numbers = \\( 999 - 1 + 1 = 999 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, let me double-check the counting:\n\n- **From 1 to 999 inclusive:** That's 999 numbers.\n- **The addition of 1:** Correct, because both endpoints are included.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nYes, there are **999** positive whole numbers whose cube roots are less than 10.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Random Insight:**\nIs there a possibility of missing numbers by only considering up to 1000?\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Check \\( n = 1000 \\):** \\( \\sqrt[3]{1000} = 10 \\), which doesn\u2019t satisfy the condition \\( < 10 \\).\n- **Therefore, \\( n \\) must be up to 999.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **Does \\( n = 999 \\) work?** \\( \\sqrt[3]{999} \\approx 9.997 \\), which is less than 10.\n- **All numbers from 1 to 999 work:** As confirmed earlier.\n\n**Feeling Confident:**\nI\u2019m certain that the answer is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThere are **999** positive whole numbers whose cube roots are less than 10.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nBy exploring multiple strategies\u2014calculating \\( 10^3 \\), listing cube roots, and verifying the range\u2014I\u2019ve ensured the answer is accurate. Checking each step helped catch any potential miscalculations, and reflecting along the way confirmed the approach was sound. This methodical thinking led to a confident and correct solution.\n\nHope this helps! \ud83d\ude0a",
