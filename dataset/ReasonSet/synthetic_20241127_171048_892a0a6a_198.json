  "problem": "How many distinct prime factors does the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ have?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, embracing the natural thought process that comes with problem-solving. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### First Thoughts: Understanding the Question\n\nOkay, so the question is asking us to find how many distinct prime factors the sum of the positive divisors of \\(400\\) has.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving **divisors and prime factorization**. I recall that finding the sum of divisors might involve using the **sigma function** or something related to prime factors.\n  \n- **Brainstorming:** I'm thinking I need to:\n  1. **Find all positive divisors of \\(400\\).**\n  2. **Compute the sum of these divisors.**\n  3. **Determine the distinct prime factors of this sum.**\n\nBut wait, finding all divisors manually could be tedious. Maybe there's a formula to simplify this?\n\n---\n\n### Exploring Strategies: Prime Factorization\n\n- **Strategy Idea 1:** Use **prime factorization** to find the sum of divisors.\n\n- **Thought Process:** If I can express \\(400\\) in terms of its prime factors, I can use formulas to find the sum of its divisors without listing them all.\n\n- **Recalling a Formula:** I remember that for a number \\( n = p_1^{k_1} \\times p_2^{k_2} \\times \\ldots \\), the sum of its divisors is:\n  \\[\n  (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\ldots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + \\ldots + p_2^{k_2}) \\ldots\n  \\]\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, this seems like a more efficient approach than listing all divisors.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of \\(400\\)\n\n- **Calculating:** Let's break down \\(400\\) into its prime factors.\n\n  - \\(400\\) is even, so divide by \\(2\\):\n    \\[\n    400 \\div 2 = 200 \\\\\n    200 \\div 2 = 100 \\\\\n    100 \\div 2 = 50 \\\\\n    50 \\div 2 = 25 \\\\\n    25 \\div 5 = 5 \\\\\n    5 \\div 5 = 1\n    \\]\n    \n  - **Prime Factors:** \\(400 = 2^4 \\times 5^2\\)\n\n- **Reflection:** This factorization looks correct. Each step divides \\(400\\) by its smallest prime factors until reaching \\(1\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Sum of Divisors Formula\n\n- **Using the Formula:** Now, plug the prime factors into the sum of divisors formula:\n  \\[\n  \\sigma(400) = (1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)(1 + 5 + 5^2)\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating Each Term:**\n  - **First Parenthesis:**\n    \\[\n    1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31\n    \\]\n    \n  - **Second Parenthesis:**\n    \\[\n    1 + 5 + 25 = 31\n    \\]\n    \n- **Multiplying the Terms:**\n  \\[\n  31 \\times 31 = 961\n  \\]\n  \n- **Sum of Divisors:** So, \\(\\sigma(400) = 961\\)\n\n- **Quick Check:** Multiplying \\(31 \\times 31\\):\n  \\[\n  30 \\times 30 = 900 \\\\\n  30 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 30 = 60 \\\\\n  1 \\times 1 = 1 \\\\\n  Total = 900 + 60 + 1 = 961\n  \\]\n  \n  - **Check Passed:** The multiplication is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Distinct Prime Factors of \\(961\\)\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** Now, I need to find the prime factors of \\(961\\). This number looks familiar\u2014perhaps it's a perfect square?\n\n- **Exploration:** Let's see if \\(961\\) is a perfect square.\n\n- **Calculating Square Root:**\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{961} = 31\n  \\]\n  \n  - **Verification:** \n    \\[\n    31 \\times 31 = 961\n    \\]\n    \n  - **Reflection:** Yep, \\(961\\) is \\(31^2\\).\n\n- **Factoring \\(961\\):** Since \\(961 = 31^2\\), the only prime factor is \\(31\\).\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\(31\\) have any smaller prime factors?\n  - \\(31\\) is a prime number itself, so no smaller prime factors exist.\n\n---\n\n### Final Reflection: Is the Approach Correct?\n\n- **Reviewing Steps:**\n  1. **Prime Factorization of \\(400\\):** \u2714\ufe0f\n  2. **Sum of Divisors Using Formula:** \u2714\ufe0f\n  3. **Prime Factorization of \\(961\\):** \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?** \n  - Only one distinct prime factor (\\(31\\)) was found in the sum of the divisors.\n  - This aligns with the calculations.\n\n- **Final Check:** All steps logically follow each other, and no errors were detected during the process.\n\n---\n\n### Answer\n\n**<ANSWER> 1 distinct prime factor: 31 </ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy systematically breaking down the problem\u2014starting with prime factorization, applying the sum of divisors formula, and then factoring the resulting sum\u2014we determined that the sum of the positive divisors of \\(400\\) has **only one distinct prime factor: \\(31\\)**. Throughout the process, frequent checks ensured the correctness of each step, leading to a confident and accurate solution.",
  "ground_truth": "First, we find what the sum of the divisors of $400$ is.\n\nThe prime factorization of $400$ is $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, the sum of the divisors is $(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+5+5^2) = 31 \\cdot 31$. To see why the expression on the left-hand side gives the sum of the divisors of 400, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 15 terms, each divisor of $2^4\\cdot 5^2$ appearing exactly once.\n\nSince $31$ is a prime number, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ only has $\\boxed{1}$ prime factor."
