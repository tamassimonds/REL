  "problem": "Susie Q has 1000 dollars to invest.  She invests some of the money at the Pretty Penny Bank, which compounds annually at 3 percent.  She invests the rest of the money at the Five and Dime Bank, which compounds annually at 5 percent.  After two years, Susie has a total of $\\$1090.02$.  How much did Susie Q originally invest at the Pretty Penny Bank, in dollars?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like how I'd approach it if I were solving it on paper. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, it seems like a typical investment problem involving compound interest at two different rates. Susie invested part of her money at 3% and the rest at 5%, and after two years, her total amount grew to \\$1090.02. I need to find out how much she originally invested at the 3% rate.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n1. **Set Up Equations:** Maybe I can set up equations based on compound interest for both investments.\n   \n2. **Use Variables:** I\u2019ll probably need to assign variables to the amounts invested in each bank.\n   \n3. **Total Investment:** I know the total investment is \\$1000, so that could be helpful.\n\n4. **Check for Other Methods:** Perhaps using proportional reasoning or graphical methods, but equations seem straightforward.\n\nI'm leaning towards setting up equations because it aligns with similar problems I've encountered before.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Defining Variables**\n\nTo make things clear:\n\n- Let\u2019s say \\( x \\) is the amount invested at the Pretty Penny Bank (3%).\n- Therefore, \\( 1000 - x \\) would be the amount invested at the Five and Dime Bank (5%).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because the total invested is \\$1000, so whatever isn't invested at one bank must be invested at the other.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Compound Interest Formula**\n\nNow, I need to apply the compound interest formula to both investments. The formula is:\n\n\\[\nA = P(1 + r)^n\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount after \\( n \\) years,\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount,\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate,\n- \\( n \\) is the number of years.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFor the Pretty Penny Bank (3%):\n\n\\[\nA_1 = x(1 + 0.03)^2\n\\]\n\nFor the Five and Dime Bank (5%):\n\n\\[\nA_2 = (1000 - x)(1 + 0.05)^2\n\\]\n\nAfter two years, the total amount is the sum of both:\n\n\\[\nA_1 + A_2 = 1090.02\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n\\[\nx(1.03)^2 + (1000 - x)(1.05)^2 = 1090.02\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nWait, let me compute \\(1.03^2\\) and \\(1.05^2\\) to simplify the equation.\n\n\\[\n1.03^2 = 1.0609\n\\]\n\\[\n1.05^2 = 1.1025\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n1.0609x + 1.1025(1000 - x) = 1090.02\n\\]\n\nLooks good so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nLet's expand and simplify the equation.\n\n\\[\n1.0609x + 1102.5 - 1.1025x = 1090.02\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[\n(1.0609 - 1.1025)x + 1102.5 = 1090.02\n\\]\n\\[\n-0.0416x + 1102.5 = 1090.02\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIs this correct? Let me double-check the subtraction:\n\n\\[\n1.0609 - 1.1025 = -0.0416\n\\]\n\nYes, that's accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving for \\( x \\)**\n\nNow, let's isolate \\( x \\) to find the amount invested at the Pretty Penny Bank.\n\nFirst, subtract 1102.5 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-0.0416x = 1090.02 - 1102.5\n\\]\n\\[\n-0.0416x = -12.48\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by -0.0416 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-12.48}{-0.0416} = 300\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes this value make sense? If \\( x = 300 \\), then \\$300 was invested at the Pretty Penny Bank.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\nIt's always a good idea to verify the solution to ensure it's correct.\n\n**Calculate Amounts After Two Years:**\n\n1. **Pretty Penny Bank (3%):**\n\n\\[\nA_1 = 300(1.03)^2 = 300 \\times 1.0609 = 318.27\n\\]\n\n2. **Five and Dime Bank (5%):**\n\n\\[\nA_2 = 700(1.05)^2 = 700 \\times 1.1025 = 771.75\n\\]\n\n**Total After Two Years:**\n\n\\[\nA_1 + A_2 = 318.27 + 771.75 = 1090.02\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe total matches the given amount in the problem (\\$1090.02), so the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach**\n\nJust to be thorough, let's briefly consider if there's another method to solve this, like using proportional reasoning or setting up a system of equations differently. However, the equation method worked smoothly, so an alternative isn't necessary but is always good to explore.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER> Susie Q originally invested \\$300 at the Pretty Penny Bank. </ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy setting up and solving the compound interest equations step by step, and verifying the solution, we determined that Susie Q invested \\$300 at the Pretty Penny Bank. Always remember to define variables clearly, simplify equations carefully, and check your work to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\nThere we go! By thinking it through like a human would\u2014brainstorming, checking along the way, and verifying the final answer\u2014we've successfully solved the problem.",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of dollars Susie Q invested at the Pretty Penny Bank.  Then she invested $1000 - x$ at the Five and Dime Bank.  After two years, her account at the Pretty Penny Bank has grown to $x \\cdot 1.03^2$, and her account at the Five and Dime Bank has grown to $(1000 - x) \\cdot 1.05^2$.  Therefore, \\[x \\cdot 1.03^2 + (1000 - x) \\cdot 1.05^2 = 1090.02.\\]We see that $x \\cdot 1.03^2 + (1000 - x) \\cdot 1.05^2 = 1.0609x + 1102.5 - 1.1025x = 1102.5 - 0.0416x$, so \\[1102.5 - 0.0416x = 1090.02.\\]Then \\[x = \\frac{1102.5 - 1090.02}{0.0416} = \\boxed{300}.\\]"
