  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's craft a complete, coherent solution by combining all the steps while maintaining the original thought process. We'll ensure each part flows naturally, reflecting genuine problem-solving strategies. Let's begin.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, we're tasked with transforming a parabola multiple times and then finding the zeros of the resulting parabola. My initial reaction is to think about coordinate geometry transformations\u2014specifically rotations and shifts. However, I'm a bit unsure how a 180-degree rotation around the vertex affects the parabola's equation. To tackle this, I'll brainstorm different strategies and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Understanding the Original Parabola:**  \n   - The given equation is \\( y = (x-2)^2 + 3 \\).  \n   - **Thought:** This is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at \\((2, 3)\\).  \n   - **Reflection:** Knowing the vertex is crucial since transformations are centered around it.\n\n2. **Applying a 180-Degree Rotation:**  \n   - **First Idea:** Rotating 180 degrees about the vertex might flip the parabola upside down.  \n   - **Uncertainty:** But does it change the orientation along both axes? I need to think more about how rotations affect parabolas.\n\n3. **Shifting the Parabola:**  \n   - **Next Steps:** After rotation, shift 3 units left and 2 units down.  \n   - **Thought:** This seems straightforward\u2014basic translation of the graph.\n\n4. **Finding the Zeros:**  \n   - **Final Goal:** Determine where the resulting parabola crosses the x-axis, i.e., find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( x = a \\) and \\( x = b \\).  \n   - **Check:** Adding \\( a + b \\) to get the final answer.\n\n**Initial Approach:**  \nI'll handle each transformation step-by-step\u2014first rotate, then shift, and finally find the zeros.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Original Parabola**\n\nLet's start with the original equation:\n\n\\[ y = (x-2)^2 + 3 \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**  \n- This is in vertex form \\( y = (x-h)^2 + k \\), so the vertex is at \\((h, k) = (2, 3)\\).\n- The parabola opens upwards since the coefficient of \\((x-2)^2\\) is positive.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nKnowing the vertex and orientation is essential before applying transformations. No issues here, so let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying a 180-Degree Rotation About the Vertex**\n\n**Idea:**  \nRotating the parabola 180 degrees around its vertex should flip it upside down.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Wait a minute:** A 180-degree rotation around the vertex should make the parabola open downwards.\n- **Check:** Does this mean the equation changes? I think the coefficient of the squared term should become negative.\n\n**Approach:**  \nI'll modify the equation to reflect this rotation.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ y = -((x-2)^2) + 3 \\]\n\n**Simplification:**  \n\\[ y = -(x-2)^2 + 3 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because changing the sign in front of \\((x-2)^2\\) flips the parabola to open downwards.\n- **Brainstorming Again:** Is there anything else that changes? No, the vertex remains the same since the rotation is about the vertex.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe rotated parabola's equation is \\( y = -(x-2)^2 + 3 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Shifting the Parabola 3 Units to the Left**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nShifting left affects the x-term inside the squared expression.\n\n**Strategy:**  \nReplace \\( x \\) with \\( x + 3 \\) to shift the parabola left by 3 units.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nStarting with the rotated equation:\n\n\\[ y = -((x+3)-2)^2 + 3 \\]\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ y = -(x+1)^2 + 3 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:** Shifting left by 3 means adjusting the \\( x \\) term by adding 3. The equation looks correct.\n- **Is This Right?:** Yes, because replacing \\( x \\) with \\( x + 3 \\) appropriately shifts the graph to the left.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAfter the left shift, the equation becomes \\( y = -(x+1)^2 + 3 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Shifting the Parabola 2 Units Down**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nShifting down affects the constant term \\( k \\) in the equation.\n\n**Strategy:**  \nSubtract 2 from the entire equation to move the parabola down.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nStarting with the equation after the left shift:\n\n\\[ y = -(x+1)^2 + 3 - 2 \\]\n\nSimplify the constant term:\n\n\\[ y = -(x+1)^2 + 1 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:** Subtracting 2 from the constant term lowers the entire parabola by 2 units. This seems correct.\n- **Brainstorm Alternate Checks:** Maybe sketching a rough graph to visualize the transformations? But numerically, it looks fine.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAfter shifting down, the final equation is \\( y = -(x+1)^2 + 1 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Zeros of the Final Parabola**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThe zeros of the parabola occur where \\( y = 0 \\).\n\n**Strategy:**  \nSet the equation to zero and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \nSet \\( y = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 0 = -(x+1)^2 + 1 \\]\n\nMove the constant to the other side:\n\n\\[ -(x+1)^2 = -1 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by -1:\n\n\\[ (x+1)^2 = 1 \\]\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ x + 1 = \\pm 1 \\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x \\):**  \n- When \\( x + 1 = 1 \\):  \n  \\[ x = 0 \\]\n- When \\( x + 1 = -1 \\):  \n  \\[ x = -2 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because solving the quadratic equation yields two real roots.\n- **Does This Fit with Transformations?:** The zeros are at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\), which aligns with the shifts applied.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe zeros are \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating \\( a + b \\)**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nGiven zeros at \\( x = a \\) and \\( x = b \\), we need to find \\( a + b = 0 + (-2) \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ a + b = 0 + (-2) = -2 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Final Check:** Adding the zeros yields \\(-2\\), which seems consistent with the previous steps.\n- **Does This Answer the Question?:** Yes, we've found \\( a + b \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe value of \\( a + b \\) is \\(-2\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(-2\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Checking the Approach**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Thinking about rotations and shifts led me to carefully apply each transformation step by step.\n- **Checking Each Step:** After each transformation, I verified whether the changes made sense, both algebraically and conceptually.\n- **Adjusting Strategies:** Initially unsure about the rotation, but by reflecting and checking, it became clear that flipping the parabola required changing the sign of the squared term.\n- **Final Verification:** Solving for the zeros and calculating \\( a + b \\) matched the expected outcome, confirming the correctness of the approach.\n\n**Overall Reflection:**  \nApproaching the problem methodically by breaking it down into individual transformations ensured accuracy. Regular checks after each step helped catch any potential errors early, leading to a correct and confident solution.\n\n---\n\nAnd there we have it\u2014a complete, coherent solution that maintains the original thought process while ensuring clarity and correctness at each step.

  "ground_truth": "The graph of the original parabola ($A$) and its final image ($A'$) after rotation and translation is shown below:\n\n[asy]\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(-3,4,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nyaxis(-3,7,Ticks(f, 2.0));\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn (x-2)^2+3;\n\n}\n\ndraw(\"$A$\", graph(f,0,4), linewidth(1));\nreal g(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn -(x+1)^2+1;\n\n}\n\ndraw(\"$A'$\", graph(g,-3,1), linewidth(1));\n[/asy]\n\nRotating the original parabola 180 degrees changes its equation to $y=-(x-2)^2+3$. Shifting this last parabola to the left changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+3$. Shifting it down changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+1$. So the equation of $A'$ is $y=-(x+1)^2+1$. To find the zeros of this parabola, we set $y=0$ to get $0=-(x+1)^2+1$. Expanding the right hand side gives $0=-x^2-2x$. Dividing through by $-1$ and factoring out an $x$ from the right hand side, we get $0=x(x+2)$, so either $x=0$ or $x+2=0$. Thus, $a=0$ and $b=-2$, so $a+b=\\boxed{-2}$."
