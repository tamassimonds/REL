  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, keeping the original thought process intact but streamlining it into a coherent solution. I'll walk through each stage naturally, reflecting and checking along the way, just as I would if I were solving it on paper. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to express \\(4.\\overline{054}\\) as a common fraction in its lowest terms.\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nOkay, this is a repeating decimal problem with \"054\" repeating indefinitely. I recall that converting repeating decimals to fractions can be done using the **algebraic method**, which involves setting up equations to eliminate the repeating part. Let's dive into it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Assign the Repeating Decimal to a Variable**\n\n**Action:**  \nLet's start by assigning the repeating decimal to a variable:\n\n\\[ \nx = 4.\\overline{054} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy doing this, I can manipulate the equation to get rid of the repeating part. This seems like a solid first step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Create a Second Equation to Eliminate the Repeating Part**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nTo eliminate the repeating decimal, I need to shift the decimal point to the right so that the repeating part aligns. Since \"054\" has three digits, I'll multiply both sides of the equation by \\(10^3 = 1000\\).\n\n**Action:**  \n\n\\[ \n1000x = 4054.\\overline{054} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, multiplying by 1000 shifts the decimal three places to the right, aligning the repeating part. Looks good!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Subtract the Original Equation from the New Equation**\n\n**Action:**  \nNow, subtract the original equation from the new one to eliminate the repeating part:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1000x & = 4054.\\overline{054} \\\\\n- \\quad \\,\\, x & = \\quad\\ \\,\\,4.\\overline{054} \\\\\n\\hline\n999x & = 4050 \n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute... Let's double-check the subtraction:\n\n\\[\n4054.\\overline{054} - 4.\\overline{054} = 4050 \n\\]\n\nYup, that\u2019s correct! So, \\(999x = 4050\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solve for \\(x\\)**\n\n**Action:**  \nNow, solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 999:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4050}{999} \n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nAlright, I've got a fraction, but it's not in its lowest terms yet. I need to simplify it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Simplify the Fraction**\n\n**Idea:**  \nTo simplify \\(\\frac{4050}{999}\\), I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4050 and 999 and divide both the numerator and denominator by it.\n\n**Action:**  \nLet's factor both numbers to find their GCD.\n\n- **Factoring 4050:**\n  - 4050 is even, so divide by 2:\n    \n    \\[ 4050 \u00f7 2 = 2025 \\]\n    \n  - 2025 ends in 5, divisible by 5:\n    \n    \\[ 2025 \u00f7 5 = 405 \\]\n    \n  - 405 ends in 5, divisible by 5:\n    \n    \\[ 405 \u00f7 5 = 81 \\]\n    \n  - 81 is \\(9 \u00d7 9\\), and 9 is \\(3 \u00d7 3\\).\n    \n  So, \n\n  \\[\n  4050 = 2 \u00d7 5^2 \u00d7 3^4 \n  \\]\n\n- **Factoring 999:**\n  - 999 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 27):\n    \n    \\[ 999 \u00f7 3 = 333 \\]\n    \n  - 333 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 9):\n    \n    \\[ 333 \u00f7 3 = 111 \\]\n    \n  - 111 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 3):\n    \n    \\[ 111 \u00f7 3 = 37 \\]\n    \n  - 37 is a prime number.\n    \n  So, \n\n  \\[\n  999 = 3^3 \u00d7 37 \n  \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this factoring look correct? Yes, breaking down both numbers step by step confirms their prime factors.\n\n**GCD Calculation:**  \nThe common factors are \\(3^3 = 27\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIt's always good to double-check GCD calculations to ensure accuracy. Since both numbers share \\(3^3\\), the GCD is 27.\n\n**Action:**  \nNow, divide both the numerator and denominator by their GCD:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4050 \u00f7 27}{999 \u00f7 27} = \\frac{150}{37} \n\\]\n\n**Calculation Check:**  \n- \\(4050 \u00f7 27 = 150\\)\n  \n- \\(999 \u00f7 27 = 37\\)\n  \nYup, that simplifies correctly to \\(\\frac{150}{37}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verify the Simplified Fraction**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nBefore finalizing the answer, it's crucial to verify that \\(\\frac{150}{37}\\) is in its lowest terms and accurately represents the original decimal.\n\n**Action:**  \n- **Check for Further Simplification:**  \n  - 37 is a prime number, and 150 is not divisible by 37, so the fraction is in its lowest terms.\n    \n- **Converting Back to Decimal:**  \n  - To ensure correctness, convert \\(\\frac{150}{37}\\) back to a decimal:\n    \n    \\[\n    150 \u00f7 37 = 4.054054054\\ldots\n    \\]\n    \n    Which matches \\(4.\\overline{054}\\).\n    \n**Reflection:**  \nThis confirms that the fraction is correct. Converting back to the decimal helps verify that no mistakes were made during simplification.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAfter breaking down the problem, applying the algebraic method, simplifying the fraction, and verifying the result, I can confidently state the final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{150}{37}}\n\\]\n\n<ANSWER>\\(4.\\overline{054} = \\frac{150}{37}\\) in its lowest terms.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy following a step-by-step approach, checking each part of the process, and verifying the final result, I ensured the solution's accuracy.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Understanding the Problem:**  \n  Recognizing the repeating decimal and recalling relevant methods was crucial.\n  \n- **Brainstorming and Selecting a Strategy:**  \n  Considering multiple approaches and choosing the most straightforward one helped streamline the solution.\n  \n- **Verification:**  \n  Consistently checking each step and verifying the final answer ensured correctness.\n  \nBy emulating a natural thought process, complete with reflections and checks, I effectively solved the problem, minimizing the chances of errors.\n\n---\n\nAnd there you have it! We've successfully converted \\(4.\\overline{054}\\) into its simplest fractional form, \\(\\frac{150}{37}\\), by carefully applying the algebraic method and verifying each step along the way.",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x = 4.\\overline{054}$.  We then have $1000x = 4054.\\overline{054}$, so $$ 1000x - x = 4054.\\overline{054} - 4.\\overline{054} = 4050 \\ \\ \\Rightarrow \\ \\ x = \\frac{4050}{999} = \\boxed{\\frac{150}{37}}. $$"
