    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem about the baseball league. I'll brainstorm and explore different strategies, check my work often, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving this on paper. Let\u2019s start by really understanding the question and reflecting on my initial thoughts.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- There are **nine teams** in the league.\n- Each team plays **exactly three games** with **each of the other teams**.\n- I need to find the **total number of games played**.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nWhen I first look at it, I think about:\n- How many teams are there?\n- How many games does each team play against each other?\n- Do I need to consider home and away games separately, or are they already included?\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI realize that \"three games with each of the other teams\" probably means that each team plays three games against every other team, so I don't need to differentiate between home and away. That simplifies things.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Pairwise Calculation**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Perhaps I can calculate the number of unique team pairings and multiply by the number of games each pairing has.\n  \n- **Formula Idea:** Total Games = Number of Unique Pairs \u00d7 Games per Pair\n\n**Strategy 2: Total Games per Team**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Alternatively, calculate the total number of games played by each team and ensure all games are counted only once.\n  \n- **Formula Idea:** Total Games = (Number of Teams \u00d7 Games per Team) / 2 (to avoid double counting)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth strategies seem viable. The first one ensures each unique matchup is counted the correct number of times, while the second one calculates based on each team\u2019s schedule, compensating for double counting. \n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nThinking back, the second strategy is generally simpler for these types of problems. Let's go with that and see if it leads to a correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Total Games per Team Strategy**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Number of Teams (N):** 9\n2. **Games per Team:** Each team plays 3 games against each of the other 8 teams.\n   \n   - Total games per team = 3 \u00d7 (N - 1) = 3 \u00d7 8 = **24**\n\n3. **Total Games Accounting for Double Counting:**\n\n   Since each game involves two teams, counting this way doubles the actual number of games. Therefore, divide by 2.\n\n   - Total unique games = (Total games per team \u00d7 Number of teams) / 2\n   - Total unique games = (24 \u00d7 9) / 2 = **108**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat number feels reasonable. Let me pause and check if this makes sense:\n\n- Each team plays 24 games.\n- With 9 teams, that sums up to 216 games, but since each game involves two teams, dividing by 2 gives 108.\n\nThis checks out because dividing by 2 corrects for counting each game twice (once for each team).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with the Pairwise Calculation Strategy**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Number of Unique Pairs:**\n\n   - Total unique pairs = N \u00d7 (N - 1) / 2\n   - Total unique pairs = 9 \u00d7 8 / 2 = **36**\n\n2. **Total Games:**\n\n   - Since each pair plays 3 games:\n   - Total games = Number of unique pairs \u00d7 Games per pair = 36 \u00d7 3 = **108**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth strategies lead to the same total number of games: **108**. This consistency gives me confidence that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Checking the Work**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does the number make sense?** 108 games in total for a league with 9 teams each playing multiple matchups seems reasonable.\n\n- **Are all teams accounted for?** Yes, each team plays games against all other teams.\n\n- **Is double counting corrected?** Yes, both strategies account for it.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nEverything checks out. The approach is coherent, and the calculations align with the problem\u2019s requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying calculations, the total number of games played in the league is **108**. By brainstorming, reflecting, and checking my work throughout the process, I ensured the solution is accurate and reliable.",

  "ground_truth": "Suppose each team played just one game with each of the remaining teams. Then each of the nine teams plays eight games. This makes a total of $9 \\times 8$ or 72 games. However each game has been counted twice in this total. For example, the game between Team A and Team B appears in A's 8 games and also B's 8 games. Therefore there are $9 \\times \\frac{8}{2} = 36$ different games played. Since each game is played three times, the total number of games played is $3 \\times 36 = \\boxed{108}$."
