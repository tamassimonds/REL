I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it manually. Let's brainstorm and reflect along the way to ensure we're on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, a few things come to mind:\n\n- **Understanding \"Cool\" Rectangles:** A rectangle is described as \"cool\" if its **area** is twice its **perimeter**, and both dimensions must be integers.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Algebraic Approach:** Set up an equation based on the definition.\n  - **Trial and Error:** Plug in different integer values for side lengths to see which satisfy the condition.\n  - **Factoring or Patterns:** Look for patterns or relationships between area and perimeter to find a general solution.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a problem involving relationships between area and perimeter, which reminds me of similar problems where you set up equations to find missing dimensions.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure which strategy will be the most efficient right off the bat. Let's explore them to see what works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting an Algebraic Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start by defining the variables:\n\n- Let \\( l \\) be the length of the rectangle.\n- Let \\( w \\) be the width of the rectangle.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n- **Area \\( A = l \\times w \\)**\n- **Perimeter \\( P = 2(l + w) \\)**\n\nThe cool condition is:\n\\[ A = 2P \\]\n\\[ l \\times w = 2 \\times 2(l + w) \\]\n\\[ l \\times w = 4(l + w) \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis simplifies the relationship between \\( l \\) and \\( w \\). But let's see if we can rearrange it to find a more direct solution.\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n\\[ lw = 4(l + w) \\]\n\\[ lw = 4l + 4w \\]\n\nSubtract both sides by \\( 4l + 4w \\):\n\\[ lw - 4l - 4w = 0 \\]\n\n**Organizing the Equation:**\n\\[ lw - 4l - 4w = 0 \\]\n\\[ l(w - 4) - 4w = 0 \\]\n\\[ l(w - 4) = 4w \\]\n\\[ l = \\frac{4w}{w - 4} \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis equation gives us \\( l \\) in terms of \\( w \\). But since both \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) must be integers, \\( \\frac{4w}{w - 4} \\) needs to simplify to an integer value.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nMaybe we can find integer values of \\( w \\) that make \\( l \\) also an integer. Let's test a few values to see if this works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Testing Integer Values for Width \\( w \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFrom the equation \\( l = \\frac{4w}{w - 4} \\), we can try different integer values for \\( w \\) to see if \\( l \\) also becomes an integer.\n\n**Testing \\( w = 5 \\):**\n\\[ l = \\frac{4(5)}{5 - 4} = \\frac{20}{1} = 20 \\]\n- **Length \\( l = 20 \\), Width \\( w = 5 \\)**\n- **Area \\( A = 20 \\times 5 = 100 \\)**\n- **Perimeter \\( P = 2(20 + 5) = 50 \\)**\n- **Check: \\( A = 2P \\Rightarrow 100 = 2 \\times 50 \\) \u2713**\n\n**This works!**\n\n**Testing \\( w = 6 \\):**\n\\[ l = \\frac{4(6)}{6 - 4} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\]\n- **Length \\( l = 12 \\), Width \\( w = 6 \\)**\n- **Area \\( A = 12 \\times 6 = 72 \\)**\n- **Perimeter \\( P = 2(12 + 6) = 36 \\)**\n- **Check: \\( A = 2P \\Rightarrow 72 = 2 \\times 36 \\) \u2713**\n\n**Testing \\( w = 8 \\):**\n\\[ l = \\frac{4(8)}{8 - 4} = \\frac{32}{4} = 8 \\]\n- **Length \\( l = 8 \\), Width \\( w = 8 \\)**\n- **Area \\( A = 8 \\times 8 = 64 \\)**\n- **Perimeter \\( P = 2(8 + 8) = 32 \\)**\n- **Check: \\( A = 2P \\Rightarrow 64 = 2 \\times 32 \\) \u2713**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo far, \\( w = 5, 6, \\) and \\( 8 \\) all lead to integer values for \\( l \\) and satisfy the cool condition. But what happens with \\( w = 7 \\)?\n\n**Testing \\( w = 7 \\):**\n\\[ l = \\frac{4(7)}{7 - 4} = \\frac{28}{3} \\]\n- **Length \\( l = \\frac{28}{3} \\) \u2248 9.33**\n\n**Check:**\n\nSince \\( l \\) is not an integer here, \\( w = 7 \\) doesn't work. This suggests that not all integer values of \\( w \\) will yield integer \\( l \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nPerhaps the value of \\( w \\) needs to be a multiple of 4 for \\( l \\) to be an integer? Let's test \\( w = 4 \\) to see if it holds.\n\n**Testing \\( w = 4 \\):**\n\\[ l = \\frac{4(4)}{4 - 4} = \\frac{16}{0} \\]\n- **Wait, division by zero!**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is undefined, which makes sense because \\( w = 4 \\) would lead to zero in the denominator. So, \\( w = 4 \\) doesn't work.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying a Pattern**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFrom the successful tests, it seems that \\( w \\) needs to be greater than 4 and not equal to 7. Let's see if there's a pattern:\n\n- **Successful \\( w \\):** 5, 6, 8\n- **Failed \\( w \\):** 7, 4 (division by zero)\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nMaybe \\( w \\) should be greater than 4 and not a multiple of 4? Let's explore this idea.\n\n**Testing \\( w = 10 \\):**\n\\[ l = \\frac{4(10)}{10 - 4} = \\frac{40}{6} = \\frac{20}{3} \\]\n- **Length \\( l = \\frac{20}{3} \\) \u2248 6.67**\n\n**Check:**\n\nAgain, \\( l \\) is not an integer, so \\( w = 10 \\) doesn't work.\n\n**Thinking Again:**\n\nIt seems that \\( w \\) being greater than 4 isn't enough; it also needs to be such that \\( w - 4 \\) divides \\( 4w \\) evenly to ensure \\( l \\) is an integer.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nMaybe I can factor the equation differently to find a more general solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Factoring the Original Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nRecall the original equation:\n\\[ lw = 4l + 4w \\]\n\\[ lw - 4l - 4w = 0 \\]\n\\[ l(w - 4) - 4w = 0 \\]\n\\[ l(w - 4) = 4w \\]\n\\[ l = \\frac{4w}{w - 4} \\]\n\nTo ensure \\( l \\) is an integer, \\( \\frac{4w}{w - 4} \\) must simplify to an integer. This suggests that \\( w - 4 \\) should be a divisor of \\( 4w \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nIf \\( w - 4 \\) divides \\( 4w \\), then perhaps \\( w - 4 \\) is a factor of \\( 16 \\) (since \\( 4w \\div (w - 4) = 4 + \\frac{16}{w - 4} \\)), which would mean that \\( w - 4 \\) must be a divisor of 16.\n\n**Thinking Through It:**\n\nWait, does this make sense? If \\( w - 4 \\) is a divisor of 16, then \\( w \\) can take specific values that make \\( l \\) an integer.\n\n**Exploring This Idea:**\n\nLet's list the divisors of 16:\n\\[ \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm 16 \\]\n\nSince \\( w - 4 \\) must be one of these, we can solve for \\( w \\):\n\\[ w - 4 = d \\Rightarrow w = d + 4 \\]\n\n**Valid Divisors:**\n\n- Positive divisors greater than 4:\n  - \\( 1 \\Rightarrow w = 5 \\)\n  - \\( 2 \\Rightarrow w = 6 \\)\n  - \\( 4 \\Rightarrow w = 8 \\)\n  - \\( 8 \\Rightarrow w = 12 \\)\n  - \\( 16 \\Rightarrow w = 20 \\)\n\n- Negative divisors:\n  - Not applicable since \\( w \\) must be positive.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis gives us potential values of \\( w \\): 5, 6, 8, 12, and 20. Let's check if these yield integer values for \\( l \\) and satisfy the cool condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Identified \\( w \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's test each identified \\( w \\) value to ensure \\( l \\) is an integer and the cool condition holds.\n\n**Testing \\( w = 5 \\):**\n\\[ l = \\frac{4(5)}{5 - 4} = \\frac{20}{1} = 20 \\]\n- **Area \\( A = 100 \\), Perimeter \\( P = 50 \\), A = 2P \u2713**\n\n**Testing \\( w = 6 \\):**\n\\[ l = \\frac{4(6)}{6 - 4} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\]\n- **Area \\( A = 72 \\), Perimeter \\( P = 36 \\), A = 2P \u2713**\n\n**Testing \\( w = 8 \\):**\n\\[ l = \\frac{4(8)}{8 - 4} = \\frac{32}{4} = 8 \\]\n- **Area \\( A = 64 \\), Perimeter \\( P = 32 \\), A = 2P \u2713**\n\n**Testing \\( w = 12 \\):**\n\\[ l = \\frac{4(12)}{12 - 4} = \\frac{48}{8} = 6 \\]\n- **Area \\( A = 72 \\), Perimeter \\( P = 36 \\), A = 2P \u2713**\n\n**Testing \\( w = 20 \\):**\n\\[ l = \\frac{4(20)}{20 - 4} = \\frac{80}{16} = 5 \\]\n- **Area \\( A = 100 \\), Perimeter \\( P = 50 \\), A = 2P \u2713**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAll these \\( w \\) values lead to integer \\( l \\) values, and the cool condition is satisfied. This seems to confirm that our earlier observation was correct.\n\n**Wait, But Have We Missed Something?**\n\nLooking back, the only \\( w \\) value we initially tested that didn't work was 7. But according to our factoring approach, \\( w = 7 + 4 = 11 \\) should also work since \\( 11 - 4 = 7 \\) divides \\( 4 \\times 11 = 44 \\) evenly.\n\n**Rechecking \\( w = 11 \\):**\n\\[ l = \\frac{4(11)}{11 - 4} = \\frac{44}{7} \\]\n- **Length \\( l = \\frac{44}{7} \\) \u2248 6.29**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHere, \\( l \\) is not an integer, which aligns with our initial test where \\( w = 7 \\) didn't work. It seems that not all values derived from the divisor approach work, possibly due to the specific condition of the cool rectangles.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nPerhaps there's a misstep in the factoring approach or an oversight in identifying valid \\( w \\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Reevaluating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's revisit the original equation and see if there's a simpler way to identify valid \\( w \\) values without overlooking cases.\n\n**Original Equation:**\n\\[ lw = 4l + 4w \\]\n\\[ lw - 4l - 4w = 0 \\]\n\\[ l(w - 4) = 4w \\]\n\\[ l = \\frac{4w}{w - 4} \\]\n\n**Key Insight:**\n\nFor \\( l \\) to be an integer, \\( \\frac{4w}{w - 4} \\) must simplify to an integer, meaning \\( w - 4 \\) must be a divisor of \\( 16 \\).\n\n**Therefore:**\n\\[ w - 4 \\text{ must divide } 4w \\]\n\\[ w - 4 \\text{ divides } 16 \\]\n\n**Valid \\( w \\) Values Greater Than 4:**\n- \\( w = 5 \\) (i.e., \\( w - 4 = 1 \\))\n- \\( w = 6 \\) (i.e., \\( w - 4 = 2 \\))\n- \\( w = 8 \\) (i.e., \\( w - 4 = 4 \\))\n- \\( w = 12 \\) (i.e., \\( w - 4 = 8 \\))\n- \\( w = 20 \\) (i.e., \\( w - 4 = 16 \\))\n\n**Confirmed by Testing:**\n\nAll these \\( w \\) values lead to integer \\( l \\) values, and the cool condition holds, except for \\( w = 11 \\) where \\( l \\) isn't an integer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt seems that the divisor approach correctly identifies the valid \\( w \\) values, and the earlier oversight with \\( w = 11 \\) is resolved by realizing that not all divisors lead to valid integer solutions.\n\n**Final List of Valid \\( w \\) Values:**\n\n- \\( w = 5, 6, 8, 12, 20 \\)\n\n**Corresponding \\( l \\) Values:**\n\n- \\( w = 5 \\Rightarrow l = 20 \\)\n- \\( w = 6 \\Rightarrow l = 12 \\)\n- \\( w = 8 \\Rightarrow l = 8 \\)\n- \\( w = 12 \\Rightarrow l = 6 \\)\n- \\( w = 20 \\Rightarrow l = 5 \\)\n\n**Check:**\n\nEach pair satisfies the cool condition:\n\\[ A = l \\times w = 2P = 2 \\times 2(l + w) \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Calculating the Sum of All Possible Areas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we have all the valid \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) pairs, let's calculate the corresponding areas and find their sum.\n\n**Valid Rectangles and Their Areas:**\n\n1. \\( l = 20, w = 5 \\)\n   - **Area \\( A = 100 \\)**\n   \n2. \\( l = 12, w = 6 \\)\n   - **Area \\( A = 72 \\)**\n   \n3. \\( l = 8, w = 8 \\)\n   - **Area \\( A = 64 \\)**\n   \n4. \\( l = 6, w = 12 \\)\n   - **Area \\( A = 72 \\)**\n   \n5. \\( l = 5, w = 20 \\)\n   - **Area \\( A = 100 \\)**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNotice that the areas \\( 100 \\) and \\( 72 \\) are repeated when considering both orientations (length and width can be swapped). However, the problem asks for the sum of all **different** possible areas, so we should only count each unique area once.\n\n**Unique Areas:**\n- \\( 100, 72, 64 \\)\n\n**Sum of Unique Areas:**\n\\[ 100 + 72 + 64 = 236 \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nMake sure we didn't miss any valid \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) pairs:\n- All divisor combinations of \\( w - 4 \\) that lead to integer \\( l \\) have been tested.\n- Only unique areas are counted.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sum of all different possible areas of cool rectangles is **236**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout this process, I started with an algebraic approach, testing integer values for \\( w \\) to find corresponding \\( l \\) values. Initially, I noticed that not all integer \\( w \\) values worked, leading to the insight that \\( w - 4 \\) needed to be a divisor of \\( 16 \\). This pattern helped identify valid \\( w \\) values, ensuring \\( l \\) was an integer.\n\nI verified each \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) pair by checking the cool condition, and by considering both orientations (length and width), I accounted for all unique areas. Finally, summing these unique areas yielded the correct solution.\n\nThis step-by-step exploration, including brainstorming, testing, reflecting, and adjusting strategies, ensured a comprehensive and accurate solution to the problem.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe sum of all the different possible areas of cool rectangles is **236**.",
