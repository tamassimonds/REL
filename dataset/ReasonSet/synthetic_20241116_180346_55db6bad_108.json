    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's approach this problem just like how I'd tackle it as a human\u2014brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting on whether they're working, and adjusting as needed. I'll write down my thoughts, check my progress often, and be open to changing directions if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem: \n\n**Alexio has 100 cards numbered 1 to 100. He picks one card at random. What\u2019s the probability that the number on the card is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5? Express the answer as a common fraction.**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of basic probability problems where you need to determine the likelihood of picking a number that meets certain criteria.\n\n- **Is this familiar?** Yes, I've tackled similar problems before where you find probabilities involving multiples. \n\n- **What stands out?** The requirement to find numbers that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5. At first glance, it seems like a straightforward counting problem. But then again, I remember that simply counting multiples individually might lead to overcounting\u2014multiples of both 2 and 3, for instance, are also multiples of 6.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:** \n  1. **Direct Counting:** Count all numbers that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5.\n  2. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Consider counting each set of multiples and subtracting overlaps to avoid overcounting.\n  3. **Complementary Counting:** Count the numbers that are **not** multiples of 2, 3, or 5 and subtract from 100.\n  \n- **Brainstorming:** \n  - **Direct Counting** seems simple, but I worry about double-counting those that are multiples of more than one number.\n  - **Inclusion-Exclusion** might be the way to go to accurately count all relevant multiples without overcounting.\n  - **Complementary Counting** feels like an alternative, but perhaps more complicated because I have to consider multiple conditions.\n\n- **Deciding on an Approach:** Given the potential for overcounting with direct counting, I'll start with the **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**. If it gets too messy, I might reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n\n**Thoughts:** Let's apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to ensure we count each relevant multiple only once.\n\n- **Define the Sets:**\n  - Let **A** be the set of multiples of 2.\n  - Let **B** be the set of multiples of 3.\n  - Let **C** be the set of multiples of 5.\n\n- **Inclusion-Exclusion Formula:**\n\n  \\[\n  |A \\cup B \\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap C| - |B \\cap C| + |A \\cap B \\cap C|\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:** \n\n- **Count |A|, |B|, and |C|:**\n  - **|A|:** Multiples of 2 from 1 to 100.\n    \\[\n    |A| = \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n    \\]\n  - **|B|:** Multiples of 3 from 1 to 100.\n    \\[\n    |B| = \\frac{100}{3} = 33 \\text{ (rounded down)}\n    \\]\n  - **|C|:** Multiples of 5 from 1 to 100.\n    \\[\n    |C| = \\frac{100}{5} = 20\n    \\]\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** **|B| = 33? But I thought there are 33 multiples of 3 up to 99. Let's double-check.**\n  \n  - **Quick Check:** Multiples of 3 up to 100 are 3, 6, 9, ..., 99.\n    \\[\n    99 \u00f7 3 = 33 \\text{ (correct)}\n    \\]\n  \n- **Next, Count the Intersections:**\n\n  - **|A \u2229 B|:** Multiples of both 2 and 3 are multiples of 6.\n    \\[\n    |A \\cap B| = \\frac{100}{6} = 16 \\text{ (rounded down)}\n    \\]\n  - **|A \u2229 C|:** Multiples of both 2 and 5 are multiples of 10.\n    \\[\n    |A \\cap C| = \\frac{100}{10} = 10\n    \\]\n  - **|B \u2229 C|:** Multiples of both 3 and 5 are multiples of 15.\n    \\[\n    |B \\cap C| = \\frac{100}{15} = 6 \\text{ (rounded down)}\n    \\]\n  - **|A \u2229 B \u2229 C|:** Multiples of 2, 3, and 5 are multiples of 30.\n    \\[\n    |A \\cap B \\cap C| = \\frac{100}{30} = 3\n    \\]\n\n**Applying the Formula:**\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B \\cup C| = 50 + 33 + 20 - 16 - 10 - 6 + 3 = 73\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, so according to this, there are 73 multiples of 2, 3, or 5 up to 100. That seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thoughts:** Now, let's calculate the probability based on the total number of favorable outcomes (73) over the total possible outcomes (100).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{|A \\cup B \\cup C|}{\\text{Total cards}} = \\frac{73}{100}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \n\n- **Does this make sense?** Given that 73 out of 100 cards are multiples of 2, 3, or 5, a probability of \\( \\frac{73}{100} \\) seems plausible.\n\n- **Quick Reality Check:** \n  - If all numbers are unique multiples, the probability would be higher.\n  - Considering overlaps (e.g., multiples of 6, 10, etc.) reduces the count, validating our approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:** Before concluding, let's verify if the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle was correctly applied and if the count of 73 is accurate.\n\n- **Check for Overlaps:** \n  - **|A \u2229 B| = 16:** Multiples of 6\n  - **|A \u2229 C| = 10:** Multiples of 10\n  - **|B \u2229 C| = 6:** Multiples of 15\n  - **|A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 3:** Multiples of 30\n\n- **Re-examining the Formula:**\n\n  \\[\n  |A \\cup B \\cup C| = 50 + 33 + 20 - 16 - 10 - 6 + 3\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  = 50 + 33 = 83; \\, 83 + 20 = 103; \\, 103 - 16 = 87; \\, 87 - 10 = 77; \\, 77 - 6 = 71; \\, 71 + 3 = 74 \\,\n  \\]\n\n  Oh wait, **instead of 73, I get 74.**\n\n**Realization:** \n\n- **Error Checking:** There seems to be a discrepancy. Initially, I calculated 73, but upon re-evaluation, it totals to 74. \n\n- **Possible Overlook:** Perhaps I miscounted one of the intersections or misapplied the formula.\n\n**Re-application:**\n\n- **Let's reassess the intersections:**\n\n  - **|A \u2229 B|:** 16 multiples of 6 \u2192 Correct.\n  - **|A \u2229 C|:** 10 multiples of 10 \u2192 Correct.\n  - **|B \u2229 C|:** 6 multiples of 15 \u2192 Correct.\n  - **|A \u2229 B \u2229 C|:** 3 multiples of 30 \u2192 Correct.\n\n- **Re-calculating:**\n\n  \\[\n  50 + 33 + 20 - (16 + 10 + 6) + 3 = 50 + 33 + 20 - 32 + 3 = 74\n  \\]\n\n**Confirming:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{74}{100}}  \n\\]\n\n**Final Probability:** \n\nThe probability that the number on the card Alexio chooses is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5 is \\( \\frac{74}{100} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{37}{50} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Final Answer**\n\n**Thoughts:** Let's ensure that the final probability makes sense by considering the distribution of multiples within the range.\n\n- **Distribution of Multiples:**\n  - **Multiples of 2:** 50 numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 100)\n  - **Multiples of 3:** 33 numbers (3, 6, 9, ..., 99)\n  - **Multiples of 5:** 20 numbers (5, 10, 15, ..., 100)\n  \n- **Overlaps:**\n  - **Multiples of 6 (2 & 3):** 16 numbers (6, 12, 18, ..., 96)\n  - **Multiples of 10 (2 & 5):** 10 numbers (10, 20, 30, ..., 100)\n  - **Multiples of 15 (3 & 5):** 6 numbers (15, 30, 45, ..., 90)\n  - **Multiples of 30 (2, 3 & 5):** 3 numbers (30, 60, 90)\n\n**Check:** \n\n- **Does \\( \\frac{74}{100} = \\frac{37}{50} \\approx 0.74 \\) seem reasonable?** \n\n  - Given that almost three-quarters of the numbers are multiples of at least one of 2, 3, or 5, the probability aligns with expectations.\n\n- **Alternative Verification:** \n\n  - **Counting Non-Multiples:** Perhaps another way to verify is by counting how many numbers are **not** multiples of 2, 3, or 5 and seeing if it complements to 100.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Using Complementary Counting**\n\n**Thoughts:** Let's attempt the complementary counting approach to ensure consistency with our previous result.\n\n- **Total Numbers:** 100\n\n- **Numbers that are NOT multiples of 2, 3, or 5:**\n\n  - **Strategy:** Identify numbers that are **not** multiples of 2, 3, or 5 and subtract from 100.\n  \n- **Possible Strategy:**\n\n  - **List Numbers:** Can be cumbersome, but let's try brainstorming:\n    - **Odd Numbers:** 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 (total 50)\n    - **Multiples of 3 among Odds:** Every third odd number.\n    - **Multiples of 5 among the Remaining:**\n      - After filtering out multiples of 3, check for multiples of 5.\n      \n- **Wait a Moment:** **This seems tedious. Perhaps there's a more straightforward way by calculating the proportion of numbers that **are** multiples of 2, 3, or 5 instead.**\n\n- **Reconsidering:** \n\n  - **Perhaps not the best path. Let's stick with the Inclusion-Exclusion approach, ensuring accuracy there.**\n\n- **Conclusion:** Complementary counting is possible but would require more effort and is prone to error; thus, I'll rely on the verified Inclusion-Exclusion result.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nAfter carefully applying the **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**, double-checking calculations, and verifying the consistency of the approach, the probability that the number on the card Alexio chooses is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{37}{50}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Was the initial approach correct?** Initially, I calculated \\( \\frac{73}{100} \\), but upon re-evaluating, the correct count is \\( \\frac{74}{100} \\), simplifying to \\( \\frac{37}{50} \\).\n\n- **Did brainstorming help?** Absolutely. Considering different strategies like direct counting and complementary counting guided me towards the Inclusion-Exclusion method.\n\n- **What did I learn?** Being open to rechecking and verifying each step is crucial to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Would I approach differently next time?** While Inclusion-Exclusion was effective, perhaps starting with a small sample check to validate the overlapping counts could streamline the process.\n\nThis thinking process mimics human-like problem-solving\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting\u2014leading to the correct and final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "There are 50 numbers between 1-100 inclusive which are divisible by 2 --- all the even numbers. To avoid overcounting, we must find all the odd multiples of 3. Beginning with 3, the sequence of all such numbers is $3, 9, 15\\cdots99$, which gives $\\dfrac{99-3}{6}+1=17$ such numbers.\n\nFinally, we must find all odd multiples of 5 which are not divisible by 3.
