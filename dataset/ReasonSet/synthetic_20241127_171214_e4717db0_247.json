  "problem": "When $0.\\overline{36}$ is expressed as a common fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's weave these thoughts into a seamless, coherent solution while preserving the original approach and final answer. \n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into converting \\(0.\\overline{36}\\) (which repeats as 0.363636...) into a common fraction in its lowest terms and then finding the sum of the numerator and denominator.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**  \n- This seems like a repeating decimal problem. I recall that using the **Algebraic Method**\u2014setting up equations to eliminate the repeating part\u2014is an effective strategy. I\u2019ll keep other methods like recognizing patterns or using geometric series in mind just in case, but starting with algebra makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Converting the Repeating Decimal to a Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI'll assign the repeating decimal to a variable and manipulate it to eliminate the repeating part.\n\n**Approach:**  \n- Let\u2019s set:\n  \\[\n  x = 0.\\overline{36}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  Since the repeating block is two digits (36), multiplying both sides by 100 will shift the decimal point two places to the right, aligning the repeating parts.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n100x = 36.\\overline{36}\n\\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Yes, this aligns perfectly because both sides now have the same repeating decimal.\n\n**Next Step:**  \nSubtract the original equation from this new equation to eliminate the repeating part:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n100x &= 36.\\overline{36} \\\\\nx &= 0.\\overline{36} \\\\\n\\hline\n99x &= 36 \\quad \\text{(Subtracting both equations)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\):**  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{36}{99}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, this fraction can likely be simplified. Let's proceed to reduce it to its lowest terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo simplify \\(\\frac{36}{99}\\), I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 36 and 99.\n\n**Approach:**  \n- I\u2019ll use the **Euclidean Algorithm** to find the GCD quickly.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n99 \\div 36 &= 2 \\quad \\text{remainder } 27 \\\\\n36 \\div 27 &= 1 \\quad \\text{remainder } 9 \\\\\n27 \\div 9 &= 3 \\quad \\text{remainder } 0 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n- **GCD is 9.**\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{36}{99} = \\frac{36 \\div 9}{99 \\div 9} = \\frac{4}{11}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes \\(\\frac{4}{11}\\) convert back to \\(0.\\overline{36}\\)? Performing a quick division:\n\n\\[\n4 \\div 11 \\approx 0.363636\\ldots\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGreat! The simplified fraction accurately represents the original repeating decimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Sum of the Numerator and Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have the fraction in its lowest terms, I need to find the sum of the numerator and denominator.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n4 + 11 = 15\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The fraction is correctly simplified, and the sum is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution Summary**\n\nAfter converting \\(0.\\overline{36}\\) into a fraction using the algebraic method and simplifying it, the fraction is \\(\\frac{4}{11}\\). Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:**  \n  Starting with the algebraic method was effective, but being open to other strategies ensured flexibility in problem-solving.\n\n- **Continuous Reflection:**  \n  Regularly checking each step prevented errors and confirmed the correctness of the solution.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  Verifying the simplified fraction by converting it back to a decimal reinforced the accuracy of the solution.\n\nBy thoughtfully navigating through each step, reflecting, and verifying, I've confidently arrived at the correct answer.",
  "ground_truth": "$0.\\overline{36}=\\frac{36}{99}=\\frac{4}{11}$. The sum of the numerator and denominator is $4+11=\\boxed{15}$."
