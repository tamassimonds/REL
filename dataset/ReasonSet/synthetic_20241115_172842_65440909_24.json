    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem just as I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're correct, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. It's important to think aloud, so I'll share all my thoughts, including uncertainties and moments of clarity. Let's begin!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see the question about how many zeroes are in \\(1000!\\), my initial reaction is:\n\n- **Familiarity:** This reminds me of problems involving factors of ten. I recall that zeroes at the end of a number are created by factors of 10, which are composed of 2 and 5.\n  \n- **Idea Spark:** Maybe I need to count how many pairs of 2s and 5s are in the factorial. Since there are usually more 2s than 5s, perhaps the number of 5s determines the number of zeros.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** But wait, is that the right approach? I've done similar things before, but \\(1000!\\) is a huge number, and counting individual factors directly would be impractical.\n\n- **Alternative Thoughts:** Perhaps there's a formula or a shortcut I can use instead of manually counting each factor.\n\nAt this point, I'm leaning toward counting the number of 5s because I remember that in factorials, 2s are more abundant than 5s. But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll explore further.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Counting Factors of 5:**\n   - **Initial Idea:** Since a pair of 2 and 5 creates a 10, and there are generally more 2s than 5s, the number of zeros is determined by the number of 5s.\n   - **Thought Process:** This seems logical because, in any factorial, factors of 2 are plentiful. But how do I count the 5s without listing every number up to 1000?\n\n2. **Using Legendre's Formula:**\n   - **Alternative Idea:** I remember Legendre's formula for finding the highest power of a prime in factorials. Perhaps I could apply this for the prime number 5.\n   - **Reflection:** This sounds like a more systematic approach. It might save me from manually counting each multiple of 5.\n\n3. **Direct Multiplication Approach:**\n   - **Another Idea:** Calculate \\(1000!\\) directly and see how many trailing zeros it has.\n   - **Realization:** This is impractical. \\(1000!\\) is enormous, and calculating it directly isn\u2019t feasible with standard methods.\n\n4. **Combining Strategies:**\n   - **Final Thought:** Combining the counting factors of 5 with Legendre's formula seems like a robust approach. Legendre's formula provides a structured way to count primes in factorials, which should work well here.\n\nI think I should proceed with **Counting Factors of 5** using **Legendre\u2019s Formula** as it seems the most efficient and reliable method.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Chosen Strategy**\n\nLet me detail how Legendre's formula applies here:\n\n- **Legendre\u2019s Formula:** To find the highest power of a prime \\(p\\) that divides \\(n!\\), sum the integer divisions of \\(n\\) by \\(p\\), \\(p^2\\), \\(p^3\\), and so on, until \\(p^k > n\\).\n  \n- **Applying to Our Problem:**\n  - Let \\(n = 1000\\) and \\(p = 5\\).\n  - Calculate \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{625} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n  - Stop when the divisor exceeds 1000.\n\nBut before proceeding, let me **reflect** on whether this approach makes sense. Since we're breaking down \\(1000\\) by powers of 5, and each step accounts for multiples of 5, 25, etc., it should accurately count the factors of 5 contributing to trailing zeros in \\(1000!\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations step by step:\n\n1. **First Term:**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 200 \\right\\rfloor = 200\n   \\]\n   - **Thought:** This counts all multiples of 5 up to 1000.\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{25} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 40 \\right\\rfloor = 40\n   \\]\n   - **Thought:** These are multiples of 25, each contributing an extra factor of 5.\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{125} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 8 \\right\\rfloor = 8\n   \\]\n   - **Thought:** Multiples of 125 contribute yet another factor of 5.\n\n4. **Fourth Term:**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{625} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 1.6 \\right\\rfloor = 1\n   \\]\n   - **Thought:** There's only one multiple of 625 within 1000.\n\n5. **Next Term:**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{3125} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 0.32 \\right\\rfloor = 0\n   \\]\n   - **Thought:** Multiples of 3125 exceed 1000, so we stop here.\n\n### **Summing the Results**\n\n\\[\n200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Adding these up gives us 249. This number represents the total count of factors of 5 in \\(1000!\\), which directly corresponds to the number of trailing zeros.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does this number seem reasonable? Given that each multiple of 5, 25, 125, etc., contributes to a trailing zero, a count of 249 feels plausible for \\(1000!\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Verifying the Approach**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me **double-check** the logic:\n\n- **Does Counting 5s Make Sense?** Yes, because every trailing zero in a factorial comes from a pair of 2 and 5, and there are always more 2s than 5s.\n\n- **Is Legendre\u2019s Formula Applicable?** Absolutely, it\u2019s designed for this purpose.\n\n- **Are the Calculations Correct?** I\u2019ve walked through each step carefully, and the numbers add up correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach Consideration**\n\nWhile I\u2019m confident in the counting 5s strategy, let\u2019s briefly consider if there\u2019s another way to solve this:\n\n- **Prime Factorization Method:** Another approach could involve finding the prime factorization of \\(1000!\\) and counting the pairs of factors that make 10. However, this would be much more complex and time-consuming compared to our current method.\n\n- **Direct Calculation:** As mentioned earlier, attempting to calculate \\(1000!\\) directly is impractical.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Counting factors of 5 remains the most efficient and straightforward method.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nLooking back, initiating the solution by brainstorming different strategies and selecting the most efficient one helped streamline the process. Applying Legendre\u2019s formula provided a systematic way to count the necessary factors without getting bogged down by the sheer size of \\(1000!\\).\n\nThroughout the steps, checking each calculation and reflecting on whether the approach was correct ensured accuracy. Recognizing that there are always more factors of 2 than 5 clarified that counting 5s sufficed to determine the number of trailing zeros.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter meticulously counting the factors of 5 in \\(1000!\\) using Legendre\u2019s formula, the number of trailing zeroes in \\(1000!\\) is **249**.\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through each step, exploring different strategies, and reflecting on the correctness of the approach, I arrived at the final answer confidently. This methodical process ensured that even with the complexity of \\(1000!\\), the solution was both accurate and efficient.",

  "ground_truth": "You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $1000!$. Since $10=2\\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are. We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.\n\nTo count how many times a number is divisible by $5$, we divide $1000$ by $5$ to get $200$. Each of those two hundred numbers has a factor of $5$.\n\nNext, how many of the numbers are divisible by $5^2=25$? Dividing $1000$ by $25$, we get $40$. Each of them has two factors of $5$. We've already counted one of them for each number, so for these forty multiples of $25$, we need to add a factor for each to our count.\n\nNext, we need to look at numbers that have $5^3=125$ in them. Eight of our numbers are divisible by $125$, so we count $8$ more factors of $5$.\n\nFinally, we look at $5^4=625$. There is only one number among $1$ through $1000$ divisible by $625$, and that number is $625$, so we only need to count one more factor of $5$. Since $5^5$ is too big, we can stop here.\n\nThis gives a total of $200+40+8+1=249$ factors of $5$ in $1000!$, so it has $\\boxed{249}$ zeroes on the end."
