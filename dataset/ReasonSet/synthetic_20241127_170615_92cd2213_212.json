  "solution": "Absolutely, let's weave this into a polished, coherent solution while preserving the original thought process. I'll maintain the conversational tone, reflect naturally, and ensure the flow is smooth.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were doing it on paper. The question asks for the absolute value of the difference between the solutions of the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ \nx^2 - 5x + 5 = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Quadratic Formula:** My initial thought is to use the quadratic formula since it\u2019s a straightforward method to find the roots of any quadratic equation.\n- **Factoring:** Maybe factoring could work, but the coefficients don't look like they\u2019d factor nicely.\n- **Completing the Square:** Another method, but it might be more cumbersome than using the quadratic formula.\n- **Graphical Interpretation:** Visualizing the roots on a graph could help, but it wouldn\u2019t give an exact numerical answer.\n\nHmm, the quadratic formula seems like the most reliable and efficient approach here. I'll start with that, but I'll keep other methods in mind in case I need to cross-check.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Quadratic Formula**\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nFor our equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 5 = 0\\), we have:\n\n- \\(a = 1\\)\n- \\(b = -5\\)\n- \\(c = 5\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me plug these values into the formula. I need to calculate the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)) first to see what kind of roots I'm dealing with.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1.1: Calculating the Discriminant**\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 25 - 20 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe discriminant is 5, which is positive. This means there are two distinct real roots. That's good; it aligns with the expectation for a quadratic equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Roots**\n\nNow, I'll plug the discriminant back into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{5}}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the two solutions are:\n\n\\[\nx_1 = \\frac{{5 + \\sqrt{5}}}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_2 = \\frac{{5 - \\sqrt{5}}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThese expressions look correct. I\u2019ll proceed to find the difference between these roots as the problem asks.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Difference Between the Roots**\n\nThe difference between the two roots is:\n\n\\[\nx_1 - x_2 = \\frac{{5 + \\sqrt{5}}}{2} - \\frac{{5 - \\sqrt{5}}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\nx_1 - x_2 = \\frac{{(5 + \\sqrt{5}) - (5 - \\sqrt{5})}}{2} = \\frac{{5 + \\sqrt{5} - 5 + \\sqrt{5}}}{2} = \\frac{{2\\sqrt{5}}}{2} = \\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat simplification went smoothly. The difference between the roots is \\(\\sqrt{5}\\). Since the problem asks for the absolute value, and \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) is already positive, we're all set.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me double-check everything:\n\n- **Discriminant Calculation:** \\(25 - 20 = 5\\) \u2014 Yup, that's correct.\n- **Roots Calculation:** Plugging into the quadratic formula gave sensible roots.\n- **Difference Simplification:** The algebra checks out, leading to \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\nEverything seems correct. The absolute value of the difference between the solutions is indeed \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\nEven though the quadratic formula worked perfectly, let's briefly consider other methods to ensure our solution's robustness.\n\n**Factoring:**\n\nInitially, I thought about factoring the quadratic, but looking at \\(x^2 - 5x + 5\\), it doesn't factor neatly with integer roots. So, factoring isn't practical here.\n\n**Completing the Square:**\n\nI could try completing the square, but it would likely lead me back to the same expressions obtained via the quadratic formula. Let me attempt it to verify.\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^2 - 5x + \\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 + 5 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(x - \\frac{5}{2})^2 - \\frac{25}{4} + 5 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(x - \\frac{5}{2})^2 - \\frac{5}{4} = 0\n\\]\n\nAdding \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n(x - \\frac{5}{2})^2 = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[\nx - \\frac{5}{2} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nCompleting the square yields the same roots as the quadratic formula. This confirms that our earlier solution is correct.\n\n**Graphical Interpretation:**\n\nIf I were to graph \\(x^2 - 5x + 5\\), the parabola would intersect the x-axis at \\(\\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\). The distance between these roots on the graph would be \\(\\sqrt{5}\\), aligning with our calculated difference.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies and cross-verifying the results, I'm confident that the absolute value of the difference between the solutions is indeed \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, reflecting at each stage, and considering alternative methods, I ensured the correctness of the solution. The quadratic formula proved to be the most efficient strategy, but verifying with completing the square added an extra layer of confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough a thoughtful and methodical approach, utilizing the quadratic formula and validating with alternative methods, we determined that the absolute value of the difference between the quadratic equation's solutions is \\(\\sqrt{5}\\). Keeping an open mind to different strategies and reflecting at each step ensured the solution's accuracy and reliability.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the roots of this polynomial be $r_1$ and $r_2$. Since the sum of the roots of a polynomial $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $-\\frac{b}{a}$ and the product of the roots is $\\frac{c}{a}$, $r_1+r_2=5$ and $r_1r_2=5$. Squaring the first equation results in $r_1^2+2r_1r_2+r_2^2=25$.\n\nNotice that $(r_1-r_2)^2=r_1^2-2r_1r_2+r_2^2$, so the difference of the roots can be obtained by subtracting 4 copies of the product of the roots from the square of their sum: $r_1^2-2r_1r_2+r_2^2=r_1^2+2r_1r_2+r_2^2-4r_1r_2=25-4(5)=5$. Therefore, $|r_1-r_2|=\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}$.\n\nWe also could have used the quadratic formula to determine that the roots are $\\dfrac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$, and the positive difference of these roots is indeed $\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}$."
