  "solution": "Sure, let's put this together into a polished, coherent solution while retaining the original thought process. We'll ensure clarity and logical flow, emulating a natural problem-solving journey.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nSimplify the following expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{n+4} - 2(2^n)}{2(2^{n+3})}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Approaching the Problem**\n\nWhen faced with this expression involving exponents, my initial instinct is to simplify both the numerator and denominator to see if common factors can be canceled out. I recall that factoring and applying exponent rules often help in such scenarios. However, I'm not entirely sure which method will be the most efficient, so exploring different strategies is essential.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Factoring Out Common Terms:**  \n   Perhaps factoring \\(2^n\\) from the numerator could simplify things.\n\n2. **Simplifying Exponents:**  \n   Using exponent rules to combine or break down the terms.\n\n3. **Canceling Common Factors:**  \n   Once simplified, see if the numerator and denominator have common factors that can be canceled.\n\n4. **Substituting a Value for \\(n\\):**  \n   Plugging in a specific value for \\(n\\) to verify the simplification.\n\n**Chosen Strategy:**  \nI'm leaning towards **factoring out common terms** as it often leads to simplification in fractional expressions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplifying the Numerator by Factoring**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLooking at the numerator \\(2^{n+4} - 2(2^n)\\), I notice that both terms contain \\(2^n\\). Factoring \\(2^n\\) might make the expression easier to handle.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n2^{n+4} - 2(2^n) = 2^n \\times 2^4 - 2 \\times 2^n = 16 \\times 2^n - 2 \\times 2^n\n\\]\n\\[\n= (16 - 2) \\times 2^n = 14 \\times 2^n\n\\]\n\n**Result:**  \nThe numerator simplifies to \\(14 \\times 2^n\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis simplification looks correct because factoring out \\(2^n\\) leaves us with \\(16 - 2 = 14\\). So far, so good.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe denominator is \\(2(2^{n+3})\\). I can simplify this by applying exponent rules to combine the terms.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n2 \\times 2^{n+3} = 2^1 \\times 2^{n+3} = 2^{1 + (n+3)} = 2^{n+4}\n\\]\n\n**Result:**  \nThe denominator simplifies to \\(2^{n+4}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nInteresting! The denominator simplifies neatly to \\(2^{n+4}\\), which aligns well with the numerator's exponent. This might facilitate canceling out common terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Forming the Simplified Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWith both numerator and denominator simplified, I can rewrite the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14 \\times 2^n}{2^{n+4}}\n\\]\n\nIt appears that the \\(2^n\\) terms in the numerator and denominator can be canceled.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{14 \\times 2^n}{2^{n+4}} = \\frac{14}{2^{n+4}/{2^n}} = \\frac{14}{2^4} = \\frac{14}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Result:**  \nThe fraction simplifies to \\(\\frac{14}{16}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a moment\u2014\\(\\frac{14}{16}\\) can be reduced further since both 14 and 16 are divisible by 2. Let's proceed to simplify it completely.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Reducing \\(\\frac{14}{16}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo simplify \\(\\frac{14}{16}\\), I'll divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{14}{16} = \\frac{14 \\div 2}{16 \\div 2} = \\frac{7}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Result:**  \nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy reducing \\(\\frac{14}{16}\\) to \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\), the fraction is now fully simplified. This step ensures completeness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution with a Specific Value**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo confirm the correctness of the simplification, I'll substitute \\(n = 1\\) into the original expression and check if the result matches \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\).\n\n**Original Expression with \\(n = 1\\):**  \n\\[\n\\frac{2^{1+4} - 2(2^1)}{2(2^{1+3})} = \\frac{2^5 - 2 \\times 2}{2 \\times 2^4}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{32 - 4}{32} = \\frac{28}{32} = \\frac{7}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Verification Result:**  \nThe simplified fraction is indeed \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\), which aligns perfectly with our earlier result.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe verification confirms that our simplification steps were correct. Substituting a specific value for \\(n\\) provided consistency, reinforcing the validity of the approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}\n\\]\n\n<ANSWER>\\(\\frac{7}{8}\\)</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Reflecting on the Solution Process**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:**  \n  Factoring out \\(2^n\\) in the numerator was an effective starting point, leading to straightforward simplification.\n\n- **Simplifying Exponents:**  \n  Combining exponents in the denominator streamlined the fraction, making it easier to cancel common terms.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  Substituting \\(n = 1\\) served as a practical check, confirming the correctness of the simplified expression.\n\n- **Final Check:**  \n  Reducing \\(\\frac{14}{16}\\) to \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) ensured that the fraction was fully simplified.\n\nOverall, the step-by-step approach, including verification, allowed for a confident and accurate solution. Exploring different strategies and reflecting at each step helped in maintaining clarity and correctness throughout the problem-solving process.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBy systematically applying factoring and exponent rules, coupled with a verification step, the original expression was successfully simplified to \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\).
