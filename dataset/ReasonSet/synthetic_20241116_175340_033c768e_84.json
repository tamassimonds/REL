    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see how we can tackle it. I'll walk you through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed. It might get a bit messy, but that's part of thinking through a problem like a human would.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem asks for the number of **even perfect square factors** of \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^9\\).  \n\n- **Perfect square factors:** Hmm, I remember that a perfect square has all even exponents in its prime factorization. So, I guess I need to look at the exponents of the primes involved and see which combinations result in even exponents.\n  \n- **Even factors:** Oh right, an even number must have at least one \\(2\\) in its prime factorization. So, I need to ensure that in my perfect square factors, the exponent of \\(2\\) is at least 2.\n\n  **Initial Brainstorming:**\n  \n  - **Strategy 1:** List all perfect square factors and filter out the odd ones. But that seems tedious, especially with high exponents like \\(7^9\\).\n  \n  - **Strategy 2:** Use combinatorics to count the valid exponents for each prime.\n  \n  - **Strategy 3:** Consider the total number of perfect square factors first and then subtract the odd ones.\n  \n  - **Strategy 4:** Factor out the necessary \\(2\\) to ensure evenness and then count the perfect squares.\n\n  I think **Strategy 2** or **Strategy 4** might be the most efficient. Strategy 1 seems too time-consuming, and Strategy 3 could get messy. Let's start with Strategy 4 to see if it leads us in the right direction.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Factor Out the Necessary \\(2\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Since the factor needs to be even, let's ensure there's at least one \\(2\\) in the factor. This means the exponent of \\(2\\) in our perfect square factor must be at least 2.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  - Original expression: \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^9\\)\n  \n  - Factor out \\(2^2\\): \n  \n    \\[\n    2^2 \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 7^9) = 2^2 \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 7^9)\n    \\]\n  \n  - This simplifies to: \n  \n    \\[\n    2^2 \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 7^9)\n    \\]\n  \n  - But wait, that seems redundant. Let's just keep it as:\n  \n    \\[\n    2^2 \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 7^9)\n    \\]\n  \n  - Hmmm, I think I mistyped there. Let's clarify: We're factoring out \\(2^2\\), leaving \\(2^2 \\cdot 7^9\\) inside the parentheses.\n\n    \\[\n    2^2 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 7^9 = 2^4 \\cdot 7^9\n    \\]\n    \n    Wait, that brings us back to the original. Maybe I should just keep it as is to avoid confusion.\n\n    **Realization:** This doesn't seem to progress the problem. Let's try a different approach.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, that didn't help much. I think I need to rethink how I'm factoring out the \\(2\\). Instead of trying to factor it out entirely, maybe I should just focus on ensuring the exponent of \\(2\\) in the perfect square factor is at least 2.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Determine Valid Exponents for Each Prime**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Let's look at the exponents in the prime factorization and see which combinations result in even exponents for perfect squares, ensuring the exponent of \\(2\\) is at least 2.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  - **Prime \\(2\\):** Exponent must be even and at least 2.\n    \n    Possible exponents: \\(2, 4\\)\n    \n  - **Prime \\(7\\):** Exponent can be any even number up to \\(9\\).\n    \n    Possible exponents: \\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\)\n  \n  - **Combining Exponents:**\n    \n    - For each valid exponent of \\(2\\), pair it with each valid exponent of \\(7\\).\n\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align*}\n    \\text{Exponent of } 2: & \\quad 2, 4 \\\\\n    \\text{Exponent of } 7: & \\quad 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 \\\\\n    \\end{align*}\n    \\]\n\n    So, total combinations: \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\).\n\n    **Wait:** That seems too simple. I feel like I'm missing something here.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, counting the combinations this way might overlook the requirement that exponents must be even. Let me think about it again. I need to ensure that for perfect squares, all exponents are even, not just those of \\(2\\) and \\(7\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Reassess the Exponent Requirements**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Reconsider the requirement that all exponents in the perfect square factor must be even. Let's list out the possible exponents that maintain this condition.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  - **Exponent of \\(2\\):** Must be \\(2\\) or \\(4\\).\n  \n  - **Exponent of \\(7\\):** Must be \\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\).\n  \n  - **Total Combinations:**\n    \n    For each exponent of \\(2\\):\n    \n    - Exponent \\(2\\): Can pair with \\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\) \u2192 5 options.\n    \n    - Exponent \\(4\\): Can also pair with \\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\) \u2192 5 options.\n    \n    Total: \\(5 + 5 = 10\\).\n  \n    **Hmm:** This still feels off. I think I'm double-counting or maybe missing some combinations.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI need to ensure that each combination of exponents results in a perfect square and is even. Let's refine the approach.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Use Combinatorial Counting**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Think of the problem as selecting exponents for each prime that meet the perfect square condition.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  - **Prime \\(2\\):** Exponent must be even and at least 2.\n  \n    Possible exponents: \\(2, 4\\)\n  \n  - **Prime \\(7\\):** Exponent must be even and within the available range.\n  \n    Possible exponents: \\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\)\n  \n  - **Counting Valid Combinations:**\n    \n    For each valid exponent of \\(2\\), count the number of valid exponents of \\(7\\).\n    \n    - Exponent \\(2\\): Can pair with \\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\) \u2192 5 options.\n    \n    - Exponent \\(4\\): Can pair with \\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\) \u2192 5 options.\n  \n    Total valid combinations: \\(5 + 5 = 10\\).\n  \n  **Check:** Does this make sense? Each combination should represent a unique even perfect square factor.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe counting seems correct now. By ensuring that both exponents are even and at least one \\(2\\) is present, we're accurately capturing the even perfect square factors.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Verify by Listing Some Combinations**\n\n- **Thought Process:** To be sure, let's list a few combinations to see if they fit the criteria.\n\n- **Example Combinations:**\n  \n  - \\(2^2 \\cdot 7^0 = 4\\) \u2192 Perfect square, even\n  - \\(2^2 \\cdot 7^2 = 4 \\cdot 49 = 196\\) \u2192 Perfect square, even\n  - \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^0 = 16\\) \u2192 Perfect square, even\n  - \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^2 = 16 \\cdot 49 = 784\\) \u2192 Perfect square, even\n  \n  **Observation:** All these factors are even perfect squares, which aligns with our combinatorial count.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nListing a few examples confirms that our approach is correct. The counting method reflects the actual number of even perfect square factors.\n\n---\n\n**Final Step: Conclude with the Total Count**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Based on the combinatorial counting, the total number of even perfect square factors is the sum of all valid exponent combinations.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  - Total valid combinations: \\(10\\)\n  \n  - Therefore, the number of even perfect square factors is **10**.\n  \n  **Final Answer:**  \n  \\[\n  \\boxed{10}\n  \\]\n  \n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThroughout the process, I explored different strategies, identified where I might be oversimplifying or missing details, and adjusted my approach accordingly. By using combinatorial counting and verifying with specific examples, I'm confident that the number of even perfect square factors of \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^9\\) is indeed **10**.",

  "ground_truth": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions."
