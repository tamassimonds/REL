  "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ is an isosceles triangle with side lengths of 25, 25 and 48 centimeters. What is the area of triangle $ABC$, in square centimeters?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking it through naturally. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have an isosceles triangle \\( ABC \\) with sides \\( 25 \\, \\text{cm}, 25 \\, \\text{cm}, \\) and \\( 48 \\, \\text{cm} \\). Since it's isosceles, the two equal sides are \\( 25 \\, \\text{cm} \\) each, and the base is \\( 48 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\nI'm reminded of previous problems involving isosceles triangles where I've used the **Pythagorean theorem** or **Heron's formula** to find the area. Let me brainstorm a bit to decide the best approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Pythagorean Theorem:**  \n   - Since it's isosceles, maybe I can draw an altitude from the apex to the base, splitting the triangle into two right triangles. This could help me find the height.\n\n2. **Heron's Formula:**  \n   - I could use Heron's formula since all sides are known, but I remember it involves calculating the semi-perimeter and can get a bit messy with large numbers.\n\n3. **Trigonometry:**  \n   - Using sine or cosine rules to find angles and then the area, but that seems more complicated.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe **Pythagorean theorem** approach feels the most straightforward because it directly gives me the height, which I need to calculate the area. Heron's formula is another option, but I prefer to start with the simpler method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Drawing the Altitude**\n\nLet me visualize this. If I draw an altitude from the apex (where the two equal sides meet) to the midpoint of the base \\( 48 \\, \\text{cm} \\), it should split the base into two equal parts of \\( 24 \\, \\text{cm} \\) each.\n\n- **Thought:**  \n  This creates two right triangles with legs of \\( 24 \\, \\text{cm} \\) and the altitude (which I'll call \\( h \\)), and the hypotenuse being \\( 25 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nFor one of these right triangles:\n\n\\[\n25^2 = 24^2 + h^2\n\\]\n\n- **Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n625 = 576 + h^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh^2 = 625 - 576 = 49\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{49} = 7 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n\\(\\sqrt{49} = 7\\) makes sense. So, the height is \\( 7 \\, \\text{cm} \\). This seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Area Using the Height**\n\nNow that I have the height, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 48 \\times 7 = 24 \\times 7 = 168 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication. \\( 24 \\times 7 \\) should be:\n\n\\[\n24 \\times 7 = 140 + 28 = 168\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nYep, that\u2019s correct. The area is \\( 168 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Heron's Formula as a Backup**\n\nJust to confirm, let's briefly consider Heron's formula to see if it matches.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Semi-Perimeter (\\( s \\))**\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{25 + 25 + 48}{2} = 49 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n2. **Apply Heron's Formula**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{49(49-25)(49-25)(49-48)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{49 \\times 24 \\times 24 \\times 1} = \\sqrt{28224} = 168 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nHeron's formula also gives \\( 168 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\), which matches our previous calculation. This confirms the correctness of the Pythagorean approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBoth methods\u2014using the Pythagorean theorem and Heron's formula\u2014yield the same area. This consistency reassures me that the solution is correct.\n\n<ANSWER>\n\nThe area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is **168 square centimeters**.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies and verifying the solution with multiple methods, I ensured the accuracy of the area calculation. Thinking through the problem step by step, checking calculations, and reflecting at each stage helped in arriving at the correct answer.",

Thus, $AD=\\frac{48}{2}=24$. Now we see $ABD$ is a 7-24-25 right triangle, so $BD=7$. Calculating the area of $ABC$, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 48 \\cdot 7=24 \\cdot 7=\\boxed{168} \\text{sq cm}$."
