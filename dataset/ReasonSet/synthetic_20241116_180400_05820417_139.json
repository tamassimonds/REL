    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were solving it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect and check my work often, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I notice several components:\n\n- **Given:** \\( x \\) is a multiple of \\( 15336 \\).\n- **Function:** \\( f(x) = (3x + 4)(7x + 1)(13x + 6)(2x + 9) \\).\n- **Goal:** Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( x \\).\n\nImmediately, I recognize that this involves understanding how \\( f(x) \\) behaves relative to \\( x \\), especially since \\( x \\) is a multiple of \\( 15336 \\). It reminds me of problems where factoring or modular arithmetic might be useful.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Factoring \\( f(x) \\):** Maybe I can factor \\( f(x) \\) and see how it's related to \\( x \\).\n   \n2. **Evaluate \\( f(x) \\) for Specific Multiples of \\( 15336 \\):** Plugging in specific values might give insights, though it won't work for all cases.\n   \n3. **Use Modular Arithmetic:** Since \\( x \\) is a multiple of \\( 15336 \\), perhaps modular reductions could simplify parts of \\( f(x) \\).\n   \n4. **Checking Divisibility:** See if each term in \\( f(x) \\) is divisible by \\( x \\) or a divisor of \\( x \\).\n\nAt this point, factoring seems like a promising start, but I'm not entirely sure. So, I'll begin by attempting to factor \\( f(x) \\).\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Factor \\( f(x) \\)**\n\nLet's try to factor \\( f(x) \\) to see if it reveals any common factors with \\( x \\).\n\n\\[\nf(x) = (3x + 4)(7x + 1)(13x + 6)(2x + 9)\n\\]\n\nLooking at each term:\n\n- \\( 3x + 4 \\)\n- \\( 7x + 1 \\)\n- \\( 13x + 6 \\)\n- \\( 2x + 9 \\)\n\nI notice that each term is a linear polynomial in \\( x \\). Factoring them individually doesn't seem straightforward. Perhaps I could look for patterns, but nothing obvious jumps out. \n\n**Reflection:** This doesn't seem to lead anywhere immediately. Factoring wasn't helpful, so I need to consider another approach.\n\n### **Step 2: Trying Modular Arithmetic**\n\nSince factoring didn't work, let's think about using modular arithmetic. Given that \\( x \\) is a multiple of \\( 15336 \\), maybe evaluating \\( f(x) \\) modulo \\( x \\) could help.\n\n**Idea:** If \\( f(x) \\equiv 0 \\mod x \\), then \\( f(x) \\) is divisible by \\( x \\).\n\nLet's compute \\( f(x) \\mod x \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x) = (3x + 4)(7x + 1)(13x + 6)(2x + 9)\n\\]\n\nReducing each term modulo \\( x \\):\n\n- \\( 3x + 4 \\equiv 4 \\mod x \\)\n- \\( 7x + 1 \\equiv 1 \\mod x \\)\n- \\( 13x + 6 \\equiv 6 \\mod x \\)\n- \\( 2x + 9 \\equiv 9 \\mod x \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nf(x) \\equiv 4 \\times 1 \\times 6 \\times 9 \\mod x\n\\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 1 = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n4 \\times 6 = 24\n\\]\n\\[\n24 \\times 9 = 216\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nf(x) \\equiv 216 \\mod x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This means \\( f(x) \\) is \\( 216 \\) more than a multiple of \\( x \\). So, \\( f(x) \\) is not necessarily divisible by \\( x \\), but the GCD of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( x \\) should still be considered carefully.\n\n### **Step 3: Checking GCD Using Properties**\n\nEven though \\( f(x) \\) isn't divisible by \\( x \\), the GCD might still be a common divisor of \\( x \\) and \\( 216 \\) since \\( f(x) \\equiv 216 \\mod x \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- \\( \\gcd(f(x), x) \\) should divide \\( f(x) \\).\n- Since \\( f(x) \\equiv 216 \\mod x \\), the GCD must also divide \\( 216 \\).\n- Additionally, since \\( x \\) is a multiple of \\( 15336 \\), the GCD must divide both \\( 216 \\) and \\( 15336 \\).\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. Factor \\( 15336 \\) to see its prime components.\n2. Factor \\( 216 \\) to see its prime components.\n3. Find the GCD of \\( 216 \\) and \\( 15336 \\).\n\n### **Step 4: Factoring \\( 216 \\) and \\( 15336 \\)**\n\nLet's start with \\( 216 \\):\n\n\\[\n216 = 2^3 \\times 3^3\n\\]\n\nNow, let's factor \\( 15336 \\):\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI recall that \\( 15336 \\) is an even number, so it should be divisible by \\( 2 \\). Let's divide repeatedly by \\( 2 \\):\n\n\\[\n15336 \\div 2 = 7668\n\\]\n\\[\n7668 \\div 2 = 3834\n\\]\n\\[\n3834 \\div 2 = 1917\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( 1917 \\) is odd, so let's check for divisibility by \\( 3 \\):\n\nSum of digits of \\( 1917: 1 + 9 + 1 + 7 = 18 \\), which is divisible by \\( 3 \\).\n\n\\[\n1917 \\div 3 = 639\n\\]\n\nAgain, check \\( 639 \\) for divisibility by \\( 3 \\):\n\n\\[\n6 + 3 + 9 = 18 \\div 3 = 639 \\div 3 = 213\n\\]\n\nNow, check \\( 213 \\) for divisibility by \\( 3 \\):\n\n\\[\n2 + 1 + 3 = 6 \\div 3 = 213 \\div 3 = 71\n\\]\n\nFinally, \\( 71 \\) is a prime number.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the prime factorization of \\( 15336 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n15336 = 2^3 \\times 3^3 \\times 71\n\\]\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the GCD of \\( 216 \\) and \\( 15336 \\)**\n\nNow that we have both factorizations:\n\n- \\( 216 = 2^3 \\times 3^3 \\)\n- \\( 15336 = 2^3 \\times 3^3 \\times 71 \\)\n\nThe GCD is the product of the lowest powers of the common prime factors:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(216, 15336) = 2^3 \\times 3^3 = 216\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nThis matches our earlier intuition because \\( f(x) \\) is congruent to \\( 216 \\mod x \\), meaning \\( f(x) \\) has \\( 216 \\) as a common divisor with \\( x \\).\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Result**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s double-check to ensure everything makes sense:\n\n- **Does \\( f(x) \\equiv 216 \\mod x \\) imply that \\( \\gcd(f(x), x) \\) is \\( 216 \\)?**\n  \n  Yes, because \\( \\gcd(f(x), x) \\) divides \\( f(x) \\) and \\( x \\), and since \\( f(x) \\equiv 216 \\mod x \\), it must also divide \\( 216 \\).\n\n- **Is \\( 216 \\) a divisor of \\( x \\) since \\( x \\) is a multiple of \\( 15336 \\)?**\n\n  Yes, because the GCD of \\( 216 \\) and \\( 15336 \\) is \\( 216 \\), meaning \\( x \\) must be divisible by \\( 216 \\).\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nEverything aligns. The GCD of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( x \\) is indeed \\( 216 \\).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe greatest common divisor of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( x \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{216}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThroughout this process, I explored different strategies\u2014factoring \\( f(x) \\), using modular arithmetic, and finding the GCD through prime factorization. Initially, factoring \\( f(x) \\) didn't yield much, so I pivoted to considering the relationship between \\( f(x) \\) and \\( x \\) via modular reductions. This led me to realize that the GCD is closely tied to the divisibility properties of \\( 216 \\) and \\( 15336 \\). By verifying each step and reflecting on whether the approach made sense, I ensured the correctness of the final answer.\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough captures the thought process effectively, mirroring a human's natural problem-solving journey.",

  "ground_truth": "In $f(x)$, all terms will have a multiple of $x$ except for the constant term, which is the multiple of the four constants $4,1,6$, and $9$.\n\nRecall (from the Euclidean algorithm) that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $a-kb$ where $k,a,$ and $b$ are any integers. Therefore, finding the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is the same as finding the greatest common divisor of $x$ and the constant term of $f(x)$.
