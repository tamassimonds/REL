    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through just as I would if I were tackling it for the first time.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I notice that it involves the composition of a function, specifically \\( y = f(f(x)) \\). The given points on the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) are \\( (1, 5) \\), \\( (2, 3) \\), and \\( (3, 1) \\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Composition of Functions:** I remember that composing functions means taking the output of one function and using it as the input for another. So, \\( f(f(x)) \\) means applying \\( f \\) to \\( f(x) \\).\n- **Given Points:** The points provided are likely crucial for determining which points lie on \\( y = f(f(x)) \\).\n\nBut honestly, I'm a bit unsure how to start. Composing functions can get tricky, especially without knowing the entire function \\( f(x) \\). Maybe there's a pattern or property I can exploit.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Composition Approach:** Try to compute \\( f(f(x)) \\) using the given points.\n2. **Mapping Inputs Through \\( f(x) \\):** See how each input maps through \\( f(x) \\) and then find the corresponding outputs.\n3. **Using Fixed Points or Inverses:** Consider if there are fixed points or if \\( f \\) is invertible.\n4. **Looking for Patterns or Symmetries:** Perhaps there's a pattern in the mappings that can help.\n\n**Wait...** The first strategy seems straightforward, but I'm realizing that without knowing the entire function, it might not work. Maybe I need to map the inputs step by step.\n\n**Thinking It Over:** The second strategy, mapping inputs through \\( f(x) \\), seems promising. Let's give that a try.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Mapping Through \\( f(x) \\)**\n\nLet's start by seeing how each given point behaves under \\( f(x) \\).\n\n1. **Mapping \\( x = 1 \\):**\n   - From the point \\( (1, 5) \\), we know \\( f(1) = 5 \\).\n   - **But wait**, there's no point provided for \\( x = 5 \\). Does this mean \\( f(5) \\) is unknown?\n\n2. **Mapping \\( x = 2 \\):**\n   - From \\( (2, 3) \\), \\( f(2) = 3 \\).\n   - Still, no immediate information about \\( f(3) \\) since \\( (3, 1) \\) is outside this.\n\n3. **Mapping \\( x = 3 \\):**\n   - From \\( (3, 1) \\), \\( f(3) = 1 \\).\n   - Hmm, I notice that \\( f(3) = 1 \\) is actually part of the point \\( (1, 5) \\). So, does this imply \\( f(1) = 5 = f(f(3)) \\)?\n\n**Reflection:** There seems to be a relationship among the points, but without more details about \\( f(x) \\), it's hard to proceed. Maybe I need to look for patterns or properties like cycles or fixed points.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking for Patterns or Fixed Points**\n\nThinking about the mappings, I remember that if \\( f(a) = b \\) and \\( f(b) = a \\), then \\( (a, b) \\) is a fixed point under the composition. Let's see if any such pairs exist.\n\n- **From \\( (1, 5) \\):** \\( f(1) = 5 \\).\n- **From \\( (2, 3) \\):** \\( f(2) = 3 \\).\n- **From \\( (3, 1) \\):** \\( f(3) = 1 \\).\n\n**Hmm...**\n\n- If \\( f(3) = 1 \\) and \\( f(1) = 5 \\), then applying \\( f \\) again, \\( f(f(3)) = f(1) = 5 \\).\n- Similarly, \\( f(f(2)) = f(3) = 1 \\).\n\n**Realization:** This suggests that \\( f(f(3)) = 5 \\) and \\( f(f(2)) = 1 \\). So, the points \\( (2, 1) \\) and \\( (3, 5) \\) seem to be on the graph of \\( y = f(f(x)) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Identifying the Points on \\( y = f(f(x)) \\)**\n\nBased on the above mapping:\n\n1. **For \\( x = 2 \\):**\n   - \\( f(2) = 3 \\)\n   - Then, \\( f(f(2)) = f(3) = 1 \\)\n   - So, the point \\( (2, 1) \\) is on \\( y = f(f(x)) \\).\n\n2. **For \\( x = 3 \\):**\n   - \\( f(3) = 1 \\)\n   - Then, \\( f(f(3)) = f(1) = 5 \\)\n   - So, the point \\( (3, 5) \\) is on \\( y = f(f(x)) \\).\n\n**Checking:** \n\n- Does this make sense? \n  - Yes, because \\( f(f(2)) = 1 \\) and \\( f(f(3)) = 5 \\), aligning with the given points.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation: \\( ab + cd \\)**\n\nNow that we've identified the points \\( (2, 1) \\) and \\( (3, 5) \\) on \\( y = f(f(x)) \\), let's assign them:\n\n- Let \\( (a, b) = (2, 1) \\)\n- Let \\( (c, d) = (3, 5) \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nab + cd = 2 \\times 1 + 3 \\times 5 = 2 + 15 = 17\n\\]\n\n**Wait, let me double-check:**\n\n- \\( 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\)\n- \\( 2 + 15 = 17 \\)\n\n**Reflection:** The calculations seem correct. The points \\( (2, 1) \\) and \\( (3, 5) \\) fit the mapping, and the arithmetic checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and checking the mappings carefully, I've concluded that the points \\( (2, 1) \\) and \\( (3, 5) \\) must be on the graph of \\( y = f(f(x)) \\). Therefore,\n\n\\[\nab + cd = 17\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:** \n\n- Initially, I was unsure how to begin, but mapping through \\( f(x) \\) helped clarify the relationships.\n- Checking for fixed points and cycles within the composition was key to identifying the correct points.\n- It's always helpful to reflect and double-check each step to ensure the accuracy of the final answer.\n\nRemember, tackling such problems often requires trying different approaches, checking for consistency, and being open to reassessing strategies when something doesn't seem right.",
