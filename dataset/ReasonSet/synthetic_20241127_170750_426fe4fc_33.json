  "solution": "### **Complete Solution: Finding the Value of \\(a\\) for Collinear Points**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper\u2014exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Question:** We have three points \\((3,-5)\\), \\((-a + 2, 3)\\), and \\((2a+3,2)\\) that lie on the same line. We need to find the value of \\(a\\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Hmm, this looks like a collinearity problem. I remember that if three points lie on the same line, the slopes between any two pairs of points should be the same. But honestly, it's been a while since I dealt with such problems, so I'm a bit rusty. Let's brainstorm some strategies to tackle this.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Slope Method:** Calculate the slope between different pairs of points and set them equal since the slopes must be the same for collinear points.\n\n2. **Determinant Method:** Use the determinant approach to check collinearity, where the area of the triangle formed by the points should be zero.\n\n3. **Equation of a Line:** Find the equation of the line passing through two of the points and see if the third point satisfies it.\n\n- **Thoughts:** The **Slope Method** seems straightforward, and it's the first thing that comes to mind. But let's keep the other methods in mind in case this doesn't work out.\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Slope Method**\n\n**Idea:**  \nCalculate the slope between the first and second points, and then between the first and third points. Set these slopes equal because the points lie on the same line.\n\n#### **Calculating Slope Between First and Second Points**\n\n\\[\nm_1 = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{3 - (-5)}{(-a + 2) - 3} = \\frac{8}{-a - 1}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Okay, so the slope \\(m_1\\) is \\(\\frac{8}{-a - 1}\\). Looks good so far.\n\n#### **Calculating Slope Between First and Third Points**\n\n\\[\nm_2 = \\frac{2 - (-5)}{(2a + 3) - 3} = \\frac{7}{2a}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** The second slope \\(m_2\\) is \\(\\frac{7}{2a}\\). No immediate issues here.\n\n#### **Setting Slopes Equal**\n\nSince the points are collinear:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{-a - 1} = \\frac{7}{2a}\n\\]\n\n- **Thoughts:** Now, let's solve this equation for \\(a\\). Cross-multiplying seems like the way to go.\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Equation**\n\n#### **Cross-Multiplying**\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 2a = 7 \\times (-a - 1) \\implies 16a = -7a - 7\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, let me double-check that. Yup, looks correct.\n\n#### **Rearranging the Equation**\n\n\\[\n16a + 7a = -7 \\implies 23a = -7\n\\]\n\n#### **Calculating \\(a\\)**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-7}{23}\n\\]\n\n- **Thoughts:** Hmm, so \\(a = \\frac{-7}{23}\\). That seems like a valid answer, but let me verify it to be sure.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Check Using the Third Point:**  \nLet's plug \\(a = \\frac{-7}{23}\\) back into the coordinates of the second and third points to ensure consistency.\n\n#### **Calculating the Second Point's \\(x\\)-Coordinate**\n\n\\[\nx_2 = -a + 2 = -\\left(\\frac{-7}{23}\\right) + 2 = \\frac{7}{23} + \\frac{46}{23} = \\frac{53}{23}\n\\]\n\n- **Coordinate:** \\(\\left(\\frac{53}{23}, 3\\right)\\)\n\n#### **Calculating the Third Point's \\(x\\)-Coordinate**\n\n\\[\nx_3 = 2a + 3 = 2 \\times \\frac{-7}{23} + 3 = \\frac{-14}{23} + \\frac{69}{23} = \\frac{55}{23}\n\\]\n\n- **Coordinate:** \\(\\left(\\frac{55}{23}, 2\\right)\\)\n\n#### **Calculating Slopes Again**\n\n##### **Slope Between First and Second Points**\n\n\\[\nm_1 = \\frac{3 - (-5)}{\\frac{53}{23} - 3} = \\frac{8}{\\frac{53}{23} - \\frac{69}{23}} = \\frac{8}{\\frac{-16}{23}} = -\\frac{8 \\times 23}{16} = -\\frac{184}{16} = -\\frac{23}{2}\n\\]\n\n##### **Slope Between First and Third Points**\n\n\\[\nm_2 = \\frac{2 - (-5)}{\\frac{55}{23} - 3} = \\frac{7}{\\frac{55}{23} - \\frac{69}{23}} = \\frac{7}{\\frac{-14}{23}} = -\\frac{7 \\times 23}{14} = -\\frac{161}{14} = -\\frac{23}{2}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Both slopes \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are \\(-\\frac{23}{2}\\), which are equal. This confirms that the points are collinear with the calculated \\(a\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Alternative Method Check**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nJust to be extra sure, let's briefly consider the **Determinant Method**. If the determinant of the matrix formed by the points is zero, they are collinear.\n\n#### **Setting Up the Matrix**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n3 & -5 & 1 \\\\\n-a + 2 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n2a + 3 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= 0\n\\]\n\n#### **Calculating the Determinant**\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times \\begin{vmatrix}\n3 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n- (-5) \\times \\begin{vmatrix}\n-a + 2 & 1 \\\\\n2a + 3 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n+ 1 \\times \\begin{vmatrix}\n-a + 2 & 3 \\\\\n2a + 3 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= 0\n\\]\n\n##### **Calculating Each Minor**\n\n1. **First Minor:**\n\n\\[\n3 \\times (3 \\times 1 - 2 \\times 1) = 3 \\times 1 = 3\n\\]\n\n2. **Second Minor:**\n\n\\[\n+5 \\times ((-a + 2) \\times 1 - (2a + 3) \\times 1) = 5 \\times (-a + 2 - 2a - 3) = 5 \\times (-3a - 1) = -15a - 5\n\\]\n\n3. **Third Minor:**\n\n\\[\n+1 \\times ((-a + 2) \\times 2 - (2a + 3) \\times 3) = 2(-a + 2) - 3(2a + 3) = -2a + 4 - 6a - 9 = -8a - 5\n\\]\n\n##### **Putting It All Together**\n\n\\[\n3 - 15a - 5 - 8a - 5 = 0 \\implies -23a - 7 = 0 \\implies a = \\frac{-7}{23}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** The determinant method also yields \\(a = \\frac{-7}{23}\\). This consistency strengthens our solution.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nAfter exploring multiple methods and verifying the solution, we confidently conclude that the value of \\(a\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{a = \\frac{-7}{23}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBy taking a methodical approach\u2014starting with brainstorming, applying the slope method, verifying through calculations, and cross-checking with an alternative method\u2014we ensured the correctness of our solution. It's always beneficial to validate your answer using different strategies to confirm accuracy.",
