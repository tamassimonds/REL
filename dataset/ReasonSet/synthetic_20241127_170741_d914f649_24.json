  "solution": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, emulating a natural human thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect along the way, and adjust my approach as needed. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the question:\n\n> If \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\) for all \\( x \\), then what line is necessarily an axis of symmetry of the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\)?\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- **Symmetry Problem:** This looks like a symmetry issue.\n- **Familiarity:** I remember seeing functional equations like this before\u2014symmetry around a specific line.\n- **Curiosity:** But wait, what does \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\) really imply?\n\n**Brainstorming Ideas:**\n- **Vertical Line Symmetry:** Maybe the graph is symmetric about a vertical line.\n- **Possibility of \\( x = 1 \\):** Could it be \\( x = 1 \\) since \\( 2 - x \\) involves 2?\n- **Uncertainty:** Not entirely sure, but I think it relates to midpoints.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Need for Confirmation:** I need to confirm whether \\( x = 1 \\) is indeed the axis of symmetry.\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Let\u2019s explore different strategies to see if this holds.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Analyzing the Functional Equation**\n\n- **Thought:** If \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\), then for every point \\( (x, f(x)) \\), there\u2019s a corresponding point \\( (2 - x, f(x)) \\). This suggests symmetry.\n- **Wait a Moment:** Does this mean the graph is symmetric about \\( x = 1 \\)?\n\n**Strategy 2: Transforming the Equation**\n\n- **Thought:** Maybe substituting \\( z = 2 - x \\) could help simplify and see the symmetry more clearly.\n- **Alternative Idea:** Or perhaps setting \\( x = 1 + h \\) to see deviations from the midpoint.\n\n**Unsure Which to Choose:**\n- **Starting Point:** Both strategies seem valid. Let\u2019s start with Strategy 1 and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Strategy 1 \u2013 Analyzing the Functional Equation**\n\n**Approach:**\n- For every \\( x \\), there exists another point \\( 2 - x \\) with the same function value.\n- This suggests that points are mirrored around a specific line.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Midpoint Consideration:** If \\( x \\) and \\( 2 - x \\) have the same \\( f(x) \\), the midpoint between \\( x \\) and \\( 2 - x \\) might be the axis of symmetry.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Compute the midpoint:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Midpoint} = \\frac{x + (2 - x)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Midpoint Is \\( x = 1 \\):** The midpoint is \\( x = 1 \\).\n- **Indication:** This indicates that the line \\( x = 1 \\) is the axis of symmetry.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Does It Make Sense?:** Yes, because for any \\( x \\), \\( 2 - x \\) is equally distant from 1.\n\n**Conclusion of Step:**\n- **Wait a Sec:** This seems straightforward, but let\u2019s verify with another strategy to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with Strategy 2 \u2013 Substitution Method**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Let\u2019s substitute \\( z = 2 - x \\) to see how the function behaves.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Substitution Insight:** If \\( z = 2 - x \\), then \\( x = 2 - z \\).\n- **Equation Transformation:** The equation becomes \\( f(2 - z) = f(z) \\).\n\n**Rewriting:**\n- Original: \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\)\n- Substituted: \\( f(2 - z) = f(z) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Confirmation of Symmetry:** This substitution confirms that the function is symmetric around \\( z = 1 \\) (since \\( x = 2 - z \\)).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Does Substituting Back Make Sense?:** Yes, it aligns with the original equation.\n\n**Conclusion of Step:**\n- **Consistency:** Both strategies point to \\( x = 1 \\) being the axis of symmetry.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Confirming with a Sample Function**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Let\u2019s test with an example function to see if \\( x = 1 \\) holds as the axis of symmetry.\n\n**Sample Function:**\n- Suppose \\( f(x) = (x - 1)^2 \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Checking the Condition:** Check if \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\).\n- **Calculations:**  \n  \\[\n  f(x) = (x - 1)^2  \n  f(2 - x) = (2 - x - 1)^2 = (1 - x)^2 = (x - 1)^2 = f(x)\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Condition Satisfied:** The condition \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\) is satisfied.\n- **Axis of Symmetry:** The axis of symmetry is \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Graph Verification:** Does the graph of \\( f(x) = (x - 1)^2 \\) have symmetry around \\( x = 1 \\)? Yes, it's a parabolic curve centered at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion of Step:**\n- **Sample Function Confirmation:** The sample function confirms that \\( x = 1 \\) is the axis of symmetry.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification and Conclusion**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Re-examine the original functional equation and the steps taken to ensure correctness.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Consistency Across Strategies:** All strategies (analyzing the equation, substitution, and sample function) consistently point to \\( x = 1 \\) as the axis of symmetry.\n- **No Contradictions:** No contradictions or errors were found.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Final Check:** Have all possible methods been considered? Is there any chance of misinterpretation?\n- **Assurance:** Yes, multiple strategies agree, so the conclusion is reliable.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Alternative Axes:** Is there any alternative axis that could satisfy \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\)? No, only \\( x = 1 \\) balances \\( x \\) and \\( 2 - x \\).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n- **<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n  \n\\(\\boxed{\\text{<ANSWER>} x = 1 \\text{ is the axis of symmetry of the graph of } y = f(x). \\text{</ANSWER>}}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **First Thoughts:** Initially suspected \\( x = 1 \\) but needed confirmation.\n- **Brainstorming:** Considered analyzing the equation and using substitution.\n- **Reflection:** Multiple strategies validated the initial suspicion.\n- **Verification:** Sample function reinforced the conclusion.\n- **Final Check:** Consistency across all methods confirmed correctness.\n\nBy methodically exploring and verifying different strategies, we've confidently determined that \\( x = 1 \\) is the axis of symmetry.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>\nThe line \\( x = 1 \\) is necessarily an axis of symmetry of the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\).\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThrough a thoughtful, step-by-step approach\u2014starting with initial thoughts, brainstorming multiple strategies, reflecting and verifying each step with examples, and concluding with a final check\u2014we\u2019ve confidently determined that the line \\( x = 1 \\) is the necessary axis of symmetry for the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\).",
  "ground_truth": "For every point $(x,y)$ on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we know $(2-x,y)$ is also on the graph of $y=f(x)$.\n\nWe have $x = 1+(x-1)$ and $2-x = 1-(x-1)$, so the geometric transformation which takes $(x,y)$ to $(2-x,y)$ is reflection across the vertical line $\\boxed{x=1}$."
