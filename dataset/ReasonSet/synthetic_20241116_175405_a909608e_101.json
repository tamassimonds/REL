I'll walk through my initial thoughts, explore different strategies, and adjust my approach as needed, just like I would if I were tackling this problem on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the question, **\"The expansion of \\((x+1)^n\\) has 3 consecutive terms with coefficients in the ratio \\(1:2:3\\) that can be written as \\({n\\choose k} : {n\\choose k+1} : {n \\choose k+2}\\). Find the sum of all possible values of \\(n + k\\),\"** several things come to mind:\n\n1. **Binomial Coefficients:** The terms in the expansion involve \\({n\\choose k}\\), which are binomial coefficients. I remember that these coefficients have specific properties and patterns.\n\n2. **Ratios of Coefficients:** The fact that three consecutive coefficients are in the ratio \\(1:2:3\\) suggests some relationship between them. Maybe there's a way to set up equations based on this ratio.\n\n3. **Solving for \\(n\\) and \\(k\\):** Ultimately, I need to find \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) such that this ratio holds true, and then compute \\(n + k\\). \n\nAt this point, I'm not entirely sure how to proceed, but I recall that ratios of binomial coefficients often relate to the properties of Pascal's Triangle or involve manipulating factorials.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Ratio Setup:**\n   - Set up the ratio \\({n\\choose k} : {n\\choose k+1} : {n\\choose k+2} = 1 : 2 : 3\\).\n   - This would involve equations relating \\({n\\choose k}\\), \\({n\\choose k+1}\\), and \\({n\\choose k+2}\\).\n\n2. **Use of Factorials:**\n   - Express binomial coefficients in terms of factorials to simplify the ratios.\n   - Perhaps cancel out common factors to find a relationship between \\(n\\) and \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Explore Patterns in Pascal's Triangle:**\n   - See if there's a pattern or property in Pascal's Triangle that aligns with the given ratio.\n\n4. **Check for Multiple Solutions:**\n   - Since the problem asks for the sum of all possible values, consider that there might be more than one solution set \\((n, k)\\).\n\nNoticing that exploring factorials directly might be cumbersome, I think it might be easier to set up equations based on the ratios and see where that leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Ratios**\n\nLet's start by setting up the ratios as per the problem statement:\n\n\\[\n{n\\choose k} : {n\\choose k+1} : {n\\choose k+2} = 1 : 2 : 3\n\\]\n\nThis can be translated into two equations:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{{n\\choose k+1}}{{n\\choose k}} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{{n\\choose k+2}}{{n\\choose k+1}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** If I can express \\({n\\choose k+1}\\) and \\({n\\choose k+2}\\) in terms of \\({n\\choose k}\\), maybe I can find a relationship between \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) that satisfies both equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing Binomial Coefficients in Terms of Each Other**\n\nUsing the properties of binomial coefficients, I recall:\n\n\\[\n{n\\choose k+1} = \\frac{n-k}{k+1} {n\\choose k}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n{n\\choose k+2} = \\frac{n-k-1}{k+2} {n\\choose k+1}\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Equation 1 into Equation 2:**\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\n\\[\n{n\\choose k+1} = 2 {n\\choose k}\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute this into Equation 2:\n\n\\[\n{n\\choose k+2} = \\frac{3}{2} {n\\choose k+1} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 2 {n\\choose k} = 3 {n\\choose k}\n\\]\n\n**Is This Correct?**\n\nWait a second, if \\({n\\choose k+2} = 3 {n\\choose k}\\), then plugging this back into the formula for \\({n\\choose k+2}\\) doesn't seem to lead anywhere useful. Let me reflect on this.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI think setting up the ratios directly like this might be oversimplifying the problem. Perhaps I need to write out both equations more explicitly to see the relationships clearly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Revisiting the Ratio Setup**\n\nLet's reconsider the ratio setup and write out the equations more explicitly.\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{{n\\choose k+1}}{{n\\choose k}} = 2 \\implies \\frac{n-k}{k+1} = 2\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(n-k\\):\n\n\\[\nn-k = 2(k+1) = 2k + 2 \\implies n = k + 2k + 2 = 3k + 2 \\quad \\text{(Equation A)}\n\\]\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{{n\\choose k+2}}{{n\\choose k+1}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\implies \\frac{n-k-1}{k+2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(n-k-1\\):\n\n\\[\nn-k-1 = \\frac{3}{2}(k+2) = \\frac{3}{2}k + 3 \\implies n-k = \\frac{3}{2}k + 4 \\quad \\text{(Equation B)}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n- **Equation A:** \\(n = 3k + 2\\)\n- **Equation B:** \\(n-k = \\frac{3}{2}k + 4\\)\n\nLet's solve these simultaneously to find \\(n\\) and \\(k\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Equations Simultaneously**\n\nFrom **Equation A:** \n\n\\[\nn = 3k + 2\n\\]\n\nFrom **Equation B:** \n\n\\[\nn - k = \\frac{3}{2}k + 4 \\implies n = \\frac{3}{2}k + 4 + k = \\frac{5}{2}k + 4\n\\]\n\n**Setting Equation A equal to Equation B:**\n\n\\[\n3k + 2 = \\frac{5}{2}k + 4\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(k\\):**\n\n\\[\n3k - \\frac{5}{2}k = 4 - 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left(3 - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)k = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{6}{2} - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)k = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}k = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Finding \\(n\\):**\n\nUsing **Equation A:**\n\n\\[\nn = 3(4) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14\n\\]\n\n**Possible Value:**\n\n\\((n, k) = (14, 4)\\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nWait, let me quickly check if this satisfies the original ratio condition.\n\n- \\({14\\choose 4} = 1001\\)\n- \\({14\\choose 5} = 2002\\)\n- \\({14\\choose 6} = 3003\\)\n\nThe ratios are:\n\n\\[\n1001 : 2002 : 3003 = 1 : 2 : 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOh, the ratio condition is satisfied! This means \\((14, 4)\\) is indeed a solution.\n\nBut the problem asks for the **sum of all possible values of \\(n + k\\)**. This suggests that there might be other solutions as well. Let me see if there's another set of \\((n, k)\\) that also satisfies the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Exploring Additional Solutions**\n\nThinking back, the ratios \\({n\\choose k} : {n\\choose k+1} : {n\\choose k+2} = 1 : 2 : 3\\) could potentially lead to multiple solutions if different values of \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) satisfy the equations.\n\nLet's re-examine the setup to see if there are other possible integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using Ratios Differently**\n\nMaybe instead of setting up two separate equations, I can combine the ratios into one and see where that leads.\n\n**Combined Ratio:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{{n\\choose k}}{{n\\choose k+1}} = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{{n\\choose k+1}}{{n\\choose k+2}} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Expressing Both in Terms of \\({n\\choose k}\\):**\n\nUsing the properties of binomial coefficients:\n\n\\[\n{n\\choose k+1} = \\frac{n-k}{k+1} {n\\choose k}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n{n\\choose k+2} = \\frac{n-k-1}{k+2} {n\\choose k+1} = \\frac{(n-k-1)(n-k)}{(k+2)(k+1)} {n\\choose k}\n\\]\n\n**Substituting into the Ratios:**\n\nFrom \\(\\frac{{n\\choose k}}{{n\\choose k+1}} = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(k+1)}{(n-k)} = 2 \\implies n-k = \\frac{1}{2}(k+1) \\implies n = k + \\frac{1}{2}(k+1) = \\frac{3}{2}k + \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nFrom \\(\\frac{{n\\choose k+1}}{{n\\choose k+2}} = \\frac{3}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(k+2)}{(n-k-1)} = \\frac{3}{2} \\implies n-k-1 = \\frac{2}{3}(k+2) \\implies n-k = \\frac{2}{3}(k+2) + 1 = \\frac{2}{3}k + \\frac{4}{3} + 1 = \\frac{2}{3}k + \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Equating Both Expressions for \\(n-k\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2}k + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{3}k + \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(k\\):**\n\nMultiply both sides by 6 to eliminate fractions:\n\n\\[\n9k + 3 = 4k + 14\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9k - 4k = 14 - 3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5k = 11 \\implies k = \\frac{11}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, \\(k = \\frac{11}{5}\\) is not an integer. Since \\(k\\) must be an integer (as it represents the index in the binomial coefficient), this suggests that there might be no other integer solutions aside from \\((n, k) = (14, 4)\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt seems that the only integer solution is \\((n, k) = (14, 4)\\). Therefore, the sum of all possible values of \\(n + k\\) is:\n\n\\[\nn + k = 14 + 4 = 18\n\\]\n\nAh, but I also have \\(n = 3k + 2\\) and \\(n-k = \\frac{3}{2}k + 4\\). Let's see if these can lead to other integer solutions.\n\nPerhaps I can rearrange these equations to see if there's another pair \\((n, k)\\) that satisfies both.\n\nFrom \\(n = 3k + 2\\) and \\(n - k = \\frac{3}{2}k + 4\\), let's see if we can find another integer solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Seeking Additional Integer Solutions**\n\n**Rearranging the Equations:**\n\n1. From \\(n = 3k + 2\\), we have:\n   \n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{n - 2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute \\(k = \\frac{n - 2}{3}\\) into \\(n - k = \\frac{3}{2}k + 4\\):\n\n   \\[\n   n - \\frac{n - 2}{3} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{n - 2}{3} + 4\n   \\]\n\n   Simplify the left side:\n\n   \\[\n   n - \\frac{n}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2(n - 2)}{3} + 4\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3n}{3} - \\frac{n}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2n - 4}{3} + 4\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2n}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2n}{3} - \\frac{4}{3} + 4\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2n}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2n}{3} - \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{12}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2n}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2n}{3} + \\frac{8}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   **Simplification:**\n\n   Subtract \\(\\frac{2n}{3}\\) from both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   **Contradiction:**\n\n   This leads to a contradiction, indicating that there are no other integer solutions.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOh, this suggests that my only solution is \\((14, 4)\\). It seems that setting up the equations initially captured all possible integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Check**\n\nGiven that we've explored different strategies and found that \\((n, k) = (14, 4)\\) is the only integer solution that satisfies the ratio condition, let's finalize the answer.\n\n\\[\nn + k = 14 + 4 = 18\n\\]\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n- **Binomial Coefficients:**\n\n  \\({14\\choose 4} = 1001\\)\n\n  \\({14\\choose 5} = 2002\\)\n\n  \\({14\\choose 6} = 3003\\)\n\n- **Ratios:**\n\n  \\[\n  1001 : 2002 : 3003 = 1 : 2 : 3\n  \\]\n\n  **Condition Satisfied:**\n\n  The ratios are indeed \\(1 : 2 : 3\\), confirming that \\((n, k) = (14, 4)\\) is a valid solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter brainstorming different approaches, checking for additional solutions, and verifying the correctness of the solution, I confidently conclude that:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nThroughout this problem, I started by exploring various strategies, initially setting up the ratio conditions directly. When this led to a contradiction, I realized that only one integer solution existed. By meticulously following through with the equations and verifying the solution, I ensured that the final answer was accurate.\n\nReflecting on the process, it was essential to check each step and be open to re-evaluating the approach, leading to the correct and final answer.",
