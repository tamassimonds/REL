  "problem": "How many distinct, natural-number factors does $4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2$ have?",
  "solution": "Alright, looking at this problem, I need to determine how many distinct natural-number factors the expression \\(4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2\\) has. At first glance, this reminds me of problems involving prime factorization and using exponents to find factors. But honestly, I\u2019m not entirely sure of the best approach right now. Should I factor each component or maybe use a formula directly? Let me brainstorm a bit.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**  \n   - Break down each number into its prime factors to see the overall prime composition.\n   - Use the exponents of these prime factors to determine the total number of factors.\n\n2. **Using the Factor Formula Directly:**  \n   - Recall that if a number is expressed as the product of primes raised to some powers, the number of factors can be found by adding 1 to each exponent and multiplying them together.\n\n3. **Listing Factors Manually:**  \n   - Although this could work, it seems inefficient for larger exponents.\n\nHmm, listing factors manually doesn't seem practical here given the exponents. So, I think I'll start with **prime factorization** to see if that leads me anywhere and then possibly apply the **factor formula**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s break down each component of the expression into its prime factors. This should help in understanding the overall prime composition.\n\n- **\\(4^3\\):**  \n  I know that \\(4 = 2^2\\). So,  \n  \\[\n  4^3 = (2^2)^3 = 2^{2 \\times 3} = 2^6\n  \\]\n\n- **\\(5^4\\):**  \n  This is already a prime number raised to a power, so no need to break it down further.  \n  \\[\n  5^4 = 5^4\n  \\]\n\n- **\\(6^2\\):**  \n  \\(6\\) can be factored into primes as \\(2 \\times 3\\). So,  \n  \\[\n  6^2 = (2 \\times 3)^2 = 2^2 \\times 3^2\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so breaking down \\(6^2\\) was essential because it introduces another prime factor, \\(3\\), into the mix. Now, let's combine all these prime factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Combining Prime Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI need to multiply all these prime factorizations together to get a single expression involving prime numbers.\n\n\\[\n4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 3^2)\n\\]\n\n**Combining Like Terms:**  \nLet's combine the powers of \\(2\\):\n\n\\[\n2^6 \\cdot 2^2 = 2^{6+2} = 2^8\n\\]\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n2^8 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks neat. Now I have the number expressed entirely in terms of its prime factors. I think I\u2019m on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Factor Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI remember that if a number \\(N\\) is expressed as \\(p_1^{a} \\cdot p_2^{b} \\cdot p_3^{c}\\), then the total number of distinct factors of \\(N\\) is \\((a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\). Let's apply this here.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\nN = 2^8 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4\n\\]\n\n**Exponents:**\n\n- For \\(2\\): \\(8\\)\n- For \\(3\\): \\(2\\)\n- For \\(5\\): \\(4\\)\n\n**Calculating the Number of Factors:**\n\n\\[\n(8+1) \\times (2+1) \\times (4+1) = 9 \\times 3 \\times 5\n\\]\n\nNow, let's multiply these:\n\n\\[\n9 \\times 3 = 27  \n27 \\times 5 = 135\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, let me double-check this calculation to ensure it's correct. Multiplying step-by-step:\n\n- \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\)\n- \\(27 \\times 5 = 135\\)\n\nYeah, that seems correct. So, the total number of distinct natural-number factors is **135**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing the answer, it's always a good practice to verify whether the approach is correct. Let me think\u2014does this method always work? Is there another way to check?\n\n**Alternative Check:**\n\nMaybe I can list a few factors manually to see if it makes sense, but given the large number, that's impractical. However, considering that each prime factor's exponent contributes to the number of ways factors can be formed, the formula should hold.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince each exponent contributes by increasing the number of possible combinations of that prime factor in the divisors, the formula \\((a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\) makes sense. I don't see any flaws in this approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBy breaking down the original expression into its prime factors and then applying the factor formula, I determined that \\(4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2\\) has **135** distinct natural-number factors. Throughout the process, I brainstormed different strategies, verified each step, and ensured the correctness of the final answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe prime factorization method, combined with the factor formula, efficiently led to the solution. This approach not only provided the correct answer but also reinforced the understanding of how exponents and prime factors contribute to the total number of factors a number possesses.",
  "ground_truth": "We prime factorize the given number as $2^8\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^4$. A factor of this number takes the form $2^a3^b5^c$ for integers $a$ between 0 and 8, $b$ between 0 and 2, and $c$ between 0 and 4. There are $9$ ways to choose $a$, 3 ways to choose $b$, and 5 ways to choose $c$. In total, there are $9\\cdot3\\cdot5 = \\boxed{135}$ factors."
