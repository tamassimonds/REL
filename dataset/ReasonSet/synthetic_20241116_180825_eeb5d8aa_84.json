    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like how I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming various strategies, reflecting on each approach, and checking my work along the way to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see that it's about two circles with a diameter of 6 inches placed inside a 12-inch by 14-inch rectangle. The goal is to determine the greatest possible distance between the centers of these circles.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Geometry Involved:** This reminds me of geometry problems involving rectangles and circles placed within them. Perhaps considering the rectangle's dimensions and the circles' placements relative to its corners could help.\n- **Distance Calculation:** I know the distance between two points can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Maybe I can figure out the maximum distance between the centers by positioning the circles at opposite corners of the rectangle.\n- **Edge Constraints:** Since the circles have a diameter of 6 inches, their radius is 3 inches. I need to ensure that their placement doesn\u2019t extend beyond the rectangle's edges.\n\nInitially, I'm leaning towards positioning the circles at the rectangle's corners and checking if this setup works without violating the rectangle's boundaries. But let me explore this and see if it holds.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Placing Circles at Corners**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Positioning:** I'll try placing one circle at the bottom-left corner (0, 0) and the other at the top-right corner (12, 14).\n- **Checking Constraints:** Before calculating the distance, I need to ensure that both circles fit within the rectangle without overlapping or extending beyond its edges.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Circle 1 Center:** (0, 0)\n- **Circle 2 Center:** (12, 14)\n\nWait a moment\u2014these coordinates are right at the corners, but I haven't accounted for the circles' radii. Let's see if they fit:\n\n- **Circle 1:** Radius = 3 inches, so it extends from (0, 0) to (6, 6).\n- **Circle 2:** Radius = 3 inches, so it extends from (9, 11) to (12, 14).\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, I see a problem here. The edges of Circle 1 (6, 6) and Circle 2 (9, 11) do not overlap, and there's enough space between them. However, I need to ensure that the distance between their centers is indeed maximized in this setup.\n\n**Quick Check:**\nThe distance calculation seems straightforward using the Pythagorean theorem, but I'm unsure if this is the maximum possible distance considering the rectangle's dimensions.\n\n### **Realization: Adjusting the Approach**\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**\nWhile placing the circles at opposite corners seems logical, I haven't fully considered whether this setup actually maximizes the distance between their centers. Maybe there's a better way to position them within the rectangle to achieve a greater distance.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Calculating Maximum Possible Distance Within the Rectangle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Alternative Approach:** Instead of placing the circles at the corners, let's think about positioning them along the rectangle's diagonals or edges to find the maximum distance between their centers.\n- **Visualizing:** Imagine diagonals intersecting or parallel lines where the circles' centers could lie. Maybe this can lead to a greater distance.\n\n**Calculations:**\nLet's consider placing the centers of the circles at points along the diagonals:\n\n- **Circle 1 Center:** (3, 3) \u2014 3 inches from the bottom-left corner.\n- **Circle 2 Center:** (9, 11) \u2014 3 inches from the top-right corner.\n\n**Checking Constraints:**\n- **Circle 1:** Positioned 3 inches from the rectangle's edges, so it fits snugly without extending beyond.\n- **Circle 2:** Also positioned 3 inches from the edges, fitting perfectly within the rectangle.\n\n**Distance Calculation:**\nNow, let's calculate the distance between their centers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(9 - 3)^2 + (11 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = \\sqrt{100} = 10 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis distance of 10 inches seems reasonable. By placing the circles 3 inches away from their respective rectangle edges, the distance between their centers is maximized.\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n**Does this make sense?**\n- **Edge Constraints:** Both circles are 3 inches away from the rectangle's edges, ensuring they fit perfectly without overlap.\n- **Maximized Distance:** The calculated distance of 10 inches is the result of positioning the centers along the rectangle's diagonals, which likely gives the maximum separation.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Verifying with Rectangular Diagonals**\n\n**Thinking It Through Again:**\n- **Rectangular Diagonal:** The length of the rectangle's diagonal can provide insight into the maximum distance between two points within it.\n- **Diagonal Calculation:** \n  \\[\n  \\text{Diagonal} = \\sqrt{12^2 + 14^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 196} = \\sqrt{340} \\approx 18.44 \\text{ inches}\n  \\]\n  \n**Realization:**\nWait, this diagonal length seems much larger than the 10 inches calculated earlier. However, the diagonal represents the maximum straight-line distance within the rectangle itself, but the circles' placement constraints (having a radius of 3 inches) limit the proximity of their centers.\n\n**Quick Check:**\nLet me double-check if placing the circle centers at (3, 3) and (9, 11) indeed respects the rectangle's boundaries:\n\n- **Circle 1:** Extends from (0, 0) to (6, 6).\n- **Circle 2:** Extends from (9, 9) to (12, 14).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe circles do not overlap, and their centers are positioned to maximize the distance within the rectangle's constraints.\n\n### **Concluding Thoughts**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and checking the work along the way, the greatest possible distance between the centers of the two circles is **10 inches**. Placing the circles 3 inches away from the rectangle's edges ensures they fit perfectly while maximizing the distance between their centers.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **Does the distance make sense?** Yes, 10 inches is consistent with the calculated positions.\n- **Are the constraints respected?** Absolutely, each circle remains within the rectangle without overlap.\n- **Is there any alternative approach yielding a different result?** No, this method consistently leads to the same maximum distance.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**The greatest possible distance between the centers of the two circles is **10 inches**.",

  "ground_truth": "Suppose we put the two circles in opposite corners of the rectangle so that the circles are tangent to the sides of the rectangle, and they are diagonally across from each other. Then the center of each circle is 3 inches in from each side of the rectangle that it touches. Now imagine a rectangle that has opposite corners at the centers of these circles. This smaller rectangle measures 8 inches by 6 inches. The diagonal of this rectangle is the greatest possible distance between the centers of the two circles. It helps if we recognize that these lengths are $3 \\times 2$ and $4 \\times 2$, which means we have a multiple of the 3-4-5 Pythagorean Triple. Thus, the length of the diagonal must be $5 \\times 2 = \\boxed{10\\text{ inches}}$. Indeed, $8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100 = 10^2$.
