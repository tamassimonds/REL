I'll ensure it flows naturally, reflecting a step-by-step thought process.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first encounter this problem, it involves flipping a biased coin five times. The probabilities of getting heads exactly once and exactly twice are equal and non-zero. My task is to find the probability of getting heads exactly three times and express it in the form \\(\\frac{i}{j}\\), then compute \\(i + j\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This reminds me of binomial probability since we're dealing with multiple flips and specific outcomes.\n- I need to find the bias of the coin\u2014the probability of getting heads, denoted as \\(p\\).\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n- Using the binomial probability formula seems like a good starting point.\n- Setting up equations based on the given probabilities should help me solve for \\(p\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Binomial Probability Equations**\n\n**Given:**\n\n- Probability of getting heads exactly once (\\(P(1)\\)) equals the probability of getting heads exactly twice (\\(P(2)\\)).\n\n**Let\u2019s Define:**\n\n- \\(p\\) = Probability of getting heads in a single flip.\n- Therefore, \\(1 - p\\) = Probability of getting tails.\n\n**Writing the Equations:**\n\n1. **Probability of Exactly One Head (\\(P(1)\\)):**\n   \\[\n   P(1) = \\binom{5}{1} p^1 (1-p)^4 = 5p(1-p)^4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Probability of Exactly Two Heads (\\(P(2)\\)):**\n   \\[\n   P(2) = \\binom{5}{2} p^2 (1-p)^3 = 10p^2 (1-p)^3\n   \\]\n\n**Given Condition:**\n\\[\nP(1) = P(2) \\implies 5p(1-p)^4 = 10p^2 (1-p)^3\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for \\(p\\)**\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n\n- Divide both sides by \\(p\\) (assuming \\(p \\neq 0\\)) and \\((1-p)^3\\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5(1-p)^4}{(1-p)^3} = \\frac{10p^2}{p} \\implies 5(1-p) = 10p\n  \\]\n\n**Solving the Simplified Equation:**\n\\[\n5 - 5p = 10p \\implies 5 = 15p \\implies p = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This means the probability of getting heads in a single flip is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n- To ensure correctness, let's verify by plugging \\(p = \\frac{1}{3}\\) back into the original probabilities.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Calculate \\(P(1)\\):**\n  \\[\n  P(1) = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{16}{81} = \\frac{80}{243}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculate \\(P(2)\\):**\n  \\[\n  P(2) = 10 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{80}{243}\n  \\]\n  \n- Both probabilities are equal: \\(\\frac{80}{243}\\), confirming that \\(p = \\frac{1}{3}\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Probability of Exactly Three Heads (\\(P(3)\\))**\n\n**Applying the Binomial Formula:**\n\\[\nP(3) = \\binom{5}{3} p^3 (1-p)^2\n\\]\n\n**Substituting \\(p = \\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(1-p = \\frac{2}{3}\\):**\n\\[\nP(3) = 10 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\n**Calculating Step by Step:**\n\n1. **Compute \\(p^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Compute \\((1-p)^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{9}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Multiply the Components:**\n   \\[\n   P(3) = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{27} \\times \\frac{4}{9} = 10 \\times \\frac{4}{243} = \\frac{40}{243}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\n- The probability \\(P(3)\\) is \\(\\frac{40}{243}\\).\n- Double-checking the arithmetic confirms the calculation is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Expressing \\(P(3)\\) in Lowest Terms and Computing \\(i + j\\)**\n\n**Given:**\n\\[\nP(3) = \\frac{40}{243}\n\\]\n\n**Checking for Lowest Terms:**\n\n- **Numerator:** 40 = \\(2^3 \\times 5\\)\n- **Denominator:** 243 = \\(3^5\\)\n  \n**Observation:**\n\n- There are no common factors between the numerator and denominator other than 1.\n- Therefore, \\(\\frac{40}{243}\\) is already in its lowest terms.\n\n**Computing \\(i + j\\):**\n\\[\ni = 40,\\ j = 243 \\implies i + j = 40 + 243 = 283\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- Reconfirm that \\(\\frac{40}{243}\\) cannot be simplified further.\n- Recalculate \\(i + j\\) to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>283 solution</ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy following a structured approach:\n\n1. **Identified** the problem as a binomial probability scenario.\n2. **Set Up** equations for the given probabilities of exactly one and two heads.\n3. **Solved** for the probability of heads in a single flip (\\(p = \\frac{1}{3}\\)).\n4. **Calculated** the desired probability \\(P(3) = \\frac{40}{243}\\).\n5. **Ensured** the fraction was in its lowest terms and computed \\(i + j = 283\\).\n\nThroughout the process, I regularly **reflected and verified** each step to ensure the solution's correctness, ultimately arriving at the final answer of **283**.",
  "ground_truth": "Denote the probability of getting a heads in one flip of the biased coin as $h$. Based upon the problem, note that ${5\\choose1}(h)^1(1-h)^4 = {5\\choose2}(h)^2(1-h)^3$. After canceling out terms, we get $1 - h = 2h$, so $h = \\frac{1}{3}$. The answer we are looking for is ${5\\choose3}(h)^3(1-h)^2 = 10\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{40}{243}$, so $i+j=40+243=\\boxed{283}$."
