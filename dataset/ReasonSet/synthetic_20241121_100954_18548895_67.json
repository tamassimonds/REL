  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by piecing together our thought process naturally, just like a human would. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, and reflect throughout to ensure that I'm on the right track. Here's how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, let's see what we're dealing with here. The question asks:\n\n**How many integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 1000 inclusive make the decimal representation of \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) terminate?**\n\n### **Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n- **Fractions and Decimals:** This reminds me of how fractions convert to decimal forms\u2014some terminate, and some don't.\n  \n- **Factors of the Denominator:** I recall that a fraction has a terminating decimal if its denominator, in simplest form, only has prime factors of 2 and 5.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Factor the Denominator \\(1400\\):** See what prime factors it has.\n  2. **Determine Conditions on \\( n \\):** Find which integers \\( n \\) make \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) simplify to a fraction with a denominator of only 2s and 5s.\n  3. **Count Valid \\( n \\):** Figure out how many such \\( n \\) exist within the given range.\n\nI'm leaning towards starting by factoring \\(1400\\) to understand the conditions required for \\( n \\). Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Exploring Denominator's Factors**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Why Factor \\(1400\\)?** If I can break down \\(1400\\) into its prime components, I'll know which prime factors need to be canceled out by \\( n \\) for the decimal to terminate.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\n1. **Factoring \\(1400\\):**\n   - \\(1400\\) is even, so divide by 2:\n     \\[\n     1400 \\div 2 = 700 \\quad (\\text{Factor of 2})\n     \\]\n   - \\(700\\) is even, divide by 2 again:\n     \\[\n     700 \\div 2 = 350 \\quad (\\text{Another factor of 2})\n     \\]\n   - \\(350\\) is even, divide by 2 once more:\n     \\[\n     350 \\div 2 = 175 \\quad (\\text{Yet another factor of 2})\n     \\]\n   - \\(175\\) is odd, divide by 5:\n     \\[\n     175 \\div 5 = 35 \\quad (\\text{Factor of 5})\n     \\]\n   - \\(35\\) is divisible by 5:\n     \\[\n     35 \\div 5 = 7 \\quad (\\text{Another factor of 5})\n     \\]\n   - Finally, \\(7\\) is a prime number.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of \\(1400\\):**\n   \\[\n   1400 = 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Presence of Prime Factors:** I see that \\(1400\\) has prime factors 2, 5, and **7**. Since a terminating decimal requires the denominator to have only 2s and 5s, the **7** is problematic.\n\n- **Implication for \\( n \\):** To ensure the decimal terminates, \\( n \\) must cancel out the factor of 7 in the denominator.\n\n### **Check:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, because only denominators composed of 2s and 5s lead to terminating decimals.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Condition for Termination:** \\( n \\) must be a multiple of 7 to cancel out the 7 in the denominator.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Determining Condition for \\( n \\)**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Making \\( n \\) a Multiple of 7:** If \\( n \\) is a multiple of 7, say \\( n = 7k \\), then \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) simplifies to \\( \\frac{k}{200} \\). This leaves the denominator with only 2s and 5s, ensuring termination.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\n1. **Express \\( n \\) as a Multiple of 7:**\n   \\[\n   n = 7k \\quad \\text{where } k \\text{ is an integer}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplifying the Fraction:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n}{1400} = \\frac{7k}{1400} = \\frac{k}{200}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Prime Factorization of \\(200\\):**\n   \\[\n   200 = 2^3 \\times 5^2\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Resulting Denominator:** \n   - Only contains 2s and 5s, so \\( \\frac{k}{200} \\) always has a terminating decimal.\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Ensuring Termination:** By making \\( n \\) a multiple of 7, the factor of 7 in the denominator is canceled out, leaving only 2s and 5s.\n\n- **No Additional Factors:** As long as \\( k \\) is an integer, no additional prime factors are introduced to the denominator.\n\n### **Check:**\n\n- **Is This Approach Correct?** Yes, because reducing the denominator to only 2s and 5s guarantees a terminating decimal.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Requirement for \\( n \\):** \\( n \\) must be a multiple of 7 for \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) to have a terminating decimal.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Counting Valid \\( n \\) Within the Range**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Finding Multiples of 7 Between 1 and 1000:** I need to determine how many integers \\( n \\) are multiples of 7 within the given range.\n\n- **Using Arithmetic Sequences:** This reminds me of finding the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\n1. **Identify the Smallest Multiple of 7 \u2265 1:**\n   - \\( k = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     n = 7 \\times 1 = 7\n     \\]\n     \n2. **Identify the Largest Multiple of 7 \u2264 1000:**\n   - Find the largest \\( k \\) such that \\( 7k \\leq 1000 \\):\n     \\[\n     k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{7} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 142.857 \\right\\rfloor = 142\n     \\]\n   - Therefore,\n     \\[\n     n = 7 \\times 142 = 994\n     \\]\n     \n3. **List of Multiples:**\n   - Multiples of 7 from 7 to 994: \\( 7, 14, 21, \\ldots, 994 \\)\n\n4. **Total Number of Multiples:**\n   - Use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of terms} = \\frac{\\text{Last term} - \\text{First term}}{7} + 1 = \\frac{994 - 7}{7} + 1 = 142\n     \\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Calculation Seem Right?** Yes, I've identified the smallest and largest multiples of 7 within the range and calculated the total number of such multiples.\n\n- **Double-Checking:**\n  - \\( 7 \\times 142 = 994 \\leq 1000 \\): Correct.\n  - The number of terms calculation also checks out.\n\n### **Check:**\n\n- **Is 994 the Largest Multiple \u2264 1000?** Yes, because \\( 7 \\times 143 = 1001 \\), which exceeds 1000.\n\n- **Total Number of Multiples Correct?** Yes, 142 multiples fit within the range.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Total Valid \\( n \\):** There are **142** multiples of 7 between 1 and 1000.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Validating the Approach**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Ensuring Completeness:** Before finalizing, I want to make sure that no other conditions affect the termination of the decimal.\n\n- **Potential Overlook:** Is there any scenario where a multiple of 7 would still result in a non-terminating decimal? Let's consider that.\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Reviewing the Simplified Fraction:** \n  - By setting \\( n = 7k \\), \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) simplifies to \\( \\frac{k}{200} \\).\n  - Since 200's prime factors are only 2 and 5, \\( \\frac{k}{200} \\) always has a terminating decimal.\n\n- **No Additional Constraints:** There are no other prime factors in the denominator after canceling out the 7, so the condition is fully satisfied.\n\n### **Check:**\n\n- **Is Reducing \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) to \\( \\frac{k}{200} \\) Sufficient?** Yes, because the denominator is reduced to only containing prime factors of 2 and 5.\n\n- **Any Missing Factors?** No, all necessary factors are accounted for.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Final Validation:** The approach is correct, and all multiples of 7 within the specified range will result in terminating decimals.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\n**142** integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 1000 make \\( \\frac{n}{1400} \\) have a terminating decimal.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n## **Summary: The Human Thought Process**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorm:** Recognized the need to examine the denominator's factors to determine terminating decimals.\n\n- **Exploration:** Factored \\(1400\\) to identify its prime components.\n\n- **Reflection:** Realized that the presence of a prime factor other than 2 and 5 (i.e., 7) necessitates \\( n \\) to be a multiple of 7.\n\n- **Calculation:** Determined the number of multiples of 7 within the given range.\n\n- **Validation:** Checked and confirmed that reducing the fraction eliminates the unwanted prime factor, ensuring termination.\n\n- **Final Check:** Ensured all steps were logical and correct before concluding.\n\nThrough this step-by-step approach, continuously checking and reflecting on each phase, I arrived at the correct answer of **142**.",
  "ground_truth": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $1400$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $7$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1000}{7}\\right\\rfloor=142$ multiples of $7$ between $1$ and $1000$, so there are $\\boxed{142}$ integers values for $n$."
