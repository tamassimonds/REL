    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step as if I were brainstorming and working through it naturally, reflecting and checking my work along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, it reminds me of interest rate problems I've encountered before, especially those involving compounding frequencies. Here's what comes to mind:\n\n- **Compounding Frequency:** I remember that compounding monthly is different from compounding annually. Monthly compounding means the interest is applied and added to the principal each month, while annual compounding applies once a year.\n  \n- **Equivalency in Rates:** The question asks for an annual compounding rate \\(r\\) that is equivalent to a monthly compounding rate of 6%. This feels like a conversion between different compounding frequencies.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - Use the formula for effective annual rate (EAR) to find the equivalent annual rate.\n  - Maybe I could set up an equation to equalize the two compounding methods.\n  - Consider checking if there's a simple relationship between monthly and annual rates.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure if the EAR formula is the only way. Let's explore different strategies to see which works best.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Effective Annual Rate (EAR) Formula:**\n   - I recall there's a formula to convert nominal rates to effective rates when compounding more frequently than annually.\n   \n2. **Using Time Value of Money Functions:**\n   - Perhaps using future value calculations could help determine the equivalent rate.\n\n3. **Simplifying the Monthly Rate to an Annual Rate:**\n   - Maybe I can multiply the monthly rate by 12 and see if that gives a meaningful annual rate.\n\n4. **Check by Comparing Growth Over One Year:**\n   - Calculating how much the principal grows in both cases over one year might provide insight.\n\nAt this point, the **Effective Annual Rate (EAR) Formula** seems the most direct and familiar approach. However, I also want to ensure that my answer makes sense by verifying it through multiple methods if possible.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the EAR Formula**\n\nLet's start with the EAR formula for converting nominal monthly rates to an effective annual rate.\n\n\\[\n\\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{i}{n}\\right)^n - 1\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(i\\) = nominal interest rate (annual)\n- \\(n\\) = number of compounding periods per year\n\nGiven:\n- \\(i = 0.06\\) (6% annual rate)\n- \\(n = 12\\) (monthly compounding)\n\n**Thoughts:**\nWait a minute\u2014this formula is typically used to convert a nominal annual rate with more frequent compounding into an effective rate. But in this problem, we're given a monthly rate and need to find its equivalent annual rate. So, maybe I need to adjust the approach a bit.\n\n**Realization:**\nThe provided \\(i\\) is already the monthly rate nominally annualized at 6%. But to find the equivalent rate that compounds annually, I should consider how monthly compounding accumulates over a year.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Converting Monthly Rate to Annual Rate**\n\nI think I need to consider how the 6% monthly nominal rate translates into an annual rate through compounding.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n(1 + \\text{monthly rate})^{12} - 1 = \\text{equivalent annual rate}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Monthly rate = \\(0.06\\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n(1 + 0.06)^{12} - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (1.06)^{12} - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 2.012196 - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1.012196\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{EAR} = 1.012196 \\times 100\\% = 101.22\\%\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nAn effective annual rate of **101.22%** seems extremely high for a monthly compounding rate of 6%. This makes me suspect that I might have misinterpreted the initial rate or perhaps the calculation needs revisiting. But, let's proceed with another method to confirm.\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with Time Value of Money**\n\nAnother way to verify this is by calculating the future value of a principal amount under both compounding methods and ensuring they align over one year.\n\n**Assumption:**\nLet's assume the principal amount is \\$1,000 for simplicity.\n\n**Method 1: Monthly Compounding at 6%**\n\n\\[\nFV_{\\text{monthly}} = P \\times (1 + r/n)^{nt}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(P = 1,000\\)\n- \\(r = 0.06\\)\n- \\(n = 12\\) (months)\n- \\(t = 1\\) year\n\n\\[\nFV_{\\text{monthly}} = 1,000 \\times (1 + 0.06/12)^{12}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1,000 \\times (1 + 0.005)^{12}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1,000 \\times (1.005)^{12}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1,000 \\times 1.061677812\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1,061.68\n\\]\n\n**Method 2: Annual Compounding at \\(r\\)%\n\nWe need to find \\(r\\) such that:\n\n\\[\n1,000 \\times (1 + r)^{1} = 1,061.68\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(1 + r) = \\frac{1,061.68}{1,000} = 1.06168\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr = 1.06168 - 1 = 0.06168\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr = 6.168\\%\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\nWait, this gives me an annual rate \\(r = 6.168\\%\\), which is slightly different from the earlier EAR calculation (101.22%). This discrepancy suggests that there might have been an error in the initial approach or that the EAR formula needs to be applied differently.\n\n**Checking the EAR Approach:**\n\nLet's compare the two approaches to see where the difference arises.\n\n### **Step 3: Reconciling the Two Methods**\n\n**EAR Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{EAR} = (1 + 0.06)^{12} - 1 = 1.012196 \\times 100\\% = 101.22\\%\n\\]\n\n**Time Value of Money Approach:**\n\\[\nr = 6.168\\%\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe EAR method gives an unusually high rate, while the TVM method provides a more realistic annual rate. This makes me think that perhaps the EAR calculation isn't needed here since the monthly rate is already provided in nominal terms, and we're looking for the equivalent annual rate in percentage.\n\n**Realization:**\nSince the question specifies a monthly compounding rate of 6%, there's no need to apply the EAR formula directly to the nominal rate provided. Instead, the TVM approach provides a direct and accurate conversion to the equivalent annual compounding rate.\n\n### **Final Solution:**\n\nBased on the Time Value of Money calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6.17\\%}\n\\]\n\n**Rounding:**\nGiven the requirement to round to the nearest hundredth, the equivalent annual compounding rate \\(r\\) is **6.17%**.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nInitially, I considered the EAR formula, which led to an unexpectedly high rate. Upon verifying with a more straightforward approach using the Time Value of Money, I arrived at a more plausible annual rate of **6.17%**. This process highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate method based on the details provided and verifying results through multiple strategies to ensure accuracy.\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, recognizing missteps, and adjusting the approach, I was able to navigate through the problem effectively, arriving at the correct solution while reflecting and checking along the way.",
