I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work as I go to make sure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I notice that it involves finding the intersection points of two circles. My initial reaction is that this reminds me of problems where you set the equations equal to each other to find points of intersection. But then, looking closer, I recall that these equations are already set to zero, which is slightly different from the standard form I\u2019m used to.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Set Equations Equal to Each Other:** This seems straightforward\u2014if the two circles intersect, their equations equal each other at the points of intersection.\n\n2. **Complete the Square:** I remember that transforming the circle equations into their standard form might help in visualizing or simplifying the problem.\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:** Although not typically used for exact answers, sketching could provide insight into the number of intersection points.\n\n4. **Matrix Method or Substitution:** Using substitution to eliminate variables might streamline finding the intersection points.\n\n**Initial Preference:** I think starting with setting the equations equal to each other makes the most sense. If that leads to a complicated mess, I'll consider completing the square or substitution as alternatives.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting the Equations Equal**\n\nLet\u2019s start by setting the two circle equations equal to each other to find the points of intersection.\n\n**Equations:**\n\n1. \\(x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 10y + 25 = 0\\)\n2. \\(x^2 - 8x + y^2 - 10y + 37 = 0\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- By setting these equal, I should be able to eliminate one variable and solve for the other.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 10y + 25) - (x^2 - 8x + y^2 - 10y + 37) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n-2x + 8x + 25 - 37 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n6x - 12 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\n\n\\[\n6x = 12 \\implies x = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, I\u2019ve found \\(x = 2\\). At first glance, this seems straightforward, but I should check if this value leads me to the corresponding \\(y\\)-coordinates for the points of intersection.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding Corresponding \\(y\\)-Coordinates**\n\nNow that I have \\(x = 2\\), I need to substitute this back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding \\(y\\)-values.\n\n**Choosing Equation 1:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 2x + y^2 - 10y + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Substituting \\(x = 2\\):**\n\n\\[\n2^2 - 2(2) + y^2 - 10y + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n4 - 4 + y^2 - 10y + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n0 + y^2 - 10y + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\ny^2 - 10y + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nHmm, this looks like a perfect square trinomial. I should check if it factors neatly.\n\n**Factoring:**\n\n\\[\n(y - 5)^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solution:**\n\n\\[\ny - 5 = 0 \\implies y = 5\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\n\nSo, the point of intersection is \\((2, 5)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, I only have one point of intersection\u2014\\((2, 5)\\). This suggests that the two circles are tangent to each other, meaning they touch at exactly one point.\n\nThis makes sense because when I subtracted the two equations, I ended up with a single solution for \\(x\\), leading to a single solution for \\(y\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s quickly verify by plugging \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 5\\) back into both original equations to ensure they satisfy both.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Point of Intersection**\n\n**Checking Equation 1:**\n\n\\[\n(2)^2 - 2(2) + (5)^2 - 10(5) + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n4 - 4 + 25 - 50 + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = 0 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\n\n**Checking Equation 2:**\n\n\\[\n(2)^2 - 8(2) + (5)^2 - 10(5) + 37 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n4 - 16 + 25 - 50 + 37 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n-12 + 25 - 50 + 37 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n13 - 50 + 37 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = 0 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, confirming that \\((2, 5)\\) is indeed the point of intersection.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Revisiting Initial Thoughts:**\n\nI initially planned to only set the equations equal to each other, but now I wonder if completing the square could provide additional insights, like confirming the circles' centers and radii.\n\n**Alternative Strategy\u2014Completing the Square:**\n\nLet\u2019s see what the equations look like in their standard forms.\n\n**Equation 1:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 2x + y^2 - 10y + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Completing the Square for \\(x\\):**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 2x \\Rightarrow \\left(x - 1\\right)^2 - 1\n\\]\n\n**Completing the Square for \\(y\\):**\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 10y \\Rightarrow \\left(y - 5\\right)^2 - 25\n\\]\n\n**Rewriting Equation 1:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(x - 1\\right)^2 - 1 + \\left(y - 5\\right)^2 - 25 + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(x - 1\\right)^2 + \\left(y - 5\\right)^2 - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(x - 1\\right)^2 + \\left(y - 5\\right)^2 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Equation 2:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x + y^2 - 10y + 37 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Completing the Square for \\(x\\):**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x \\Rightarrow \\left(x - 4\\right)^2 - 16\n\\]\n\n**Completing the Square for \\(y\\):**\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 10y \\Rightarrow \\left(y - 5\\right)^2 - 25\n\\]\n\n**Rewriting Equation 2:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(x - 4\\right)^2 - 16 + \\left(y - 5\\right)^2 - 25 + 37 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(x - 4\\right)^2 + \\left(y - 5\\right)^2 - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(x - 4\\right)^2 + \\left(y - 5\\right)^2 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, both equations are in the standard form of a circle:  \n- Equation 1: Center \\((1, 5)\\), Radius \\(1\\)\n- Equation 2: Center \\((4, 5)\\), Radius \\(2\\)\n\nSince the distance between the centers is \\(3\\) (which is greater than the radius of the smaller circle \\(1\\) and less than the sum of the radii \\(3\\)), it confirms that the circles are tangent externally at the point \\((2, 5)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis alternative strategy aligns with our initial finding and provides a deeper understanding of the circles' relationship.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determining the Product of All Coordinates at Intersection Points**\n\n**User Query:** What is the product of all the coordinates of all the points of intersection?\n\n**Finding:** We have only one point of intersection: \\((2, 5)\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Product} = x \\times y = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSince there's only one point of intersection, the product is simply \\(10\\). If there were multiple points, I would need to consider the product of all their coordinates, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Check**\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n- **Number of Intersection Points:** Found only one point, which is consistent with external tangency.\n- **Coordinates Satisfy Both Equations:** Confirmed by substitution.\n- **Product Calculation:** Simple multiplication yields \\(10\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEverything checks out. The alternative strategy helped solidify that there\u2019s only one point of intersection, and the product calculation is correct.\n\n**Action:**\n\nI\u2019ll finalize the answer as \\(10\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy setting the circle equations equal to each other, I determined that the circles intersect at the point \\((2, 5)\\). Completing the square provided additional confirmation of the circles' properties, ensuring the solution's accuracy. The product of all coordinates at the intersection point is \\(10\\).\n\nThroughout the process, I explored different strategies, reflected on each step's correctness, and adjusted my approach as needed, which led to the correct and verified solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Add $(-2/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the first equation and $(-8/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the second equation to find that the given equations are equivalent to \\begin{align*}\n(x^2-2x+1)+(y^2-10y+25)&=1\\text{, and} \\\\\n(x^2-8x+16)+(y^2-10y+25)&=4\n\\end{align*} which are equivalent to \\begin{align*}\n(x-1)^2+(y-5)^2 &=1^2, \\\\\n(x-4)^2+(y-5)^2 &=2^2,\n\\end{align*} respectively.  Hence, the two circles have centers $(1,5)$ and $(4,5)$ respectively and radii $1$ and $2$ respectively. Since the centers of the circles are $3$ units apart and the sum of their radii is $3$, the two circles intersect at only one point.  We can see that $(2,5)$ is the desired intersection point, so our product is $2 \\cdot 5 =\\boxed{10}$."
