  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I'd naturally approach it. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and ensure to check my work along the way. If something doesn't work, I'll pivot and try another method.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming**\n\nOkay, so the question involves dividing one integer by another, with a specific quotient and remainder. It reminds me of problems involving **polynomial long division** or the **Euclidean algorithm**, but since it's tied to integer properties, maybe it's more straightforward.\n\n- **Initial Idea:** Use the **division algorithm**, which states that for integers \\( n \\) and \\( d \\), there exist unique integers \\( q \\) (quotient) and \\( r \\) (remainder) such that:\n\n  \\[\n  n = dq + r\n  \\]\n\n  Here, \\( q = x \\) and \\( r = 7 \\). Let's see if this works.\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** But the remainder is given as **7**, which is less than \\( d = 2x + 5 \\). That fits the division algorithm since the remainder must be smaller than the divisor. Okay, this confirms that using the division algorithm is a valid approach.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation Using the Division Algorithm**\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( n = x^2 + 2x + 17 \\)\n- \\( d = 2x + 5 \\)\n- Quotient \\( q = x \\)\n- Remainder \\( r = 7 \\)\n\nAccording to the division algorithm:\n\n\\[\nn = dq + r \\implies x^2 + 2x + 17 = (2x + 5)x + 7\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Expanding the Right Side:** Let's expand \\( (2x + 5)x \\) to see if both sides match.\n\n  \\[\n  (2x + 5)x = 2x^2 + 5x\n  \\]\n\n  So the equation becomes:\n\n  \\[\n  x^2 + 2x + 17 = 2x^2 + 5x + 7\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, this looks like a quadratic equation. Maybe we can simplify it to find \\( x \\).\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 2x + 17 - 2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n\\[\n-x^2 - 3x + 10 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Simplifying Further:** I don't like the negative leading coefficient. Let's multiply the entire equation by \\(-1\\) to make it easier to handle.\n\n  \\[\n  x^2 + 3x - 10 = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Does this simplification look correct? Yes, multiplying by \\(-1\\) maintains the equality.\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\nNow, we have:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 3x - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n- **Factoring:** Can this quadratic be factored easily?\n- **Quadratic Formula:** If factoring is tough, use the quadratic formula:\n\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}\n  \\]\n\n- **Completing the Square:** Another method, but might be overkill here.\n\n**First Attempt: Factoring**\n\n- Looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-10\\) and add to \\(3\\).\n\n  \\[\n  (x + 5)(x - 2) = 0\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, Let Me Check:** Does \\(5 \\times (-2) = -10\\) and \\(5 + (-2) = 3\\)? Yes, it works!\n\n**Solution:**\n\n\\[\nx + 5 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 2 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = -5 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 2\n\\]\n\n**But Remember:** The problem states that \\( x \\) is a **positive integer**, so:\n\n\\[\nx = 2\n\\]\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Verification Is Key:** Always good to plug back the value to ensure it's correct.\n\nGiven \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n- Calculate \\( n \\) and \\( d \\):\n\n  \\[\n  n = 2^2 + 2(2) + 17 = 4 + 4 + 17 = 25\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  d = 2(2) + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\n  \\]\n\n- Perform the division:\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{25}{9} = 2 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of} \\quad 7\n  \\]\n\n  (Since \\( 9 \\times 2 + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25 \\))\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Everything Matches:** The quotient is \\( 2 \\) and the remainder is \\( 7 \\), which aligns with the problem statement.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Initial Idea: Using Polynomial Division**\n\n- **Method:** Treat \\( n \\) and \\( d \\) as polynomials and perform long division.\n- **Thought Process:** But wait, since we already set up the division algorithm, this might be redundant. Still, let's explore to see if it leads us to the same conclusion.\n\n**Another Strategy: Substituting Back**\n\n- **Method:** After finding \\( x = 2 \\), substitute back into the original expressions to confirm.\n- **Reflection:** We've already done this in the verification step, so it confirms our solution is correct.\n\n**Final Strategy: Checking Constraints**\n\n- **Method:** Ensure that the remainder \\( r = 7 \\) is less than the divisor \\( d = 2x + 5 \\).\n- **Calculation:** For \\( x = 2 \\), \\( d = 9 \\), and \\( r = 7 \\), which satisfies \\( r < d \\).\n\n**Conclusion:** All strategies lead to the same solution, confirming that \\( x = 2 \\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\nsolution: \n\n\\[ x = 2 \\]\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Reflection:** By starting with the division algorithm, simplifying the resulting quadratic equation, and verifying the solution, we've confidently arrived at \\( x = 2 \\).\n- **Check:** Multiple strategies and verification steps ensure the correctness of the solution.\n- **Conclusion:** A structured, step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, checking, and reflecting, leads to an accurate and reliable answer.",
  "ground_truth": "Since we know that the quotient when we divide $n$ by $d$ is $x$ with a remainder of $7$, we can write $n/d = x + 7/d$.  Substituting for $n$ and $d$, this gives $$\\frac{x^2+2x+17}{2x+5}=x+\\frac{7}{2x+5}.$$Multiplying through by $2x+5$ gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+2x+17&=x(2x+5)+7\\\\\nx^2+2x+17&=2x^2+5x+7\\\\\n0&=x^2+3x-10\\\\\n0&=(x-2)(x+5).\n\\end{align*}Thus $x=2$ or $x=-5$. We are given that $x$ must be positive, so we have $x=\\boxed{2}$.\n\nTo check, we see that $x^2+2x+17=(2)^2+2(2)+17=25$, and $2x+5=2(2)+5=9$, and indeed, the quotient when $25$ is divided by $9$ is $x=2$, with a remainder of $7$."
