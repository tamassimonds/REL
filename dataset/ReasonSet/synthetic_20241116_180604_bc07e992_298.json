    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem the way I'd naturally approach it if I were solving it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work, and being open to changing directions if something doesn't seem right. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem\u2014finding the acute angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at 6:48\u2014I think:\n\n- **Hmm, this looks like a clock-hand angle problem I've seen before.** I remember there's a formula for it, but I'm not sure if I want to jump straight to that. Maybe visualizing it or breaking it down would help.\n  \n- **Alternatively, I could calculate the positions of both hands in degrees.** This feels more tangible. Let me think about how many degrees each hand moves per minute or hour.\n\n- **Wait, I'm recalling that each minute the minute hand moves 6 degrees.** Is it similar for the hour hand? I think it's different but needs to be adjusted based on the minutes past the hour.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use a Formula:**\n   - There's a known formula: \\( \\Theta = |30H - 5.5M| \\), where \\( H \\) is the hour and \\( M \\) is the minutes.\n   - But I need to remember, for hours, each hour mark is 30 degrees apart, and minutes contribute an extra 0.5 degrees each.\n\n2. **Calculate Angular Positions Directly:**\n   - Calculate the position of the hour hand and the minute hand in degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n   - Then, find the absolute difference and determine the acute angle.\n\n3. **Visualize the Clock:**\n   - Maybe draw a clock face and mark the positions of both hands to see the angle visually.\n   - This might help in ensuring the angle is acute.\n\n**Reflection:** Using the formula seems straightforward, but I want to ensure I understand where it comes from. Calculating positions directly could double-check the formula's validity. Visualizing might help confirm the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Positions of the Hands**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let's start by calculating the position of each hand in degrees.** This approach feels concrete.\n- **I'll calculate how far each hand has moved from the 12 o'clock position.** \n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Minute Hand:**\n  - The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes.\n  - So, each minute = \\( \\frac{360}{60} = 6 \\) degrees.\n  - At 48 minutes: \\( 48 \\times 6 = 288 \\) degrees.\n\n- **Hour Hand:**\n  - The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours.\n  - So, each hour = \\( \\frac{360}{12} = 30 \\) degrees.\n  - But we're at 6:48, so the hour hand has moved an additional part due to the 48 minutes.\n  - Each minute contributes \\( \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \\) degrees.\n  - Therefore, 48 minutes past 6:00 = \\( 48 \\times 0.5 = 24 \\) degrees.\n  - Total for the hour hand: \\( 6 \\times 30 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 \\) degrees.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Minute Hand at 288 degrees:** That seems right because it's almost a full circle.\n- **Hour Hand at 204 degrees:** 180 degrees is halfway; adding 24 degrees makes sense for 6:48.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Angle Between the Hands**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Now, let's find the difference between the two angles.** This will give us the angle between the hands.\n- **Since we're looking for the acute angle,** we should pick the smaller of the two possible angles (i.e., the difference should be less than or equal to 180 degrees).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Difference:** \\( |288 - 204| = 84 \\) degrees.\n- **Since 84 degrees is less than 180 degrees,** it's already the acute angle.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **84 degrees** makes sense as an acute angle. \n- **Quick Reflection:** I didn't need to adjust because 288 - 204 didn't exceed 180 degrees.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let me double-check if each step aligns with what I know about clock angles.** This is important to ensure no mistakes were made.\n- **Does the formula approach give the same result?** Let's see.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Using the formula \\( \\Theta = |30H - 5.5M| \\):**\n  - \\( H = 6 \\), \\( M = 48 \\)\n  - \\( \\Theta = |30 \\times 6 - 5.5 \\times 48| = |180 - 264| = | -84 | = 84 \\) degrees.\n- **This matches our earlier calculation.** So, both methods agree.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **The formula approach confirms the manual calculation.**\n- **There's consistency,** which increases confidence in the solution's correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n- **Both strategies\u2014calculating positions directly and using the formula\u2014yielded the same result: 84 degrees.**\n- **Given that 84 degrees is an acute angle,** we've successfully found the acute angle between the hour and minute hands at 6:48.\n- **Reflection:** It's always good to verify using multiple methods to ensure accuracy. Initially, I hesitated to use the formula, wanting to build intuition by calculating each hand's position. Doing both confirmed the correctness.\n\n**Final Answer:** The measure of the acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand at 6:48 is **84 degrees**.",
