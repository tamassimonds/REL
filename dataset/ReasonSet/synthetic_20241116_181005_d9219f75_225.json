    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed, just like I would if I were tackling this problem on my own.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**\"Let \\( \\mathbf{P} \\) be the matrix for projecting onto the vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -7 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Find \\( \\det \\mathbf{P} \\).\"**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of linear algebra concepts related to projection matrices. I recall that projecting onto a vector involves using a specific matrix formula, but I can't remember all the details off the top of my head.\n\n- **Similar Problems:** It feels similar to problems where you deal with orthogonal projections, maybe like projecting onto lines in space. I think I might have seen something like this with unit vectors or Gram-Schmidt processes.\n\n- **Uncertainties:** I'm not entirely sure how to construct the projection matrix \\( \\mathbf{P} \\) directly. I remember there are formulas involving dot products and outer products, but it's a bit fuzzy.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Perhaps I could start by recalling the general formula for a projection matrix. Alternatively, I could think about how to construct the matrix step by step, maybe by using the vector onto which we're projecting.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Recall the Formula for a Projection Matrix**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI vaguely remember that to project onto a vector \\( \\mathbf{a} \\), there's a matrix involved. Let me explore this.\n\n- **Strategy:** The projection matrix \\( \\mathbf{P} \\) can be defined in terms of the vector \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) onto which we're projecting. I think the formula involves the outer product of \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) with itself.\n\n- **Formula I'm Thinking Of:** \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{P} = \\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{a}^T}{\\mathbf{a}^T \\mathbf{a}}\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) is the vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -7 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** Does this make sense? Wait, the numerator is the outer product, which gives a matrix, and the denominator is a scalar (the dot product), so this should yield a matrix for projection. I think this is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate \\( \\mathbf{P} \\) Using the Formula**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's plug in the values to compute \\( \\mathbf{P} \\).\n\n1. **Compute \\( \\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{a}^T \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{a}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -7 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -7 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -28 \\\\ -28 & 49 \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compute \\( \\mathbf{a}^T \\mathbf{a} \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{a}^T \\mathbf{a} = 4 \\times 4 + (-7) \\times (-7) = 16 + 49 = 65\n   \\]\n\n3. **Construct \\( \\mathbf{P} \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{P} = \\frac{1}{65} \\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -28 \\\\ -28 & 49 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{16}{65} & -\\frac{28}{65} \\\\ -\\frac{28}{65} & \\frac{49}{65} \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** The elements in \\( \\mathbf{P} \\) are fractions, which makes sense since we're normalizing the outer product by the dot product (a scalar).\n\n- **Does This Look Right?** The matrix elements add up to fractions that seem reasonable. I think the calculation is on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Find the Determinant of \\( \\mathbf{P} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find \\( \\det \\mathbf{P} \\). I remember that for a 2x2 matrix \\( \\mathbf{P} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\), the determinant is \\( ad - bc \\).\n\n- **Formula for Determinant:** \n  \\[\n  \\det(\\mathbf{P}) = \\left(\\frac{16}{65}\\right) \\left(\\frac{49}{65}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{28}{65}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{28}{65}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, projection matrices are special. I think their determinants have specific properties. Let me recall that the determinant of a projection matrix onto a subspace can be either 0 or 1, depending on whether it's an orthogonal projection. Since we're projecting onto a vector (1-dimensional subspace), the determinant should be 0, but I'm not entirely sure why. \n\n- **Checking Again:** If the matrix is indeed a projection matrix, its determinant being 0 would imply that the projection collapses the space by one dimension, which aligns with projecting onto a line.\n\n- **Random Insight:** But the formula calculation might still be valid. It's possible for a projection matrix to have a determinant of 1 if it's an orthogonal projection, but since we're dealing with a general projection onto a vector, I think the determinant should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Determinant**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's compute the determinant to see what we get:\n\n1. **Compute \\( ad \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{16}{65}\\right) \\left(\\frac{49}{65}\\right) = \\frac{784}{4225}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compute \\( bc \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{28}{65}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{28}{65}\\right) = \\frac{784}{4225}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determinant \\( \\det(\\mathbf{P}) \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\det(\\mathbf{P}) = \\frac{784}{4225} - \\frac{784}{4225} = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Result:** The determinant is 0.\n\n- **Check:** This aligns with my earlier realization that the determinant of a projection matrix onto a 1-dimensional subspace (a vector) should be 0. \n\n- **Consistency:** The calculation confirms that \\( \\det \\mathbf{P} = 0 \\), which makes sense for a projection matrix onto a line in 2D space.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Double-Checking the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me reflect on whether the approach was correct throughout:\n\n- **Using the Projection Matrix Formula:** I started by recalling the correct formula for constructing the projection matrix \\( \\mathbf{P} \\). This step is crucial because using the wrong formula would lead to incorrect results.\n\n- **Calculating \\( \\mathbf{P} \\) Accurately:** By computing the outer product and normalizing by the dot product, I constructed \\( \\mathbf{P} \\) correctly.\n\n- **Determining the Determinant:** Although I initially hesitated about the determinant's value, the calculation supported that \\( \\det \\mathbf{P} = 0 \\). \n\n- **Alternative Strategy:** If I had doubts about the determinant being zero, I could have explored finding the eigenvalues of \\( \\mathbf{P} \\) (knowing that for projection matrices, the eigenvalues are either 0 or 1). However, since the direct calculation yielded a determinant of 0, I feel confident in the result.\n\n- **Does It Align with Theory?** According to linear algebra, the determinant of a projection matrix onto a vector (1-dimensional subspace) should indeed be 0, as it indicates that the matrix reduces the space's dimension by one.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection: Ensuring Correctness**\n\n- **Final Check:** Everything aligns with linear algebra principles. The formula used was correct, the calculations were straightforward, and the determinant reflects the properties of projection matrices.\n\n- **Confidence in Solution:** I feel confident that the determinant of the projection matrix \\( \\mathbf{P} \\) is indeed **0**. All steps logically flow from one to the next, and the mathematical operations validate the solution.\n\n- **Lesson Learned:** It\u2019s essential to ensure that the initial formula is correct when dealing with specific types of matrices like projections. Reflecting and checking each step helps avoid mistakes and confirms the validity of the result.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThrough brainstorming different strategies, recalling relevant formulas, methodically calculating each part, and reflecting on the process to ensure accuracy, I've determined that the **determinant of the projection matrix \\( \\mathbf{P} \\) is **0**. This outcome is consistent with the theoretical properties of projection matrices onto one-dimensional subspaces.\n\nFeel free to point out any part where my thinking might diverge, or if there's another approach you think I should consider!",
