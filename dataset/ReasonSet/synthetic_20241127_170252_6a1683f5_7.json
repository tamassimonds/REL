  "problem": "Three friends are driving to New York City and splitting the gas cost equally. At the last minute, 2 more friends joined the trip. The cost of gas was then evenly redistributed among all of the friends. The cost for each of the original 3 decreased by $\\$$11.00. What was the total cost of the gas, in dollars?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, reflecting along the way to ensure our approach is effective. We'll start by understanding the scenario, brainstorming different strategies, solving the problem, and verifying our solution to make sure everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, so we have a group of friends splitting the gas costs. Initially, there are three friends, but then two more join, making it five in total. Because of this change, the cost per person decreases by \\$11.00 for each of the original three.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Total Cost of Gas:** We need to figure out the total gas cost.\n- **Cost Redistribution:** The cost was evenly split before and after the two additional friends joined.\n- **Decrease in Cost:** Each of the original three saved \\$11.00 after the re-distribution.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Set Up Equations:** Create equations representing the cost per person before and after.\n2. **Think in Terms of Total Savings:** Calculate the total savings for the original three.\n3. **Use Ratios:** Consider the ratio of costs before and after the change.\n\n**Wait, What's the Best Approach?**\n\nActually, setting up equations seems like a straightforward method. Let's start there, but I'm open to adjusting if it doesn't work out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n---\n\n**Exploring Strategy 1: Setting Up Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Before the Change:** The total cost was split among 3 friends.\n- **After the Change:** The total cost was split among 5 friends.\n- **Difference in Cost:** Each of the original three saved \\$11.00.\n\n**Possible Equation Setup:**\n\nLet\u2019s assign variables to make it clearer.\n\n- Let \\( T \\) be the total cost of gas.\n- Before the change, each of the 3 friends paid \\( \\frac{T}{3} \\).\n- After the change, each of the 5 friends paid \\( \\frac{T}{5} \\).\n- The decrease in cost per original friend is \\( \\frac{T}{3} - \\frac{T}{5} = \\$11.00 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this seems to make sense. By setting up the difference in cost, we can potentially solve for \\( T \\).\n\n---\n\n**Exploring Strategy 2: Thinking in Terms of Total Savings**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Total Savings for Original Three:** Each saved \\$11.00, so total savings = \\$33.00.\n- **This savings comes from the additional two friends contributing.**\n\n**Alternative Equation:**\n\nThe amount the additional two friends paid should account for this total savings.\n\nBut wait, this might complicate things since the total savings might not directly equal what the additional friends paid due to the redistribution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nActually, this approach might not be as straightforward. Let's stick with the first strategy for now.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Proceeding with Strategy 1 (Setting Up Equations)**\n\n---\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\nFrom Strategy 1:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T}{3} - \\frac{T}{5} = \\$11.00\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n\nLet's find a common denominator to simplify:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5T}{15} - \\frac{3T}{15} = \\$11.00 \\\\\n\\frac{2T}{15} = \\$11.00\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( T \\):**\n\nMultiply both sides by 15 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n\\[\n2T = 11.00 \\times 15 \\\\\n2T = 165\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{165}{2} = 82.50\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute, let\u2019s double-check this. If the total cost is \\$82.50, does it make sense with the given conditions?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n---\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Before the Change:** Each of the 3 paid \\(\\frac{82.50}{3} = \\$27.50\\)\n- **After the Change:** Each of the 5 paid \\(\\frac{82.50}{5} = \\$16.50\\)\n- **Decrease in Cost:** \\$27.50 - \\$16.50 = \\$11.00\n\n**Does It Match?**\n\nYes, the decrease is exactly \\$11.00 per original friend, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGreat! The calculation checks out. It seems that our initial approach was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\n---\n\n**Wait, Maybe There's Another Way to Confirm**\n\nEven though our first strategy worked, it's always good to have a backup method to ensure correctness.\n\n**Strategy 2 Revisited:**\n\nLet\u2019s briefly revisit thinking in terms of total savings:\n\n- **Total Savings for Original Three:** \\$11.00 each, so \\$33.00 total.\n- **The additional two friends' contribution must cover this \\$33.00 savings.**\n\n**Calculating Contribution per Additional Friend:**\n\n- Total cost after the change: \\$82.50\n- Each of the 5 paid: \\$16.50\n- So, each of the additional two friends paid: \\$16.50\n\n**Total Contribution of Additional Friends:**\n\n\\[\n\\$16.50 \\times 2 = \\$33.00\n\\]\n\n**Does This Align?**\n\nYes, the total contribution from the additional friends exactly matches the total savings for the original three.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis alternative check confirms that our initial solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Answer**\n\n---\n\n**<ANSWER> solution**\n\nThe total cost of the gas was **\\$82.50**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap and Final Thoughts**\n\n---\n\n**Recap of the Process:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Identified that the cost redistribution led to savings per original friend.\n2. **Brainstorming Strategies:** Considered setting up equations and thinking in terms of total savings.\n3. **Choosing the Best Approach:** Started with setting up equations as it seemed straightforward.\n4. **Solving the Equation:** Calculated the total cost using the difference in cost per original friend.\n5. **Verifying the Solution:** Performed a quick check to ensure the calculations made sense.\n6. **Alternative Confirmation:** Used another strategy to validate the solution.\n7. **Final Answer:** Confirmed that the total cost was \\$82.50.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nBy exploring different strategies and verifying the solution through multiple methods, we ensured the accuracy of our answer. It's always beneficial to have a primary approach and a backup to cross-verify, enhancing the reliability of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Concluding Thoughts**\n\nThrough this step-by-step exploration, we not only arrived at the correct answer but also reinforced the importance of verifying solutions using multiple strategies. This approach ensures that our solution is robust and error-free.",
  "ground_truth": "Suppose the total cost is $x$ dollars.  Then we have that the cost for each the original 3 friends was $\\frac{x}{3}$, while after the 2 extra friends joined, the cost was $\\frac{x}{5}$ per person.  So the given information translates into $\\frac{x}{3} - 11.00 = \\frac{x}{5}$.  Solving for $x$, find: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x}{3}-11&=\\frac{x}{5}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{x}{3}-\\frac{x}{5}&=11\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{5x-3x}{15}&=11\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{15}{2}\\cdot11=\\boxed{82.50}\n\\end{align*}"
