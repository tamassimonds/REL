    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like how I would approach it if I were working on it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, my brain jumps to a few initial ideas:\n\n1. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Maybe I can rearrange the equation involving \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{y} \\) to find a relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n2. **Common Denominator:** Perhaps finding a common denominator could help simplify the equation.\n\n3. **Factoring:** The equation looks like it could be factored to find integer solutions.\n\n4. **Trial and Error with Positive Integers:** Since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers, maybe testing a few values would give me a hint.\n\nBut I also notice that:\n\n- **Algebraic Manipulation Might Lead to a Quadratic:** This could get messy, so I need to be careful.\n  \n- **Common Denominator is a Good Start:** It might simplify the equation right away.\n\n- **Factoring Could Work If I Rearrange Correctly:** This might lead me to a quadratic that can be factored.\n\n- **Trial and Error Could Work, But It Might Be Time-Consuming:** I should try to avoid guessing too much.\n\nOverall, I think starting with combining fractions using a common denominator is the most straightforward approach. If that doesn't lead me anywhere, I can consider factoring or testing integer values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Common Denominator**\n\nLet's start with the given equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\nTo combine the fractions on the left, I need a common denominator, which would be \\( xy \\). So, I can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y + x}{xy} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\n**What I'm Thinking:**\n\n- This simplifies to \\( y + x = \\frac{xy}{12} \\).\n- Now, I can multiply both sides by 12 to get rid of the fraction.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n12(y + x) = xy\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n12x + 12y = xy\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This looks like a quadratic equation in disguise.\n- I can rearrange it to standard quadratic form by moving all terms to one side.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n\\[\nxy - 12x - 12y = 0\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Factoring the Quadratic Equation**\n\nNow, I see that the equation is:\n\n\\[\nxy - 12x - 12y = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This reminds me of quadratic equations that can be factored.\n- I can try to factor this into a product of two binomials.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\nxy - 12x - 12y + 144 = 144\n\\]\n\n**Wait, That Doesn't Seem Right:**\n\nHmm, my initial thought was to add 144 to both sides to make it easier to factor, but let me think if this is the right path. Adding 144 changes the original equation. Maybe I should stick to factoring without adding constants.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nPerhaps I can factor directly:\n\n\\[\nxy - 12x - 12y = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring by grouping might work, but it's not straightforward. Let me think... Maybe I can look for integer solutions that satisfy this equation.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nI remember that since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers, factoring might lead me to specific integer pairs.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nLet's set up the equation to find integer solutions:\n\n\\[\nxy = 12x + 12y\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{xy}{12} = x + y\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that \\( x + y \\) must be a multiple of \\( \\frac{xy}{12} \\).\n\n**Checking Validity:**\n\nBut wait, this might not directly help in finding the smallest \\( x + y \\). Perhaps I need another approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Integer Solutions**\n\nSince \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers, let's consider possible integer pairs that satisfy the original equation.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- The equation \\( xy = 12(x + y) \\) suggests that the product \\( xy \\) is twelve times their sum.\n- This indicates a relationship where both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) need to be factors of each other in a specific way.\n\n**Exploring Sample Values:**\n\nLet's test some small integer pairs to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\n**Testing \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = 4 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{7}{12} \\neq \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This pair doesn't satisfy the equation. But maybe it's just a coincidence.\n\n**Trying \\( x = 6 \\) and \\( y = 4 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{5}{12} \\neq \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\n**Checking \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = 6 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\neq \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- None of these pairs work. It's possible that the relationship is subtler than just testing small integers.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nPerhaps I need to look for a systematic way to find integer solutions rather than randomly testing pairs.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nConsider using the quadratic equation approach again, but let's do it carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Revisiting the Quadratic Equation**\n\nGoing back to the factored form:\n\n\\[\nx y - 12x - 12y = 0\n\\]\n\nLet's see if we can set it up as a quadratic equation in one variable.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If I consider \\( y \\) as a function of \\( x \\), or vice versa, I can set up a quadratic equation.\n- This might help in finding integer solutions.\n\n**Setting \\( y \\) in Terms of \\( x \\):**\n\nFrom the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( xy \\):\n\n\\[\ny + x = \\frac{xy}{12}\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\nxy - 12x - 12y = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( y \\) in Terms of \\( x \\):**\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to:\n\n\\[\ny(x - 12) = 12x\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{12x}{x - 12}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This gives me \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\).\n- To find integer solutions, \\( \\frac{12x}{x - 12} \\) must be an integer, meaning \\( x - 12 \\) must divide \\( 12x \\).\n\n**Checking Divisibility:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12x}{x - 12} = 12 + \\frac144}{x - 12}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( y \\) to be an integer, \\( \\frac{144}{x - 12} \\) must also be an integer. This implies that \\( x - 12 \\) is a divisor of \\( 144 \\).\n\n**Divisors of 144:**\n\nThe divisors of \\( 144 \\) are:\n\n\\[\n\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 8, \\pm 9, \\pm 12, \\pm 16, \\pm 18, \\pm 24, \\pm 36, \\pm 48, \\pm 72, \\pm 144\n\\]\n\n**Since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are Positive Integers:**\n\nThe possible positive values for \\( x - 12 \\) are:\n\n\\[\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nx = 12 + d \\quad \\text{where } d \\text{ is a divisor of } 144\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nCalculate corresponding \\( y \\) values for each \\( d \\), and find \\( x + y \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) for Each Divisor**\n\nLet's list out the divisors of \\( 144 \\) and calculate corresponding \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) values.\n\n**Divisor \\( d = 1 \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = 12 + 1 = 13\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{12 \\times 13}{13 - 12} = \\frac{156}{1} = 156\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx + y = 13 + 156 = 169\n\\]\n\n**Divisor \\( d = 2 \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = 12 + 2 = 14\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{12 \\times 14}{14 - 12} = \\frac{168}{2} = 84\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx + y = 14 + 84 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Divisor \\( d = 3 \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = 12 + 3 = 15\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{12 \\times 15}{15 - 12} = \\frac{180}{3} = 60\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx + y = 15 + 60 = 75\n\\]\n\n**Divisor \\( d = 4 \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = 12 + 4 = 16\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{12 \\times 16}{16 - 12} = \\frac{192}{4} = 48\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx + y = 16 + 48 = 64\n\\]\n\n**Divisor \\( d = 6 \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = 12 + 6 = 18\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{12 \\times 18}{18 - 12} = \\frac{216}{6} = 36\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx + y = 18 + 36 = 54\n\\]\n\n**Keep Going with Higher Divisors:**\n\nLet's calculate a few more to see if the sum \\( x + y \\) can get smaller.\n\n**Divisor \\( d = 8 \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = 12 + 8 = 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{12 \\times 20}{20 - 12} = \\frac{240}{8} = 30\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx + y = 20 + 30 = 50\n\\]\n\n**Divisor \\( d = 9 \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = 12 + 9 = 21\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{12 \\times 21}{21 - 12} = \\frac{252}{9} = 28\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx + y = 21 + 28 = 49\n\\]\n\n**Divisor \\( d = 12 \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = 12 + 12 = 24\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{12 \\times 24}{24 - 12} = \\frac{288}{12} = 24\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx + y = 24 + 24 = 48\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are equal when \\( d = 12 \\). But the problem states \\( x \\neq y \\).\n- This means I can't use \\( d = 12 \\) because it leads to \\( x = y \\), which violates the condition \\( x \\neq y \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe smallest value of \\( x + y \\) among the valid divisors is **48**, but since \\( x = y \\) at this point, it doesn't satisfy the problem's condition. Therefore, I need to consider the next smallest \\( x + y \\).\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nCheck the next smallest sum where \\( x \\neq y \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finding the Smallest Valid \\( x + y \\)**\n\nFrom the calculations:\n\n- **Divisor \\( d = 12 \\):** \\( x + y = 48 \\), but \\( x = y = 24 \\), so not valid.\n\n- **Divisor \\( d = 9 \\):** \\( x + y = 49 \\), and \\( x \\neq y \\) (\\( x = 21, y = 28 \\)), valid.\n\n- **Divisor \\( d = 8 \\):** \\( x + y = 50 \\), and \\( x \\neq y \\) (\\( x = 20, y = 30 \\)), valid.\n\n- **Divisor \\( d = 6 \\):** \\( x + y = 54 \\), and \\( x \\neq y \\) (\\( x = 18, y = 36 \\)), valid.\n\n- **Divisor \\( d = 4 \\):** \\( x + y = 64 \\), and \\( x \\neq y \\) (\\( x = 16, y = 48 \\)), valid.\n\n- **Divisor \\( d = 3 \\):** \\( x + y = 75 \\), and \\( x \\neq y \\) (\\( x = 15, y = 60 \\)), valid.\n\n- **Divisor \\( d = 2 \\):** \\( x + y = 98 \\), and \\( x \\neq y \\) (\\( x = 14, y = 84 \\)), valid.\n\n- **Divisor \\( d = 1 \\):** \\( x + y = 169 \\), and \\( x \\neq y \\) (\\( x = 13, y = 156 \\)), valid.\n\n**Check for the Smallest \\( x + y \\):**\n\nAmong these:\n\n- \\( x + y = 49 \\) when \\( d = 9 \\)\n  \nThis is the smallest possible sum that satisfies \\( x \\neq y \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The pair \\( (21, 28) \\) gives the smallest sum \\( x + y = 49 \\) while satisfying all conditions.\n  \n**Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{49}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**\n\n- **Condition \\( x \\neq y \\):** All selected pairs have \\( x \\neq y \\).\n\n- **Equation Satisfaction:** Each pair satisfies the original equation \\( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{12} \\).\n\n- **Smallest \\( x + y \\):** Among all valid pairs, \\( x + y = 49 \\) is the smallest.\n\n**Alternative Strategies Check:**\n\n- **Quadratic Factoring:** Led me to consider integer solutions through divisibility.\n\n- **Common Denominator:** Simplified the equation to a quadratic form.\n\n- **Integer Solutions Testing:** Validated the smallest sum through testing divisors.\n\n**Mistakes and Corrections:**\n\n- Initially attempted to factor by adding a constant, which led to confusion. Realizing that divisibility by \\( 144 \\) was the key insight.\n\n- Disregarded \\( d = 12 \\) as it resulted in \\( x = y \\), which wasn't allowed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe step-by-step exploration confirms that the smallest possible value for \\( x + y \\) is **49**.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough captures the thought process naturally, reflecting brainstorming, checking, and adjusting strategies along the way, much like how a human would approach and solve the problem.",
