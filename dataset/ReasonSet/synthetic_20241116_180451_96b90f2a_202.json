I'll approach it like I would if I were tackling it myself, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking for correctness, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn\u2019t seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**\"Find the product of all positive integer values of \\( c \\) such that \\( 8x^2 + 15x + c = 0 \\) has two real roots.\"**\n\nI think, \"Okay, this looks like a quadratic equation. To have two real roots, there must be certain conditions that \\( c \\) needs to satisfy.\" But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start right away. Quadratics and their roots usually involve the discriminant, but let me brainstorm a bit more.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Discriminant Approach:** \n   - I remember that for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\) determines the nature of the roots. If \\( \\Delta > 0 \\), there are two distinct real roots; if \\( \\Delta = 0 \\), there\u2019s one real root; and if \\( \\Delta < 0 \\), no real roots exist.\n   \n2. **Value of \\( c \\) Affected:** \n   - Since only \\( c \\) is variable here, perhaps I need to find values of \\( c \\) that make \\( \\Delta > 0 \\).\n\n3. **Integrality of \\( c \\):** \n   - The question specifies that \\( c \\) must be a positive integer, so I\u2019ll need to consider only positive integer values that satisfy the condition.\n\nAt this point, **the discriminant approach** seems the most straightforward. But let me jot down a few alternative strategies in case this doesn't pan out:\n\n- **Graphical Approach:** \n  - Plotting the quadratic and visually inspecting when it intersects the x-axis might help identify suitable \\( c \\) values.\n\n- **Completing the Square:** \n  - This method could help reframe the equation, but it feels a bit more cumbersome for finding specific \\( c \\) values.\n\n- **Numerical Testing:** \n  - Testing different \\( c \\) values to see if the equation has two real roots, but this might be inefficient.\n\nI think I\u2019ll start with the **Discriminant Approach** because it\u2019s a well-established method for determining the nature of roots in quadratics. If this doesn't work, I can explore other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Discriminant Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant for the given quadratic equation to see which values of \\( c \\) ensure \\( \\Delta > 0 \\).\n\nThe quadratic is:  \n\\[ 8x^2 + 15x + c = 0 \\]\n\n**Formula for Discriminant:**\n\n\\[ \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\]\n\nHere,  \n- \\( a = 8 \\)  \n- \\( b = 15 \\)  \n- \\( c = \\) (variable)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[ \\Delta = 15^2 - 4 \\times 8 \\times c \\]  \n\\[ \\Delta = 225 - 32c \\]\n\n**Check: Is \\( \\Delta > 0 \\)?**\n\nTo find the range of \\( c \\) values that make \\( \\Delta > 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 225 - 32c > 0 \\]  \n\\[ 225 > 32c \\]  \n\\[ c < \\frac{225}{32} \\]  \n\\[ c < 7.03125 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, the inequality tells me that \\( c \\) must be less than \\( 7.03125 \\). Since \\( c \\) must be a positive integer, the possible values of \\( c \\) are:  \n\\[ c = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \\]\n\nThis makes sense because all these integers are less than \\( 7.03125 \\) and are positive. \n\nBut let me **double-check** by considering the upper limit:\n\n- If \\( c = 7 \\):\n  \\[ \\Delta = 225 - 32 \\times 7 = 225 - 224 = 1 \\]  \n  (which is greater than 0, so \\( c = 7 \\) works)\n\n- If \\( c = 8 \\):\n  \\[ \\Delta = 225 - 32 \\times 8 = 225 - 256 = -31 \\]  \n  (which is less than 0, so \\( c = 8 \\) doesn't work)\n\nSo, the range is indeed \\( 1 \\leq c \\leq 7 \\).\n\n**Intermediate Check:**\n\nDoes this seem correct? Yes, because all these values satisfy \\( \\Delta > 0 \\), ensuring two real roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Product of All Valid \\( c \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I know the positive integer values of \\( c \\) that work are \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \\) and \\( 7 \\), I need to find the product of these numbers.\n\nThis part is straightforward, but let me think about the best way to calculate it.\n\n**Strategies:**\n\n1. **Simple Multiplication:** \n   - Multiply all the integers directly.\n\n2. **Use of Factorials:** \n   - Recognize that the product of the first \\( n \\) integers is \\( n! \\). Here, \\( n = 7 \\), so \\( 7! \\) could be useful.\n\n3. **Pairwise Multiplication:** \n   - Multiply numbers in pairs to make the calculations easier.\n\nI think I'll go with the **Simple Multiplication** method to keep it simple, but I\u2019ll also consider using \\( 7! \\) for verification.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nMultiplying the integers:\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 2 = 2 \\]  \n\\[ 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\]  \n\\[ 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\]  \n\\[ 24 \\times 5 = 120 \\]  \n\\[ 120 \\times 6 = 720 \\]  \n\\[ 720 \\times 7 = 5040 \\]  \n\nSo, the product is **5040**.\n\n**Verification Using Factorials:**\n\nLet\u2019s check this using the factorial approach:\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 7! = 5040 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth methods give the same result, **5040**, so I\u2019m confident that the product is correct.\n\n**Intermediate Check:**\n\nDoes the final product make sense? Given that all \\( c \\) values are positive integers and their product has been calculated correctly, it seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Reassessing the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me **reevaluate** whether the discriminant approach was indeed the best starting point and if there's anything I might have missed.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** \n  - I briefly thought about using a graphical approach or completing the square, but the discriminant method was straightforward and effective for this problem.\n\n- **Possibility of Negative or Zero \\( c \\):** \n  - The question specifies positive integers, so I ensured only those values were considered.\n\n- **Checking Edge Cases:** \n  - I tested \\( c = 7 \\) to confirm it works and \\( c = 8 \\) to ensure it doesn't. This reassures that the discriminant condition is correctly applied.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything seems to align. The discriminant approach provided the correct range for \\( c \\), and the product calculation was straightforward. No need to adjust the strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nAfter thoroughly exploring different strategies, applying the discriminant method, and verifying each step, the **product of all positive integer values of \\( c \\)** such that \\( 8x^2 + 15x + c = 0 \\) has two real roots is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5040}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- By starting with the most direct method\u2014the discriminant\u2014I was able to efficiently determine the range of \\( c \\) values.\n- Throughout the process, checking and verifying each step ensured the correctness of the approach and the final product.\n- Reflecting often helped catch any potential missteps early, maintaining confidence in the solution.",
