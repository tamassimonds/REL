The denominators are powers of 2, which is familiar. The numerators are sequential integers, \\( k \\), which adds a layer of complexity.\n\nI remember dealing with similar series where terms involve \\( k \\) in both the numerator and denominator, like the series for \\( e^x \\) or Taylor expansions. But unlike those, this series doesn't seem to be related to exponential functions directly since it involves integer multiples in the numerators.\n\nI'm brainstorming a few strategies:\n\n1. **Geometric Series Approach:** Maybe I can relate it to a geometric series by factoring out terms, but the \\( k \\) in the numerator throws me off.\n   \n2. **Power Series Expansion:** This looks somewhat like a power series, which makes me think about Taylor or Maclaurin series expansions. Perhaps there's a function whose series this represents.\n\n3. **Summation Manipulation:** Perhaps manipulating the series term by term or using known summation formulas could help.\n\n4. **Generating Functions:** This is a more advanced technique. Using generating functions might simplify the evaluation.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m a bit unsure where to start. The presence of \\( k \\) in both the numerator and denominator makes it different from straightforward geometric or arithmetic series. I\u2019ll jot down what comes to mind and see which path seems more promising.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies:**\n\n**Strategy 1: Geometric Series Approach**\n\n- **Thought:** Geometric series have a common ratio and are simpler to sum. However, my series has \\( k \\) in the numerator, which is uncommon for standard geometric series.\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, geometric series typically involve constant multipliers (e.g., \\( r^k \\)). Here, we have \\( k/2^k \\), so it\u2019s not a straightforward geometric series. Maybe this approach isn\u2019t the best.\n\n**Strategy 2: Power Series Expansion**\n\n- **Thought:** Power series like the Taylor or Maclaurin series represent functions as infinite sums of terms. Perhaps there\u2019s a function whose series expansion matches this.\n\n- **Reflection:** This sounds promising because power series can handle terms with \\( k \\) in the exponent. Let me explore this further.\n\n**Strategy 3: Summation Manipulation**\n\n- **Thought:** I could try manipulating the series by factoring or using known summation formulas. Perhaps separating the terms or finding a pattern might help.\n\n- **Reflection:** This could work, but summation manipulations can get tricky, especially with \\( k \\) in both the numerator and denominator.\n\n**Strategy 4: Generating Functions**\n\n- **Thought:** Generating functions are powerful tools in combinatorics for summing series. Maybe I can express this series as a generating function.\n\n- **Reflection:** This is more advanced and might be overkill for this problem. However, if other methods don\u2019t pan out, it\u2019s worth considering.\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 2: Power Series Expansion**\n\nGiven that geometric series aren\u2019t fitting well and generating functions might be too complex, I\u2019ll delve into power series expansions. This aligns with how series are evaluated for functions like \\( e^x \\).\n\n**Step 1:** **Consider the Function \\( e^x \\)**\n\n- Recall that the Maclaurin series for \\( e^x \\) is:\n\n  \\[\n  e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}\n  \\]\n\n- **Connection:** In my series, the denominators are powers of 2, and the numerators are multiples of \\( k \\). This makes me think about differentiating the series for \\( e^x \\) to introduce the \\( k \\) term.\n\n**Step 2:** **Differentiate \\( e^x \\) Series**\n\n- If I differentiate the series term by term, I bring down the exponent, which gives me \\( n \\) in the numerator.\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{n x^{n-1}}{n!}\n  \\]\n\n- **Thought:** This introduces \\( n \\) in the numerator, but I need \\( n \\) to be multiplied by \\( x^n \\), which is like my series but with factorials in the denominator.\n\n**Step 3:** **Adjust the Series**\n\n- To match my series, I need to adjust the terms. Notice that my series has \\( \\frac{k}{2^k} \\), so I can set \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) to connect it with the series for \\( e^x \\).\n\n- However, I still have \\( k \\) in the numerator and \\( 2^k \\) in the denominator, which isn't directly in the form of \\( e^x \\).\n\n**Step 4:** **Re-examine the Approach**\n\n- **Reflection:** This isn't directly yielding the desired form. Perhaps differentiating the series for \\( e^x \\) isn't the right path.\n\n- **Realization:** Wait, differentiating introduces \\( k \\) but doesn't align with \\( 2^k \\) denominators. Maybe I need a different function whose series matches my sum.\n\n**Strategy Re-evaluation:**\n\nAt this point, differentiating the \\( e^x \\) series isn't leading me to the solution. I realize that I need to explore another function whose series expansion better matches my sum.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Summation Manipulation**\n\n**Step 1:** **Rewrite the Series**\n\n- Let's start by rewriting the series to see if a pattern emerges:\n\n  \\[\n  S = \\frac{1}{2^1} + \\frac{2}{2^2} + \\frac{3}{2^3} + \\cdots = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k}{2^k}\n  \\]\n\n- **Thought:** Maybe I can find a relationship or a known formula for this type of series.\n\n**Step 2:** **Consider Known Summation Formulas**\n\n- I recall that there are formulas for summing series like \\( \\sum kx^k \\). Specifically:\n\n  \\[\n  \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} kx^k = \\frac{x}{(1-x)^2} \\quad \\text{for } |x| < 1\n  \\]\n\n- **Connection:** This formula is very similar to my series. If I set \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\), it aligns perfectly.\n\n**Step 3:** **Apply the Formula**\n\n- Substitute \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) into the formula:\n\n  \\[\n  \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 2\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This gives me a sum of 2, which seems straightforward and matches the expected result based on known summations.\n\n### **Checking the Work:**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does the Value Make Sense?** The series converges, and the formula applied is valid for \\( |x| < 1 \\). Setting \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) falls within this range.\n\n- **Formula Application:** The steps follow logically\u2014substituting \\( x \\), calculating the denominator, and simplifying the fraction.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\n\n- **Is the Approach Correct?** Yes, the summation formula for \\( \\sum kx^k \\) is well-established, and applying it with \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) fits the series perfectly.\n\n- **Alternative Verification:** I could consider breaking down the series into parts or using generating functions, but the direct application of the formula is straightforward and correct.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k}{2^k} = 2\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, I found that leveraging the known summation formula \\( \\sum kx^k = \\frac{x}{(1-x)^2} \\) was the most effective approach. Initially, considering power series expansions led to confusion, but recognizing the similarity to a standard summation formula clarified the path forward. Checking the work ensured the correctness of the solution, and the final answer aligns with expected results for such series.\n\nThroughout the process, brainstorming different methods, reflecting on their applicability, and verifying each step ensured a thorough and accurate evaluation of the sum.",
