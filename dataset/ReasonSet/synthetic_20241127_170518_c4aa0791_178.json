  "problem": "When the product $(3x+2y+1)(x+4y+5)$ is expanded, what is the sum of the coefficients of the terms which contain a nonzero power of $y$?",
  "solution": "### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- We need to expand the product \\((3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5)\\).\n- After expanding, we'll find the sum of the coefficients of terms containing a nonzero power of \\(y\\), like \\(y^1, y^2,\\) etc.\n- This feels like a typical polynomial expansion problem\u2014perhaps using the distributive property or an extended version of the FOIL method.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n- **Option 1:** Use the distributive property to expand step by step.\n- **Option 2:** Apply the FOIL method, although each expression has more than two terms.\n- **Option 3:** Identify which terms will contain \\(y\\) before expanding to save time.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUsing the distributive property might be straightforward but could get messy. Identifying \\(y\\) terms first could be more efficient. However, to ensure all terms are accounted for, starting with the distributive approach seems safest.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming Different Approaches\n\n**Initial Approach:**\n\n- Begin by expanding using the distributive property: multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\n- Consider identifying which multiplications will result in \\(y\\) terms to streamline the process.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- To avoid missing any terms, proceed with the full expansion first and then extract the necessary coefficients.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Expanding the Expression\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Distribute each term in \\((3x + 2y + 1)\\) across each term in \\((x + 4y + 5)\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Multiply \\(3x\\) by each term in the second bracket:**\n   - \\(3x \\cdot x = 3x^2\\)\n   - \\(3x \\cdot 4y = 12xy\\)\n   - \\(3x \\cdot 5 = 15x\\)\n   \n   **Result:** \\(3x^2 + 12xy + 15x\\)\n\n2. **Multiply \\(2y\\) by each term in the second bracket:**\n   - \\(2y \\cdot x = 2xy\\)\n   - \\(2y \\cdot 4y = 8y^2\\)\n   - \\(2y \\cdot 5 = 10y\\)\n   \n   **Result:** \\(2xy + 8y^2 + 10y\\)\n\n3. **Multiply \\(1\\) by each term in the second bracket:**\n   - \\(1 \\cdot x = x\\)\n   - \\(1 \\cdot 4y = 4y\\)\n   - \\(1 \\cdot 5 = 5\\)\n   \n   **Result:** \\(x + 4y + 5\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Each term was multiplied correctly. No issues so far.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Combining All Terms\n\n**Listing All Terms:**\n\n- Combine the results from each multiplication step:\n  \\[\n  3x^2 + 12xy + 15x + 2xy + 8y^2 + 10y + x + 4y + 5\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Next, combine like terms to simplify the expression, focusing especially on terms involving \\(y\\).\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\n- Combining \\(y\\) terms during expansion could have saved time, but listing them ensures accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Combining Like Terms\n\n**Combining \\(x\\) Terms:**\n\n- \\(3x^2\\)\n- \\(15x + x = 16x\\)\n\n**Combining \\(xy\\) Terms:**\n\n- \\(12xy + 2xy = 14xy\\)\n\n**Combining \\(y\\) Terms:**\n\n- \\(10y + 4y = 14y\\)\n\n**Constant Term:**\n\n- \\(5\\)\n\n**Final Expanded Expression:**\n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 14xy + 16x + 8y^2 + 14y + 5\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- All like terms are combined correctly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The expansion seems correct; no terms are missing.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Identifying Coefficients of \\(y\\) Terms\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Focus on terms containing a nonzero power of \\(y\\):\n\n  - \\(14xy\\): Coefficient is \\(14\\)\n  - \\(8y^2\\): Coefficient is \\(8\\)\n  - \\(14y\\): Coefficient is \\(14\\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- No other \\(y\\) terms are present.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- It's straightforward\u2014just need to sum these coefficients.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Sum of Coefficients\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n14 + 8 + 14 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- \\(14 + 8 = 22\\)\n- \\(22 + 14 = 36\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The calculation is simple and correct. Double-checking helps avoid small arithmetic errors.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer: Conclusion\n\n**<ANSWER>solution</ANSWER>:**\n\n- **The sum of the coefficients of the terms which contain a nonzero power of \\(y\\) is \\(36\\).**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- By carefully expanding the expression and combining like terms, all \\(y\\) coefficients were correctly identified and summed.\n- Reflecting at each step ensured that no errors were made, leading to an accurate solution.\n\n---\n\n### Final Reflection and Verification\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Before finalizing, ensure that all steps were correctly followed and no terms were overlooked.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- Re-examining each multiplication step confirms that all \\(y\\) terms were accurately accounted for.\n- No coefficients were left out during the summation.\n\n**<ANSWER>solution</ANSWER>:**\n\n- **The sum of the coefficients of the terms which contain a nonzero power of \\(y\\) is \\(36\\).**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- By systematically expanding the expression and carefully combining like terms, the solution was arrived at accurately.\n- Reflecting and verifying at each step ensured that no errors were made, leading to a confident and correct final answer.\n\n**Overall Reflection:**\n\n- Expanding step by step ensured accuracy, although it was time-consuming.\n- Identifying \\(y\\) terms early could have saved time but risked missing some coefficients.\n- Taking a thorough approach helped verify the correctness of the solution.\n\nBy following a structured problem-solving process, we ensured that all necessary components were considered, leading to a reliable and accurate final answer.",
