    "working_out": "Sure, let's dive into this problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming as we go to ensure a thorough understanding and correct solution. I\u2019ll write out my thought process just like I would if I were solving it manually, including exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The problem involves a trip from Carville to Nikpath that takes **4\u00bd hours** at an **average speed of 70 miles per hour**.\n- I need to find out how many hours the trip requires when traveling at an **average speed of 60 miles per hour**, expressed as a **decimal to the nearest hundredth**.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- This reminds me of problems where I need to relate time, distance, and speed. I\u2019ve seen similar questions before, where changing the speed affects the travel time.\n- I think I need to calculate the **distance** first since that seems like a logical starting point. Knowing the distance would help me determine how long it takes at the new speed.\n- Another approach could be to use the concept of **proportions**, considering that time and speed are inversely related for a constant distance.\n- I\u2019m not entirely sure which method is best, so I\u2019ll explore both starting with calculating the distance.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Distance**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since speed is distance over time, I can rearrange this formula to find the distance traveled.\n- Given: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Time} = 4\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ hours} = 4.5 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Speed} = 70 \\text{ miles per hour}\n  \\]\n- I\u2019ll use the formula: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 70 \\, \\text{miles/hour} \\times 4.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 315 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** \n  \\[\n  70 \\times 4.5 = 70 \\times (4 + 0.5) = 70 \\times 4 + 70 \\times 0.5 = 280 + 35 = 315\n  \\]\n- **Reflection:** \n  - The distance seems reasonable for a trip. Multiplying 70 by 4.5 gives 315, which sounds correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Distance:** 315 miles\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies to Find the New Time**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now that I know the distance is **315 miles**, I need to find the time it takes to travel this distance at **60 miles per hour**.\n- **Strategy 1:** Use the formula \\(\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\\).\n- **Strategy 2:** Use proportions to relate the times at different speeds, considering time and speed are inversely related.\n- **Strategy 3:** Since the speeds are both multiples of 10, perhaps simplifying the calculations by scaling could work.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- **Strategy 1** seems straightforward: plug the distance and new speed into the time formula.\n- **Strategy 2** might be overcomplicating things, but it could serve as a check to ensure consistency.\n- **Strategy 3** is appealing because scaling might simplify the arithmetic.\n\n**Deciding on Strategy:**\n- I\u2019ll start with **Strategy 1**, calculating directly using the formula. If it feels cumbersome or if I need to verify, I\u2019ll consider **Strategy 2** as a check.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying Strategy 1 \u2013 Direct Calculation Using the Formula**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{315 \\, \\text{miles}}{60 \\, \\text{miles/hour}} = 5.25 \\, \\text{hours}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{315}{60} = 5.25\n  \\]\n- **Reflection:**\n  - Dividing 315 by 60 gives 5.25 hours, which seems reasonable. It makes sense that traveling slower would take longer to cover the same distance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Time Required at 60 mph:** 5.25 hours\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution Using Strategy 2 \u2013 Proportions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To ensure the correctness, I\u2019ll use proportions. The relationship between speed and time is inverse, meaning:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Speed}_1}{\\text{Speed}_2} = \\frac{\\text{Time}_2}{\\text{Time}_1}\n  \\]\n- Given:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Speed}_1 = 70 \\, \\text{mph}, \\quad \\text{Time}_1 = 4.5 \\, \\text{hours}, \\quad \\text{Speed}_2 = 60 \\, \\text{mph}, \\quad \\text{Time}_2 = ?\n  \\]\n\n**Setting Up the Proportion:**\n\\[\n\\frac{70}{60} = \\frac{5.25}{4.5}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating:**\n\\[\n\\frac{70}{60} = \\frac{7}{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{5.25}{4.5} = \\frac{21}{18} = \\frac{7}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Both sides of the proportion are equal, confirming that the calculated time is consistent with the relationship between speed and time.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This verifies that our initial calculation was correct. The proportion check reinforces the validity of the result.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Time Required at 60 mph:** 5.25 hours (consistent with both methods)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection and Answer Formatting**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Having calculated the time using two different strategies and confirmed their consistency, I\u2019m confident in the solution.\n- I need to express the answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth, as specified.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5.25} \\, \\text{hours}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Decimal Formatting:**\n  - The time is already in decimal form to two decimal places (5.25), meeting the requirement.\n- **Reasonableness:**\n  - Comparing both speeds:\n    - Speed decreased from 70 mph to 60 mph, which aligns with an increase in travel time from 4.5 hours to 5.25 hours.\n    - The difference in time (5.25 - 4.5 = 0.75 hours) seems proportional to the change in speed.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- The approach was effective, starting with calculating the distance and then applying the time formula.\n- Proportions served as a useful verification tool, ensuring the correctness of the result.\n- Everything checks out, and the answer is formatted correctly as per the requirement.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5.25} \\, \\text{hours}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nBy exploring different strategies, checking the validity of each step, and reflecting on the correctness throughout, we ensure a robust and accurate solution to the problem. This methodical approach helps in naturally catching any potential missteps and confirming the final answer with confidence.",
