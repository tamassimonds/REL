  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through it just like I would if I were tackling it on paper\u2014brainstorming different strategies, checking my work along the way, and being open to changing directions if something doesn't feel right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the function \n\n\\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \\rfloor} \\)\n\nmy initial reaction is to think about the floor function, \\( \\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor \\). I remember that the floor function returns the greatest integer less than or equal to the input. So, immediately, I realize that the denominator needs to be a **non-zero integer** to keep \\( f(x) \\) defined. If the denominator is zero, the function is undefined.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Identify where the denominator is zero:** Find values of \\( x \\) that make \\( \\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \\rfloor = 0 \\), since those would make the function undefined.\n\n2. **Determine intervals where the denominator is positive or negative:** Since the floor function outputs integers, understanding where the expression inside the floor is close to zero could help.\n\n3. **Analyze the quadratic expression:** \\( x^2 - 7x + 13 \\) is a quadratic, so maybe I can find its roots or vertex to understand its behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards the first strategy\u2014finding where the denominator is zero\u2014because it directly tells me where the function is undefined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding Where the Denominator is Zero**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to solve \n\n\\( \\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \\rfloor = 0 \\). \n\nThis means that \\( x^2 - 7x + 13 \\) must lie in the interval \\([0, 1)\\), because the floor function rounds down to zero only within this range.\n\n**Wait, That Can't Be Right...**\n\nActually, let me think about this again. The floor function equals zero only when the input is between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). So, I need to find \\( x \\) such that:\n\n\\[ \n0 \\leq x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection: Does This Make Sense?**\n\nYes, this makes sense. By solving this inequality, I can find the range of \\( x \\) where the denominator is zero, and thus, the function is undefined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to solve:\n\n\\[ \n0 \\leq x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1 \n\\]\n\nI'll break this into two parts:\n\n1. \\( x^2 - 7x + 13 \\geq 0 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1 \\)\n\n**But Wait...**\n\nActually, since we're only interested in where the floor function equals zero, I only need to focus on the second inequality:\n\n\\[ \nx^2 - 7x + 13 < 1 \n\\]\n\n**Rewriting the Inequality:**\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\[ \nx^2 - 7x + 12 < 0 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection: Does This Look Familiar?**\n\nThis is a quadratic inequality. I remember that to solve it, I need to find the roots of the corresponding equation and then determine where the quadratic is negative.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Roots of the Quadratic**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's solve:\n\n\\[ \nx^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \n\\]\n\nI'll use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \n\\]\n\nWhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -7 \\), and \\( c = 12 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(12) = 49 - 48 = 1 \n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2} = \\frac{7 \\pm 1}{2} \n\\]\n\nSo, the roots are:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{7 + 1}{2} = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{7 - 1}{2} = 3 \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 7x + 12 = (x - 3)(x - 4) \n\\]\n\nThis factors correctly, so the roots are \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis tells me that the quadratic \\( x^2 - 7x + 12 \\) changes sign at \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determining Where the Quadratic is Negative**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe quadratic \\( x^2 - 7x + 12 \\) is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive). Therefore, the expression is negative between its roots.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\\[\n3 < x < 4 \n\\]\n\nSo, \\( x^2 - 7x + 12 < 0 \\) between \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis means that \\( f(x) \\) is undefined for \\( 3 < x < 4 \\) because, in this interval, \\( \\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \\rfloor = 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determining the Domain of \\( f(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I know \\( f(x) \\) is undefined for \\( 3 < x < 4 \\), the domain will include all other real numbers.\n\n**But Wait...**\n\nI need to consider whether \\( f(x) \\) is defined at \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n**Checking \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\):**\n\n- At \\( x = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 7x + 13 = 9 - 21 + 13 = 1 \n\\]\n\\[\n\\lfloor 1 \\rfloor = 1 \n\\]\n\\[\nf(3) = \\frac{1}{1} = 1 \n\\]\n\n- At \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 7x + 13 = 16 - 28 + 13 = 1 \n\\]\n\\[\n\\lfloor 1 \\rfloor = 1 \n\\]\n\\[\nf(4) = \\frac{1}{1} = 1 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, \\( f(x) \\) is defined at both \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\). The only interval where \\( f(x) \\) is undefined is \\( 3 < x < 4 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Writing the Domain**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe domain of \\( f(x) \\) includes all real numbers except the open interval \\( 3 < x < 4 \\). In interval notation, this is:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, 3] \\cup [4, \\infty) \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis representation makes sense because it includes all \\( x \\) less than or equal to 3 and all \\( x \\) greater than or equal to 4.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- For \\( x \\leq 3 \\) and \\( x \\geq 4 \\), \\( f(x) \\) is defined.\n- The only problematic interval is \\( 3 < x < 4 \\), where the denominator becomes zero.\n\n**Deep Reflection:**\n\nEverything aligns with the initial analysis. The domain excludes the interval where the denominator is zero, and \\( f(x) \\) is well-defined elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n\\[\n\\text{The domain of } f(x) \\text{ is } (-\\infty, 3] \\cup [4, \\infty).\n\\]\n\n\n<ANSWER>solution\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The domain of } f(x) \\text{ is } (-\\infty, 3] \\cup [4, \\infty).}\n\\]\n</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The discriminant of the quadratic is $7^2-4(13)=-3<0$, so the quadratic has no real roots and is always positive for real inputs.  The function is undefined if $0\\leq x^2-7x+13<1$, since $\\lfloor x^2-7x+13 \\rfloor = 0$ in that case. Since the quadratic is always positive, we consider the inequality $x^2-7x+13<1$.\n\nTo find when $x^2-7x+13=1$, subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $x^2-7x+12=0$ and factor as $(x-3)(x-4)=0$, so $x=3$ or $x=4$.  The parabola $x^2-7x+12$ is negative between these points, so we must exclude the interval $(3,4)$ from the domain. So the domain of $f$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,3] \\cup [4,\\infty)}$."
