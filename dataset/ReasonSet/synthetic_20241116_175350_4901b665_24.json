    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, mimicking a human-like thought process with brainstorming, reflections, and checking along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n- **Understanding the Prompt:** We're looking for the **$y$-coordinate** of a point on the **$y$-axis** that is **equidistant** from points \\( A(-2, 0) \\) and \\( B(-1, 4) \\).\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** \n  - This reminds me of finding points that are equidistant from two given points \u2014 something related to the **perpendicular bisector** comes to mind.\n  - Alternatively, I could consider using the **distance formula** to set up an equation since distances from both points must be equal.\n  - Also, since the point lies on the **$y$-axis**, its **$x$-coordinate** is always **0**. This simplifies things a bit.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:**\n  1. **Using the Perpendicular Bisector:** Find the midpoint of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) and determine the equation of the line perpendicular to the segment \\( AB \\). Since the point lies on the \\( y \\)-axis, substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into this equation.\n  2. **Applying the Distance Formula:** Set the distance from the point on the \\( y \\)-axis to \\( A \\) equal to the distance to \\( B \\).\n  3. **Geometric Visualization:** Visualizing the problem might help to confirm the strategy or catch any missteps.\n\n- **Deciding on an Approach:** \n  - The **Perpendicular Bisector** method seems straightforward because it directly relates to points being equidistant.\n  - The **Distance Formula** approach is also valid but might involve more calculations.\n  - Let's start with the **Perpendicular Bisector** method and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Midpoint of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the point that is equidistant from both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), the first step is to determine the **midpoint** \\( M \\) of the segment \\( AB \\).\n- The midpoint formula is the average of the \\( x \\)-coordinates and the \\( y \\)-coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nM = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{-2 + (-1)}{2}, \\frac{0 + 4}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nM = \\left( \\frac{-3}{2}, \\frac{4}{2} \\right) = \\left( -\\frac{3}{2}, 2 \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** The midpoint calculation seems correct: \n  - \\( x \\)-coordinate: \\( \\frac{-3}{2} = -1.5 \\)\n  - \\( y \\)-coordinate: \\( \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\)\n\n- **Does this help?** Yes, knowing the midpoint is essential because the perpendicular bisector will pass through this point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Slope of Line \\( AB \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the **perpendicular bisector**, I need to know the slope of line \\( AB \\).\n- The slope \\( m \\) is calculated using the coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nm_{AB} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{4 - 0}{-1 - (-2)} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** The slope is **4**, which means the line \\( AB \\) rises steeply.\n\n- **Implication:** The perpendicular bisector will have a slope that is the **negative reciprocal** of \\( 4 \\), which is \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\). This makes sense because perpendicular lines have slopes that multiply to \\(-1\\).\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, this aligns with basic geometry principles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Writing the Equation of the Perpendicular Bisector**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I need to write the equation of the line that is the **perpendicular bisector** of \\( AB \\).\n- A line's equation can be written in slope-intercept form \\( y = mx + b \\), but since we're dealing with the \\( y \\)-axis (\\( x = 0 \\)), this might change how we apply it.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Using Point-Slope Form:** \n  - The equation of a line can also be \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\).\n  - Using the midpoint \\( M(-\\frac{3}{2}, 2) \\) and the slope \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\):\n\n\\[\ny - 2 = -\\frac{1}{4} \\left( x + \\frac{3}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n- **Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\ny - 2 = -\\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{3}{8} + 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{13}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** The equation seems correct. \n  - The slope is indeed \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\), and the \\( y \\)-intercept is \\( \\frac{13}{8} \\).\n  \n- **Does it align with expectations?** Yes, substituting \\( x = 0 \\) will directly give the \\( y \\)-coordinate we're looking for.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the \\( y \\)-Coordinate by Substituting \\( x = 0 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since the point we're interested in lies on the **$y$-axis**, its **$x$-coordinate** is **0**.\n- Substituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the perpendicular bisector's equation will yield the desired \\( y \\)-coordinate.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{4}(0) + \\frac{13}{8} = \\frac{13}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** The calculation is straightforward.\n  - Multiplying by zero nullifies the slope term, leaving \\( y = \\frac{13}{8} \\).\n\n- **Does this seem right?** \n  - Let\u2019s quickly verify:\n    - The point \\( (0, \\frac{13}{8}) \\) should be equidistant from both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n    - It lies on the \\( y \\)-axis, so the calculation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n- **Quick Check:** \n  - \\( \\frac{13}{8} \\) is **1.625**, which seems reasonable.\n  \n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution by Checking Distances**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To ensure accuracy, let\u2019s verify that the point \\( (0, \\frac{13}{8}) \\) is indeed equidistant from \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n- This acts as a **checkpoint** to confirm that our approach was correct.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Distance to \\( A(-2, 0) \\):**\n\n\\[\nd_A = \\sqrt{(0 - (-2))^2 + \\left( \\frac{13}{8} - 0 \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{(2)^2 + \\left( \\frac{13}{8} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + \\frac{169}{64}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{256}{64} + \\frac{169}{64}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{425}{64}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{425}}{8}\n\\]\n\n- **Distance to \\( B(-1, 4) \\):**\n\n\\[\nd_B = \\sqrt{(0 - (-1))^2 + \\left( \\frac{13}{8} - 4 \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{(1)^2 + \\left( \\frac{13}{8} - \\frac{32}{8} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\left( -\\frac{19}{8} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{361}{64}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{64} + \\frac{361}{64}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{425}{64}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{425}}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Both distances \\( d_A \\) and \\( d_B \\) are equal:\n  \\[\n  d_A = d_B = \\frac{\\sqrt{425}}{8}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Does this confirm the solution?** Yes, the distances are equal, verifying that the point \\( (0, \\frac{13}{8}) \\) is indeed equidistant from \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n- **Final Thought:** It's always good to double-check by plugging back into the original conditions. This ensures that every step was correctly executed and aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the step-by-step approach, the **$y$-coordinate** of the point on the **$y$-axis** that is equidistant from points \\( A(-2, 0) \\) and \\( B(-1, 4) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{13}{8}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by considering different strategies like the perpendicular bisector and distance formula.\n- **Perpendicular Bisector Method:** \n  - Calculated the midpoint of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n  - Determined the slope of \\( AB \\) and its negative reciprocal for the bisector.\n  - Wrote the equation of the bisector and solved for \\( y \\) at \\( x = 0 \\).\n- **Verification:** Checked distances from the bisector point to \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) to ensure equidistance.\n- **Reflection:** Throughout, constant checks ensured the correctness of each step, leading to a confident conclusion.\n\nThis approach not only provided the correct \\( y \\)-coordinate but also reinforced the validity of the solution through multiple reflections and verifications, mirroring a human's natural problem-solving process.",

  "ground_truth": "Because the point for which we are looking is on the $y$-axis, we know that it is of the form $(0,y)$. We apply the distance formula. The distance from A is  \\[\\sqrt{(-2-0)^2+(0-y)^2} = \\sqrt{y^2+4}\\]The distance from B is  \\[\\sqrt{(-1-0)^2 + (4-y)^2} = \\sqrt{y^2-8y+17}\\]Because the point is equidistant from $A$ and $B$, we set the two distances equal: $y^2-8y+17 = y^2 + 4$. Simplifying gives us $8y=13$, or $y = \\boxed{\\frac{13}{8}}$."
