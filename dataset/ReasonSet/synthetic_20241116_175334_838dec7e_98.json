    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I\u2019ll brainstorm a variety of strategies, reflect on whether they\u2019re working, check my progress frequently, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem gives me two functions:  \n\\[ f(x) = x^2 - 7x + 18 \\]  \n\\[ g(f(x)) = 2x + 3 \\]  \n\nI need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( g(8) \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Function Composition:** It looks like \\( g(f(x)) \\) is a composition of functions. Maybe I need to express \\( g(x) \\) in terms of \\( f(x) \\) first.\n- **Quadratic Equations:** Since \\( f(x) \\) is a quadratic, perhaps I can find its roots or vertex to simplify things.\n- **Solving for \\( x \\):** Since I need \\( g(8) \\), maybe setting \\( f(x) \\) equal to 8 could help.\n\nBut wait, before diving in, I should consider how \\( g(f(x)) = 2x + 3 \\) relates to \\( g(8) \\). Hmm, perhaps finding \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 8 \\) could be a starting point?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the First Strategy\u2014Finding \\( x \\) Where \\( f(x) = 8 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf I can find \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 8 \\), then \\( g(8) = g(f(x)) = 2x + 3 \\). This seems like a direct way to connect \\( g(8) \\) to \\( x \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nSet up the equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = 8 \\implies x^2 - 7x + 18 = 8\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 7x + 10 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Quadratic Equation:**\n\nWait, let me quickly verify if this quadratic can be factored easily or if I need to use the quadratic formula. Hmm, \\( 10 \\) factors into \\( 2 \\) and \\( 5 \\), which sum up to \\( -7 \\), so let's see if it factors:\n\n\\[\n(x - 5)(x - 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this factor correctly? Yes, \\( -5 + (-2) = -7 \\) and \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\). So, the roots are:\n\n\\[\nx = 5 \\text{ and } x = 2\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis tells me that \\( f(5) = 8 \\) and \\( f(2) = 8 \\). Thus, there are two possible values of \\( x \\) that satisfy \\( f(x) = 8 \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet me verify:\n\n\\[\nf(5) = 5^2 - 7 \\times 5 + 18 = 25 - 35 + 18 = 8 \\quad (\\text{Correct})\n\\]\n\\[\nf(2) = 2^2 - 7 \\times 2 + 18 = 4 - 14 + 18 = 8 \\quad (\\text{Correct})\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Value of \\( x \\) to Find \\( g(8) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\), I can use these to find \\( g(8) \\) since \\( g(8) = 2x + 3 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **For \\( x = 5 \\):**\n\n\\[\ng(8) = 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13\n\\]\n\n2. **For \\( x = 2 \\):**\n\n\\[\ng(8) = 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, does this make sense? I have two different values for \\( g(8) \\): \\( 13 \\) and \\( 7 \\). The question asks for the sum of all possible values of \\( g(8) \\), so I need to add these two together.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sum of all possible values of \\( g(8) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n13 + 7 = 20\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet me double-check each calculation:\n\n- For \\( x = 5 \\): \\( 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- For \\( x = 2 \\): \\( 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth calculations are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Reflecting on the Approach and Exploring Alternatives**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAt this point, I'm pretty confident that the initial strategy worked well. By finding the \\( x \\) values where \\( f(x) = 8 \\), I could directly compute \\( g(8) \\).\n\n**Alternative Strategies:**\n\n- **Solving for \\( g(y) \\):** Another approach could be to express \\( g(y) \\) in terms of \\( y \\) and then set \\( y = 8 \\). But since \\( g(f(x)) = 2x + 3 \\), and we already found \\( x \\) values, this seems unnecessary.\n- **Verifying with Inverses:** Maybe checking if \\( g \\) has an inverse could provide more insights, but again, it feels like overcomplicating things given the straightforward path we took.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe initial strategy was effective. Exploring other methods confirms that this is the correct and simplest approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe sum of all possible values of \\( g(8) \\) is **20**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nBy taking a step-by-step approach, checking each part of the process, and being open to exploring different strategies, I ensured that the solution was both correct and clear. It's always beneficial to reflect and verify, especially when multiple paths seem possible, to confirm the validity of the final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "We don't know $g(x)$, so we don't have an expression we can simply stick $8$ in to get an answer. We do, however, know that $g(f(x)) =2x +3$.  So, if we can figure out what to put into $f(x)$ such that $8$ is output, we can use our expression for $g(f(x))$ to find $g(8)$.\n\nIf $f(x) = 8$, then we have $x^2 -7x +18 = 8$, so $x^2 -7x +10 = 0$, so $(x-2)(x-5)=0$ which means $x=2$ or $x=5$.  Since $x$ could be $2$ or $5$, we could have $g(8) = g(f(2))$ or $g(8) = g(f(5))$.  Using the given expression for $g(f(x))$, the two possible values of $g(8)$ are  $g(f(2)) = 2\\cdot2 +3 = 7$ and $g(f(5)) = 2\\cdot5+3 = 13$.  The sum of these is $7+13=\\boxed{20}$."
