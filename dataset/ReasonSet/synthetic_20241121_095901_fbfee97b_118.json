  "problem": "Bob is trying to decide between two cell phone plans. Plan A has no flat fee, but the user must pay $10$ cents per minute on the phone. Plan B requires a one-time fee of $\\$20$, but only requires a payment of $5$ cents per minute on the phone. What is the minimum whole number of minutes Bob has to use the phone for to make Plan B the cheaper plan?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like how I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect along the way, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so **Bob** has two cell phone plans to choose from:\n\n- **Plan A:** No flat fee, but costs 10 cents per minute.\n- **Plan B:** A one-time fee of $20 and 5 cents per minute.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis looks like a classic cost comparison problem where I need to find out at what point (in minutes) Plan B becomes cheaper than Plan A. It reminds me of problems involving linear equations and break-even points.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to set it up yet. Let's brainstorm some strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Set Up Equations for Both Plans:**  \n   I could create cost equations for both plans based on the number of minutes used and find where Plan B's cost is less than Plan A's.\n\n2. **Graphical Approach:**  \n   Maybe plotting the costs on a graph to visually see where the two plans intersect could help.\n\n3. **Trial and Error:**  \n   Trying different numbers of minutes to see when Plan B becomes cheaper.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThe first strategy seems the most straightforward\u2014using equations. But the graphical approach could provide a visual confirmation. Trial and error might be time-consuming but useful for double-checking.\n\nI think I'll start with setting up equations. If that doesn't work, I'll consider the other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up Equations**\n\nLet's define:\n\n- \\( m \\) = number of minutes used.\n\n**Plan A Cost (\\( C_A \\)):**  \n\\[ C_A = 0.10m \\]  \n(Since it's 10 cents per minute with no flat fee.)\n\n**Plan B Cost (\\( C_B \\)):**  \n\\[ C_B = 20 + 0.05m \\]  \n($20 flat fee plus 5 cents per minute.)\n\n**Brainstorm:**  \nNow, I need to find the minimum whole number of minutes (\\( m \\)) where Plan B becomes cheaper than Plan A. So, I want to find \\( m \\) where \\( C_B < C_A \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Inequality**\n\nLet's set up the inequality:\n\n\\[ 20 + 0.05m < 0.10m \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks correct because I'm comparing the total costs of both plans. Now, I need to solve for \\( m \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Inequality**\n\n**First, isolate \\( m \\) by subtracting \\( 0.05m \\) from both sides:**\n\n\\[ 20 < 0.10m - 0.05m \\]  \n\\[ 20 < 0.05m \\]\n\n**Next, divide both sides by \\( 0.05 \\) to solve for \\( m \\):**\n\n\\[ m > \\frac{20}{0.05} \\]  \n\\[ m > 400 \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSo, \\( m \\) must be greater than 400. But since we need the **minimum whole number** of minutes, \\( m \\) should be 401.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet me plug \\( m = 401 \\) back into both cost equations to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Calculate \\( C_A \\) and \\( C_B \\) for \\( m = 401 \\):**\n\n- **Plan A:**  \n  \\[ C_A = 0.10 \\times 401 = \\$40.10 \\]\n\n- **Plan B:**  \n  \\[ C_B = 20 + (0.05 \\times 401) = 20 + 20.05 = \\$40.05 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAt 401 minutes, Plan B costs \\$40.05, which is cheaper than Plan A's \\$40.10. This confirms that \\( m = 401 \\) is indeed the minimum number of minutes where Plan B becomes cheaper.\n\n**Wait, did I consider everything?**  \nYes, I've accounted for both the flat fee and the per-minute charges. The inequality solved correctly, and the verification supports the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Graphical Method**\n\n**Just to Double-Check:**  \nLet's briefly consider the graphical approach. If I plotted both cost equations on a graph with minutes on the x-axis and cost on the y-axis, the point where the two lines intersect would be the break-even point. Plan B would be cheaper beyond this point.\n\nGiven our solution, the intersection should be at 400 minutes, and beyond that, Plan B is cheaper.\n\n**Does This Align with Our Solution?**  \nYes, it does. The graphical method supports our earlier calculation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Trial and Error**\n\n**Let\u2019s Test Around \\( m = 400 \\) and \\( m = 401 \\):**\n\n- **For \\( m = 400 \\):**\n\n  - **Plan A:**  \n    \\[ C_A = 0.10 \\times 400 = \\$40.00 \\]\n\n  - **Plan B:**  \n    \\[ C_B = 20 + (0.05 \\times 400) = 20 + 20 = \\$40.00 \\]\n\n  **Observation:**  \n  At 400 minutes, both plans cost the same. So, Plan B is not cheaper yet.\n\n- **For \\( m = 401 \\):**  \n  (As calculated earlier)\n\n  - **Plan A:** \\$40.10\n  - **Plan B:** \\$40.05\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPlan B becomes cheaper starting at 401 minutes. This confirms our solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**<ANSWER>401 minutes</ANSWER>**\n\n**Explanation:**  \nBob needs to use the phone for a minimum of 401 whole minutes for Plan B to become the cheaper option compared to Plan A.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap and Reflection**\n\n- **Brainstorming Different Strategies:**  \n  Initially considered setting up equations, graphical methods, and trial and error. Settled on equations as the primary method.\n\n- **Setting Up and Solving the Inequality:**  \n  Successfully formulated and solved the inequality to find \\( m > 400 \\).\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  Plugged the solution back into the cost equations to confirm correctness.\n\n- **Alternative Methods:**  \n  Briefly explored graphical and trial-and-error approaches to reinforce the solution.\n\n- **Final Check:**  \n  Ensured that at 401 minutes, Plan B is indeed cheaper than Plan A.\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nBy approaching the problem methodically, exploring multiple strategies, and verifying the solution, I've confidently determined that Bob should use at least **401 minutes** for Plan B to be more cost-effective.\n\n---\n\nThat's it! By thinking through each step like this, I ensured the solution was accurate and robust.",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of minutes that Bob anticipates using. Plan A costs $10x$ cents, while Plan B costs $2000 + 5x$ cents. We therefore have the inequality \\begin{align*}\n2000+5x &< 10x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2000 &< 5x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 400 &< x.\n\\end{align*} The smallest integer $x$ such that $400 < x$ is $401$. Therefore, Bob must use at least $\\boxed{401}$ minutes to make Plan B cheaper."
