    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll start off by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting along the way, checking if my approaches make sense, and adjusting as needed.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question about the probability of randomly selecting a double domino from a complete set, I think:\n\n- **Familiar Concept:** This reminds me of basic probability problems involving sets and favorable outcomes. I feel like I've dealt with similar problems before, maybe involving playing cards or dice.\n  \n- **Understanding Doubles:** A double domino has the same integer on both squares. So, in a set where each integer from 0 to 9 is paired with every other integer exactly once, there are specific tiles that are doubles.\n  \n- **Initial Brainstorming:** I could find the probability by determining how many doubles there are compared to the total number of dominoes in the set. But I'm not sure yet how to calculate each part.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Count the Number of Doubles and Total Dominoes:** This seems straightforward\u2014if I know both numbers, I can find the probability.\n  \n  2. **Consider the Total Number of Unique Pairs:** Since each pair (a, b) is the same as (b, a), maybe there's a symmetry I can leverage.\n  \n  3. **Think About the Sample Space and Favorable Outcomes:** Perhaps listing out or logically determining the sample space could help.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure if counting unique pairs directly will work because doubles are a specific subset. Do I need to account for symmetry here?\n\nAlright, let's explore these strategies one by one.\n\n### **Strategy 1: Count the Number of Doubles and Total Dominoes**\n\n**Step 1: Count the Total Number of Dominoes in the Set**\n\nEach integer from 0 to 9 is paired with every integer from 0 to 9 exactly once. \n\n- **Thought Process:** This is like creating a complete graph where each node (integer) is connected to every other node. Since each pair (a, b) is unordered (meaning (a, b) is the same as (b, a)), we shouldn't count duplicates.\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  - There are 10 integers (0-9).\n  - The number of unique pairs (including doubles) is the number of combinations of 10 taken 2 at a time plus the 10 doubles:\n    \n    \\[\n    \\text{Total Dominoes} = \\binom{10}{2} + 10 = 45 + 10 = 55\n    \\]\n    \n    Here, \\(\\binom{10}{2} = 45\\) is the number of unique pairs where the integers are different, and the \\(+10\\) accounts for the doubles.\n\n- **Check:** Wait, does this make sense? Yes, because \\(\\binom{10}{2}\\) gives the number of non-double dominoes, and adding the 10 doubles gives the total.\n\n**Step 2: Count the Number of Doubles**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Each integer from 0 to 9 has exactly one double domino (e.g., (0,0), (1,1), ..., (9,9)).\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of Doubles} = 10\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** Seems right\u2014there's one double for each integer.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability**\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Probability of Selecting a Double} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Doubles}}{\\text{Total Dominoes}} = \\frac{10}{55} = \\frac{2}{11}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** Let me quickly verify. The total number of dominoes is 55, and there are 10 doubles. So, \\(\\frac{10}{55}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{2}{11}\\). That looks correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAt this point, I'm feeling confident with the probability being \\(\\frac{2}{11}\\). But just to be thorough, let's explore another strategy to ensure it's correct.\n\n### **Strategy 2: Consider the Total Number of Unique Pairs**\n\n**Step 4: Verify Using Combinatorial Approach**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Maybe there's a more intuitive way by considering how dominoes are formed without counting duplicates manually.\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  - Each domino is an unordered pair (a, b) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers from 0 to 9.\n  - There are 10 choices for the first square and 10 for the second, but since the order doesn't matter, we divide by 2 to avoid duplicates:\n    \n    \\[\n    \\text{Total Dominoes} = \\frac{10 \\times 10}{2} = 50\n    \\]\n    \n    Wait, this doesn't match our first strategy's total of 55. Let me think this through.\n\n- **Issue Identified:** This approach doesn't account for doubles correctly. If we only count \\(\\frac{10 \\times 10}{2} = 50\\), we're missing the additional 5 doubles that should be included separately because each double was counted only once in the total pairs.\n\n- **Reflection:** Hmm, this suggests that my initial counting approach was more accurate. The combinatorial method needs to account for doubles separately to align with the total count.\n\n**Conclusion:** To ensure both methods align, the initial strategy is preferable here. The combinatorial approach gives a lower total by not fully accounting for doubles.\n\n### **Strategy 3: Think About the Sample Space and Favorable Outcomes**\n\n**Step 5: List the Sample Space**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Let's list out how many total dominoes and how many are doubles to visualize the probability better.\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  - Total unique dominoes: 55\n  - Total doubles: 10\n  \n- **Probability Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Probability} = \\frac{10}{55} = \\frac{2}{11}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** Matches our previous calculation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nListing out the sample space confirms the probability. It's always good to visualize the problem to ensure the calculations make sense.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Total Dominoes Confirmed:** 55\n- **Number of Doubles Confirmed:** 10\n- **Probability Simplified Correctly:** \\(\\frac{10}{55} = \\frac{2}{11}\\)\n\nEverything checks out. The probability that a randomly selected domino is a double is indeed \\(\\frac{2}{11}\\).\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThroughout the problem, I explored different strategies to ensure accuracy:\n\n- **Counting Approach:** Provided a clear path to the solution by directly accounting for total and favorable outcomes.\n  \n- **Combinatorial Insight:** Helped identify the need to separately account for doubles but initially led to an inconsistency that was resolved by reflection.\n  \n- **Sample Space Listing:** Reinforced the probability calculation by visualizing the components.\n\nReflecting on each step and checking the work frequently ensured that the final answer is correct. The probability of selecting a double domino is \\(\\frac{2}{11}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "To obtain this probability, we want to take the number of double pairings over the total number of pairings. Because each integer is paired with each other integer exactly once, we must be careful when counting how many integer pairings there are. That is, $0$ can be paired with $10$ other numbers, $1$ can be paired with $9$ other numbers (not $0$, because we've already paired $0$ and $1$), $2$ can be paired with $8$ other numbers, etc. So, there are $10 + 9 + \\ldots + 1 = 55$ pairings. Ten of these pairings are doubles ($00$, $11$, etc.). Thus, the probability of choosing a double is $\\frac{10}{55}$, which simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{11}}$."
