    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a real human thought process with brainstorming, reflection, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question, I'm thinking:\n\n- **What is a primitive root?** I've encountered this concept before. It\u2019s about finding an integer \\( a \\) such that its powers modulo \\( p \\) cover all the residues from \\( 1 \\) to \\( p-1 \\) exactly once.\n- **Given \\( p = 7 \\),** I need to find integers in the set \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\) that are primitive roots modulo \\( 7 \\).\n- **Wait, but how do I determine if an integer is a primitive root?** I'm recalling that it might involve checking the order of the integer modulo \\( 7 \\).\n\nInitially, I'm a bit uncertain about the best approach. Should I calculate the powers of each number up to \\( 6 \\) modulo \\( 7 \\)? Or is there a theoretical property I can leverage?\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate Powers Modulo \\( 7 \\):**\n   - Compute \\( a^k \\mod 7 \\) for each \\( a \\) in \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\) and see if all residues from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 6 \\) appear exactly once.\n\n2. **Use the Euler Totient Function \\( \\phi(p) \\):**\n   - Recall that for a prime \\( p \\), the number of primitive roots is \\( \\phi(p-1) \\). Since \\( 6 \\) is a prime, \\( \\phi(6) = 2 \\). This might help in identifying how many primitive roots to expect.\n\n3. **Explore Properties of Primitive Roots:**\n   - Remember that if \\( a \\) is a primitive root, then \\( a^k \\) for \\( k = 1, 2, \\ldots, p-1 \\) takes on all residues \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, p-1 \\) without repetition.\n   - Also, perhaps consider that primitive roots are related to generators of the multiplicative group modulo \\( p \\).\n\nHmm, calculating powers seems straightforward, but maybe there\u2019s a more efficient way using the Euler Totient function and properties of primitive roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Choosing a Strategy**\n\nGiven that \\( 7 \\) is a small prime, calculating powers directly seems manageable. However, I also want to check if my approach aligns with theoretical concepts, so I'll keep the Euler Totient function in mind to validate my findings.\n\nLet\u2019s start by calculating the powers modulo \\( 7 \\) for each candidate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Powers Modulo \\( 7 \\)**\n\nI'll compute \\( a^k \\mod 7 \\) for each \\( a \\) from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 6 \\) and \\( k \\) from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 6 \\):\n\n#### **a = 1**\n- \\( 1^1 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 1^2 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n- ...\n- All powers are \\( 1 \\).\n\n**Thought:** I\u2019m seeing that for \\( a = 1 \\), all powers are congruent to \\( 1 \\mod 7 \\). That doesn't cover all residues \\( 1 \\) to \\( 6 \\), so **1 is not a primitive root**.\n\n#### **a = 2**\n- \\( 2^1 \\mod 7 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 2^2 \\mod 7 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 2^3 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 2^4 \\mod 7 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 2^5 \\mod 7 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 2^6 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n\n**Reflection:** The powers of \\( 2 \\mod 7 \\) cycle through \\( 2, 4, 1 \\). This repeats every three steps. **Wait, that's a repeating cycle; it doesn't cover all residues uniquely.** So, **2 is not a primitive root**.\n\n#### **a = 3**\n- \\( 3^1 \\mod 7 = 3 \\)\n- \\( 3^2 \\mod 7 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 3^3 \\mod 7 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 3^4 \\mod 7 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 3^5 \\mod 7 = 5 \\)\n- \\( 3^6 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n\n**Check:** The sequence \\( 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1 \\) covers all residues \\( 1 \\) to \\( 6 \\) exactly once before repeating. **Aha!** This looks promising. **3 might be a primitive root.**\n\n#### **a = 4**\n- \\( 4^1 \\mod 7 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 4^2 \\mod 7 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 4^3 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 4^4 \\mod 7 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 4^5 \\mod 7 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 4^6 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n\n**Thought:** Similar to \\( 2 \\), \\( 4 \\) also cycles with a period of three: \\( 4, 2, 1 \\). So, **4 is not a primitive root**.\n\n#### **a = 5**\n- \\( 5^1 \\mod 7 = 5 \\)\n- \\( 5^2 \\mod 7 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 5^3 \\mod 7 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 5^4 \\mod 7 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 5^5 \\mod 7 = 3 \\)\n- \\( 5^6 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n\n**Check:** The sequence \\( 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1 \\) covers all residues \\( 1 \\) to \\( 6 \\) exactly once. **This is also a primitive root!**\n\n#### **a = 6**\n- \\( 6^1 \\mod 7 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 6^2 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 6^3 \\mod 7 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 6^4 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 6^5 \\mod 7 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 6^6 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n\n**Reflection:** The powers of \\( 6 \\mod 7 \\) alternate between \\( 6 \\) and \\( 1 \\). This doesn't cover all residues \\( 1 \\) to \\( 6 \\), so **6 is not a primitive root**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Summarizing the Findings**\n\nFrom the calculations:\n- **Primitive roots modulo 7:** \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\)\n- **Non-primitive roots:** \\( 1 \\), \\( 2 \\), \\( 4 \\), \\( 6 \\)\n\n**Check:** Wait, I should expect only **two primitive roots** since \\( \\phi(6) = 2 \\). This aligns with my findings.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verification Using Euler\u2019s Totient Function**\n\nJust to double-check, let's use the Euler Totient function:\n\n- \\( \\phi(6) = 6 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{2}) \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{3}) = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 2 \\)\n\nThis confirms that there should be **two primitive roots** modulo \\( 7 \\), which matches our findings (\\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\)).\n\n**Thought:** So, the calculation method seems correct since it aligns with the theoretical expectation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Sum of All Primitive Roots**\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of all integers in the set \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\) that are primitive roots modulo \\( 7 \\):\n\n- **Primitive roots identified:** \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\)\n- **Sum:** \\( 3 + 5 = 8 \\)\n\n**Check:** Adding up \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\) gives \\( 8 \\). Quick reflection: Does this make sense? Yes, because only \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\) were identified as primitive roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** The step-by-step calculation of powers modulo \\( 7 \\) correctly identified the primitive roots. The alignment with Euler\u2019s Totient function confirms the correctness.\n- **Answer Confidence:** I\u2019m confident that the sum of \\( 8 \\) is correct since all steps lead consistently to this conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer:** **8**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThroughout the process:\n- I started by brainstorming different strategies.\n- I chose to calculate powers directly, which led to identifying \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\) as primitive roots.\n- Verification using Euler\u2019s Totient function affirmed the findings.\n- Finally, I summed the identified primitive roots to arrive at the answer \\( 8 \\).\n\nReflecting naturally helped catch and confirm each step's correctness, ensuring a reliable solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Obviously, $1$ is not a primitive root $\\pmod 7$ (its powers are all congruent to $1$!).\n\nExamining the powers of $2$, we see that $\\{2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,\\ldots\\} \\equiv \\{2,4,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ with repetition from this point onward. Since the powers of $2$ do not include all residues from $1$ to $6\\pmod 7$, we see that $2$ is not a primitive root.\n\nThe logic of this example can be generalized. If $a$ is an integer and $a^k\\equiv 1\\pmod p$, then the powers of $a$ repeat on a cycle of length at most $k$. Therefore, for $a$ to be a primitive root, it is necessary that $a^k\\not\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ for all positive $k$ smaller than $p-1$. Conversely, if $a^k\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ for some positive $k$ smaller than $p-1$, then $a$ is not a primitive root $\\pmod p$. As examples, $4$ and $6$ are not primitive roots $\\pmod 7$, because $4^3\\equiv 1\\pmod 7$ and $6^2\\equiv 1\\pmod 7$.\n\nThis leaves $3$ and $5$ as candidates. Checking the powers of $3$ and $5$ modulo $7$, we see that \\begin{align*}\n3^1\\equiv 3,~ 3^2\\equiv 2,~3^3 \\equiv 6,~3^4\\equiv 4,~3^5\\equiv 5,~ 3^6\\equiv 1;\\\\\n5^1\\equiv 5,~ 5^2\\equiv 4,~5^3 \\equiv 6,~5^4\\equiv 2,~5^5\\equiv 3,~ 5^6\\equiv 1.\\,\n\\end{align*}Thus, $3,5$ are primitive roots of $7$, so the desired sum is $3+5=\\boxed{8}$."
