I'll brainstorm, reflect, and check my work as I go along to ensure we're on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**User Query:** What is the range of the function \\( G(x) = |x + 1| - |x - 1| \\)? Express the answer in interval notation.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- **Hmm, I see absolute values involved.** Functions with absolute values can often have interesting behavior, especially around the points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign.\n- **Wait, the expression involves both \\( |x + 1| \\) and \\( |x - 1| \\).** These are linear expressions with absolute values, which makes me think about their graphs and how they interact.\n- **I might need to look at different intervals based on where \\( x + 1 \\) and \\( x - 1 \\) are positive or negative.** This could help me understand how the function behaves in different parts of the real line.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Piecewise Analysis:** Break down the function into different cases based on the sign of \\( x + 1 \\) and \\( x - 1 \\). This seems straightforward since absolute values are defined piecewise.\n2. **Graphing the Function:** Plotting \\( G(x) \\) to visually inspect the range might be helpful to confirm findings from the piecewise approach.\n3. **Algebraic Simplification:** Attempting to simplify the expression algebraically to find critical points or to see if it resembles a known function.\n4. **Alternative Approaches:** Consider transformations or properties of absolute values that could simplify the analysis.\n\n**Thought:** **I think starting with a piecewise analysis makes the most sense.** It aligns with how absolute values are defined and should give a clear view of the function's behavior across different intervals.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Piecewise Analysis**\n\n**Objective:** Identify the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Find \\( x + 1 = 0 \\):**\n  \\[\n  x + 1 = 0 \\implies x = -1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Find \\( x - 1 = 0 \\):**\n  \\[\n  x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Okay, so the critical points are at \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\).** These points will likely be where the behavior of \\( G(x) \\) changes because they're where the absolute value expressions switch from negative to positive or vice versa.\n\n**Thought:** **I should look at intervals divided by these points: \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\), \\( [-1, 1) \\), and \\( [1, \\infty) \\).** This should cover all possible cases for \\( x \\). \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing Each Interval**\n\n**Objective:** Determine how \\( G(x) \\) behaves in each of the three intervals identified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Interval 1: \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **In this interval, \\( x < -1 \\):** So, \\( x + 1 < 0 \\) and \\( x - 1 < 0 \\).\n- **This means both expressions inside the absolute values are negative.**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Apply the definition of absolute value:**\n  \\[\n  |x + 1| = -(x + 1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |x - 1| = -(x - 1)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substitute into \\( G(x) \\):**\n  \\[\n  G(x) = |x + 1| - |x - 1| = (-(x + 1)) - (-(x - 1)) = -x - 1 + x - 1 = -2\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait, so \\( G(x) \\) is constantly -2 in this interval!** That's interesting. **I should check if this holds for other intervals too.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Interval 2: \\( [-1, 1) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Here, \\( x \\geq -1 \\) and \\( x < 1 \\):** So, \\( x + 1 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( x - 1 < 0 \\).\n- **This means \\( |x + 1| = x + 1 \\) and \\( |x - 1| = -(x - 1) \\).**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Substitute into \\( G(x) \\):**\n  \\[\n  G(x) = |x + 1| - |x - 1| = (x + 1) - (-(x - 1)) = x + 1 + x - 1 = 2x\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **So, in this interval, \\( G(x) \\) is a linear function \\( 2x \\).** \n- **Let me check the endpoints to ensure continuity.**\n\n**Checking at \\( x = -1 \\):**\n- **From the left (\\( x < -1 \\)):** \\( G(-1) = -2 \\).\n- **At \\( x = -1 \\):** \\( G(-1) = 2(-1) = -2 \\).\n- **So, the function is continuous at \\( x = -1 \\).**\n\n**Checking at \\( x = 1 \\):**\n- **From the right (\\( x > 1 \\)):** \\( G(1) = 2(1) = 2 \\).\n- **So, the function jumps from -2 to 2 at \\( x = 1 \\).**\n\n**Thought:** **This confirms that \\( G(x) = 2x \\) in \\( [-1, 1) \\).** But there's a discontinuity at \\( x = 1 \\), so I need to be careful when considering the range.\n\n---\n\n#### **Interval 3: \\( [1, \\infty) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **In this interval, \\( x \\geq 1 \\):** So, both \\( x + 1 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( x - 1 \\geq 0 \\).\n- **This means \\( |x + 1| = x + 1 \\) and \\( |x - 1| = x - 1 \\).**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Substitute into \\( G(x) \\):**\n  \\[\n  G(x) = |x + 1| - |x - 1| = (x + 1) - (x - 1) = x + 1 - x + 1 = 2\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **So, \\( G(x) \\) is constantly 2 in this interval.** Similarly to the first interval, it\u2019s constant, but this time at a different value.\n\n**Checking at \\( x = 1 \\):**\n- **From the left (\\( x < 1 \\)):** \\( G(1) = 2(1) = 2 \\).\n- **From the right (\\( x > 1 \\)):** \\( G(1) = 2 \\).\n- **There\u2019s no jump at \\( x = 1 \\) because \\( G(x) \\) is defined and continuous from both sides at this point.**\n\n**Thought:** **The function jumps from -2 to 2 at \\( x = 1 \\).** This suggests that the range might be from -2 to 2, excluding the jump.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Range of \\( G(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **From the piecewise analysis:**\n  - In \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\), \\( G(x) = -2 \\).\n  - In \\( [-1, 1) \\), \\( G(x) = 2x \\), which varies from -2 to 2 as \\( x \\) goes from -1 to 1.\n  - In \\( [1, \\infty) \\), \\( G(x) = 2 \\).\n\n- **Check for continuity:**\n  - At \\( x = -1 \\), \\( G(-1) = -2 \\).\n  - At \\( x = 1 \\), \\( G(1) = 2 \\) from both sides.\n\n- **However, there\u2019s a discontinuity between \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\):** The function jumps from -2 to 2.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Consider the limits:**\n  \\[\n  \\lim_{x \\to -1^-} G(x) = -2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{x \\to 1^-} G(x) = 2\n  \\]\n  \n- **But \\( G(1) = 2 \\) from the right side, so the range includes 2.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait, does this mean the range is all values between -2 and 2?** That seems too broad considering the constant parts outside these intervals.\n\n- **Let me think again:** The piecewise definition and the behavior at the boundaries suggest that the range is indeed between -2 and 2, including both endpoints but excluding the value exactly at \\( x = 1 \\) because of the discontinuity.\n\n**Check:** **Does this make sense?**\n\n- **In \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\), \\( G(x) = -2 \\).**\n- **In \\( [-1, 1) \\), \\( G(x) \\) increases from -2 to just below 2 (since at \\( x = 1 \\), the limit is 2 but not including 2 because of the jump).**\n- **In \\( [1, \\infty) \\), \\( G(x) = 2 \\).**\n\n**Thought:** **The range is indeed from -2 to 2.** However, because of the piecewise nature and the jump at \\( x = 1 \\), I need to express it carefully in interval notation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Expressing the Range in Interval Notation**\n\n**Objective:** **Write the range of \\( G(x) \\) in interval notation, considering the behavior at the boundaries.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **From the analysis:**\n  - The function takes on the value -2 at \\( x = -1 \\) and increases to 2 as \\( x \\) approaches 1 from the left.\n  - There\u2019s a jump at \\( x = 1 \\), where the function jumps from 2 to 2, but this doesn\u2019t affect the range since it\u2019s still 2.\n\n- **So, the range is all values between -2 and 2, inclusive of endpoints.**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\text{Range of } G(x) = [-2, 2]\n\\]\n\n**Check:** **Does this make sense?**\n\n- **Yes, the function covers all values from -2 to 2.**\n- **The jump at \\( x = 1 \\) doesn\u2019t exclude any values since both sides approach 2.**\n\n**Thought:** **I\u2019m confident that the range is correctly identified as [-2, 2].** The piecewise analysis and boundary checks support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n- **Throughout the process:**\n  - **Piecewise analysis helped break down the function\u2019s behavior across different intervals.**\n  - **Checking continuity at the boundaries ensured that the range was accurately captured.**\n  - **Reflecting on the conditions of each interval clarified how \\( G(x) \\) behaves.**\n\n- **Possible Mistakes:**\n  - **Initially, I considered whether the range might be affected by the discontinuity at \\( x = 1 \\).**\n  - **However, since both sides approach 2, the range remains inclusive of 2.**\n\n- **Alternative Methods:**\n  - **Graphing the function could provide a visual confirmation of the range.**\n  - **Algebraic transformations were not necessary here but could be useful in more complex cases.**\n\n**Final Verification:**\n- **Based on the piecewise analysis and continuity checks, the range is indeed [-2, 2].**\n- **The function\u2019s behavior is consistent with the properties of absolute values, ensuring that no values are missed in the range.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **The range of \\( G(x) = |x + 1| - |x - 1| \\) is \\([-2, 2]\\).**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step:\n\n- **I identified critical points and analyzed the function in each interval.**\n- **I reflected and checked work frequently to ensure correctness.**\n- **I carefully considered the effect of discontinuities on the range.**\n- **Finally, I verified that the range is accurately expressed in interval notation as \\([-2, 2]\\).**\n\n**This methodical approach ensured a comprehensive understanding and accurate solution to the problem.**",
