    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem just like we would if we were tackling it ourselves. I'll walk through my brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work as I go. Let's make this as human-like and natural as possible, complete with thoughts, doubts, and \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about John choosing 4 marbles from a set of 12, with the condition that exactly one marble is either red, green, or blue. Here are my initial thoughts:\n\n- **Sample Space Exploration:** This reminds me of problems involving combinations and selecting specific items from a group. I know combinatorics often deals with these kinds of selection problems.\n  \n- **Constraint of Uniqueness:** The requirement that exactly one of the chosen marbles is red, green, or blue adds a layer of complexity. It\u2019s not just about picking any 4 marbles but ensuring that only one of them falls into these specific color categories.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Combination Calculations:** Use combinations to calculate the number of ways to select marbles, considering the given constraints.\n  2. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Maybe consider this if overlapping categories need adjustment, but it seems more straightforward with combinations.\n  3. **Case Analysis:** Think about different cases based on which marble colors are included.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** At first glance, I'm leaning towards using combinations, but I'm not entirely sure how to account for the specific constraint regarding the red, green, and blue marbles.\n\nHmm, let\u2019s explore these strategies and see which works best.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Combination Calculations**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- I know that combinations can help us calculate the number of ways to select a certain number of items from a larger set.\n- Since we need to pick 4 marbles with exactly one being red, green, or blue, it seems logical to start by determining how to select the \u201cspecial\u201d colored marble and then the rest from the remaining ones.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Select the Special Colored Marble:**\n   - There are three options: red, green, or blue.\n   - So, there are 3 ways to choose which color will be the \u201cspecial\u201d one.\n\n2. **Select the Remaining Three Marbles:**\n   - The total number of marbles is 12, and we've already picked one as the special colored marble.\n   - We need to pick 3 more from the remaining 11 marbles.\n   - However, we must ensure that none of these three are red, green, or blue (to satisfy the condition of having exactly one).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Choose which color is the special one: **3 ways**.\n- **Step 2:** Choose 3 marbles from the remaining 11, excluding the other two colors (since one color is already selected).\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of ways} = \\binom{11}{3} \\text{ (choosing 3 from 11)}\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nWait, let me think about this. Does \\(\\binom{11}{3}\\) correctly account for excluding the other two colored marbles? Hmm... I need to double-check if I'm excluding the right marbles.\n\nAh, I realize I made an oversight. I should only exclude the two marbles that are *not* the selected special color. So, if I choose one color (say red), I have 10 marbles left to choose from (11 total minus the red and the two other colors).\n\nLet's correct this:\n\n- Total marbles left after picking the special color: 11 - 2 = 9.\n\nSo, the number of ways to pick 3 marbles from these 9:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ways} = \\binom{9}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me reflect. Does \\(\\binom{9}{3}\\) make sense here? Yes, because after selecting the special colored marble, we're left with 9 marbles that aren\u2019t part of the other two colors.\n\nLet\u2019s continue.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating \\(\\binom{9}{3}\\)**\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 84\n\\]\n\n**Total Number of Ways for Strategy 1:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = 3 \\times 84 = 252\n\\]\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Maybe I could use the inclusion-exclusion principle to avoid over-counting or under-counting certain combinations.\n- But looking back at my first strategy, it seems straightforward enough without needing this complex approach.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The inclusion-exclusion principle is more suited for problems where multiple overlapping sets need to be considered.\n- In this case, since we\u2019re dealing with distinct selections (only one marble being red, green, or blue), it might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, considering the constraints, I think Strategy 1 is cleaner and more direct. Let\u2019s stick with it unless something feels off.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Verification**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does having \\(\\binom{9}{3} = 84\\) make sense for selecting the remaining three marbles?\n- I\u2019ve excluded the other two colored marbles correctly, so it seems right.\n\n**Deep Reflection:**\n\n- The total number of ways calculated is **252**.\n- Considering all possible scenarios (choosing red, green, or blue as the special color and selecting the remaining marbles accordingly), this seems logical.\n\n**Multiple Checks:**\n\n- I've cross-checked the combination calculations.\n- The approach aligns with the problem\u2019s constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and ensuring each step aligns with the problem's requirements, the total number of ways John can choose 4 marbles with exactly one being red, green, or blue is **252**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Strategy Effectiveness:** Starting with combination calculations worked well because it directly addressed the selection requirements.\n- **Mistake Correction:** Initially, I almost over-counted by not correctly excluding the non-selected colored marbles.\n- **Reflection Importance:** Regularly checking and reflecting on each step ensured the approach remained correct and aligned with the problem's constraints.\n- **Human-Like Approach:** Emulating how I think naturally helped catch errors and validate the solution throughout the process.\n\nOverall, bringing a human touch\u2014complete with brainstorming, reflecting, and checking along the way\u2014ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",
