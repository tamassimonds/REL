I recall that the overline indicates a repeating decimal. So, \\(0.4\\overline{5}\\) likely means that the digit \"5\" repeats indefinitely after the \"4.\"\n\n- **Similar Problems I've Encountered:**  \n  This reminds me of converting simple repeating decimals to fractions, like \\(0.\\overline{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\). I\u2019ve done that before, so maybe I can apply a similar strategy here.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Set Up an Equation:**  \n     Use a variable to represent the decimal and manipulate it to eliminate the repeating part.\n     \n  2. **Use a Geometric Series Formula:**  \n     Recall that repeating decimals can be expressed as the sum of an infinite geometric series.\n\n  3. **Conversion Method for Mixed Repeating Decimals:**  \n     Since there's a non-repeating part before the repeating section, perhaps a combination of techniques is needed.\n\n- **Feeling Uncertain:**  \n  Wait a minute\u2014I've mostly dealt with entirely repeating decimals. Adding a non-repeating part makes me a bit unsure. Do I need to adjust my approach to account for this?\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nLet\u2019s explore each strategy briefly to see which might work best:\n\n1. **Set Up an Equation:**\n   - This is a classic method. I remember using it for \\(0.\\overline{3}\\). It seems straightforward, but I need to tweak it since only part of the decimal repeats.\n\n2. **Geometric Series Formula:**\n   - This could work because repeating decimals are infinite series. But applying it directly might get complicated with the non-repeating part.\n\n3. **Combination of Both:**\n   - Maybe I can set up an equation for the entire decimal and use properties of repeating decimals to simplify.\n\n- **Choosing a Starting Point:**  \n  I'll start with the **Set Up an Equation** method because it's familiar and seems direct. If it gets messy, I'll pivot to using the Geometric Series approach.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s denote the repeating decimal:\n\n\\[\nx = 0.455555\\ldots\n\\]\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  To eliminate the repeating part, I need to shift the decimal point so that the repeating \"5\" aligns with itself after some operations.\n\n- **Determining Shifts:**\n  - **Non-Repeating Part:** There\u2019s one digit (\"4\") before the repeating \"5,\" so I\u2019ll multiply by 10 to shift the decimal point one place right.\n\n\\[\n10x = 4.55555\\ldots\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Okay, now both equations have the repeating part starting at the same position. This should help eliminate the repeating section when I subtract them.\n\n### **Step 2: Subtracting the Two Equations**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll set up another equation to remove the repeating part:\n\n\\[\nx = 0.45555\\ldots \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\\[\n10x = 4.5555\\ldots \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n- **Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:**\n\n\\[\n10x - x = 4.5555\\ldots - 0.4555\\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9x = 4.5555\\ldots - 0.4555\\ldots\n\\]\n\n- **Calculuation:**\n\n\\[\n9x = 4.1\n\\]\n\n- **Check:**  \n  Wait, does this subtraction make sense? Let me briefly verify:\n\n  - **4.5555\u2026 - 0.4555\u2026 = 4.1**  \n    Yes, that\u2019s correct. The repeating \u201c5\u201ds cancel out, leaving just the difference in the non-repeating parts.\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)**\n\nNow, solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n9x = 4.1\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4.1}{9}\n\\]\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Simple division. But wait\u2014\\(4.1\\) isn\u2019t an integer. To express it as a fraction with an integer numerator, I should convert \\(4.1\\) first.\n\n- **Converting \\(4.1\\) to a Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n4.1 = \\frac{41}{10}\n\\]\n\n- **Substituting Back:**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{41/10}{9} = \\frac{41}{90}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  That looks clean. But let me double-check by simplifying if possible.\n\n- **Simplification Check:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{41}{90} \\text{ is already in its simplest form since 41 is a prime number and doesn't divide 90.}\n\\]\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore accepting this as the final answer, let\u2019s verify if \\(0.4\\overline{5}\\) indeed equals \\(\\frac{41}{90}\\).\n\n- **Using Long Division:**  \n  I could divide \\(41\\) by \\(90\\) to see if it reproduces \\(0.455555\\ldots\\).\n\n- **Quick Division Check:**\n\n  - \\(90\\) goes into \\(41\\) zero times, so the decimal starts with \\(0.\\)\n  - \\(41\\) divided by \\(90\\) is \\(0.455555\\ldots\\) (repeating \\(5\\))\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The long division confirms the result. Thus, \\(0.4\\overline{5} = \\frac{41}{90}\\).\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Geometric Series**\n\nJust to ensure our method is correct, let\u2019s briefly explore using the Geometric Series approach.\n\n- **Expressing the Decimal as a Series:**\n\n\\[\n0.4\\overline{5} = 0.4 + 0.0\\overline{5} = \\frac{4}{10} + \\frac{0.\\overline{5}}{10}\n\\]\n\n- **Calculating \\(0.\\overline{5}\\) Using Series:**\n\n\\[\n0.\\overline{5} = 0.5 + 0.05 + 0.005 + 0.0005 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThis is an infinite geometric series with:\n\n- First term \\(a = 0.5\\)\n- Common ratio \\(r = 0.1\\)\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r} = \\frac{0.5}{1 - 0.1} = \\frac{0.5}{0.9} = \\frac{5}{9}\n\\]\n\n- **Adding the Non-Repeating Part:**\n\n\\[\n0.4 + \\frac{5}{90} = \\frac{4}{10} + \\frac{5}{90} = \\frac{36}{90} + \\frac{5}{90} = \\frac{41}{90}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This confirms our previous result. Both methods lead to the same fraction, \\(\\frac{41}{90}\\).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThrough the equation setup method and verifying with the geometric series approach, we find:\n\n\\[\n0.4\\overline{5} = \\frac{41}{90}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Approach Validity:**  \n  Initially, I considered multiple strategies and chose the equation setup method, which is straightforward for converting repeating decimals.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Checks:**  \n  After each major step\u2014subtracting equations, solving for \\(x\\), and simplifying\u2014I double-checked the arithmetic to ensure correctness.\n\n- **Alternative Method Confirmation:**  \n  By applying the geometric series method, I verified that the result is consistent across different approaches.\n\n- **Final Verification using Division:**  \n  A quick long division check confirmed that \\(\\frac{41}{90}\\) indeed equals \\(0.455555\\ldots\\), validating the solution.\n\n- **Mistakes and Adjustments:**  \n  Initially, I contemplated using the geometric series directly but found the equation method more intuitive. I paused to ensure each calculation was correct, avoiding potential errors.\n\n- **Thinking Flow:**  \n  Throughout, I maintained a reflective mindset, checking if each step made sense and aligning with the expected outcome.\n\n---\n\nBy thoroughly exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the final result, I've confidently determined that \\(0.4\\overline{5}\\) expressed as a common fraction is \\(\\frac{41}{90}\\).",
