    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking for correctness, and being open to changing methods if something doesn't seem right. Let's start by really understanding what's being asked.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Given:** \\(x + \\frac{1}{x} = 3\\)\n- **Need to find:** \\(S_m = x^m + \\frac{1}{x^m}\\) for \\(m = 7\\)\n\nMy initial reaction is that this looks familiar\u2014maybe I can use a recurrence relation or some properties of powers. But to be sure, let me brainstorm a few strategies:\n\n1. **Recurrence Relation:** Since \\(S_m\\) involves powers of \\(x\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\), perhaps there's a pattern or recurrence I can find.\n  \n2. **Expressing Higher Powers in Terms of Lower Ones:** Maybe I can express \\(x^m + \\frac{1}{x^m}\\) in terms of \\(x^{m-1} + \\frac{1}{x^{m-1}}\\) and \\(x^{m-2} + \\frac{1}{x^{m-2}}\\).\n\n3. **Finding a Numeric Value of \\(x\\):** Compute \\(x\\) directly from the given equation and then calculate \\(S_7\\) numerically.\n\n4. **Using Symmetrical Properties or Identities:** Think about any algebraic identities that relate \\(x\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\).\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Recurrence Relation**\n\nI think starting with a recurrence relation makes sense because the problem asks for \\(S_m\\) in terms of previous terms. Let's see if I can relate \\(S_m\\) to \\(S_{m-1}\\) and \\(S_{m-2}\\).\n\n**Brainstorming How to Set It Up:**\n\n- I know that \\(S_m = x^m + \\frac{1}{x^m}\\).\n- I need to find a relationship that links \\(S_m\\), \\(S_{m-1}\\), and \\(S_{m-2}\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait, I can use the fact that multiplying \\(S_{m-1}\\) by \\(x\\) gives me part of \\(S_m\\):\n\n\\[\nx^m + \\frac{1}{x^m} = x \\cdot x^{m-1} + \\frac{1}{x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^{m-1}} = x S_{m-1} + \\frac{1}{x} S_{m-1}\n\\]\n\nBut I need to incorporate \\(S_{m-2}\\) somehow. I remember that:\n\n\\[\n(x + \\frac{1}{x})(x^{m-1} + \\frac{1}{x^{m-1}}) = x^m + \\frac{1}{x^m} + x^{m-2} + \\frac{1}{x^{m-2}}\n\\]\n\nSo, maybe:\n\n\\[\nS_m = (x + \\frac{1}{x}) S_{m-1} - S_{m-2}\n\\]\n\n**Checking This Idea:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Let me see:\n\n- According to the given, \\(x + \\frac{1}{x} = 3\\).\n- So the relation becomes: \\(S_m = 3 S_{m-1} - S_{m-2}\\)\n\nThis looks promising. Let's proceed with this formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Compute \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\)**\n\nBefore I can compute \\(S_7\\), I need to find \\(S_3\\), \\(S_4\\), and so on, up to \\(S_7\\). But to use the recurrence relation, I need initial values.\n\n**Calculating \\(S_1\\):**\n\n\\[\nS_1 = x^1 + \\frac{1}{x^1} = x + \\frac{1}{x} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(S_2\\):**\n\n\\[\nS_2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}\n\\]\n\nI remember there's a formula that relates \\(S_2\\) to \\(S_1\\):\n\n\\[\nS_2 = (x + \\frac{1}{x})^2 - 2 = S_1^2 - 2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nS_2 = 3^2 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat seems correct. \\(S_2\\) should be greater than \\(S_1\\) since squaring increases the value and subtracting 2 still keeps it positive.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Apply the Recurrence Relation**\n\nNow that I have \\(S_1 = 3\\) and \\(S_2 = 7\\), let's compute higher \\(S_m\\) using the relation \\(S_m = 3 S_{m-1} - S_{m-2}\\).\n\n**Calculating \\(S_3\\):**\n\n\\[\nS_3 = 3 S_2 - S_1 = 3 \\times 7 - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\nDoes this make sense? \\(S_3\\) should be larger than \\(S_2\\), and indeed \\(18 > 7\\).\n\n---\n\n**Calculating \\(S_4\\):**\n\n\\[\nS_4 = 3 S_3 - S_2 = 3 \\times 18 - 7 = 54 - 7 = 47\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\n\\(47 > 18\\), which is expected.\n\n---\n\n**Calculating \\(S_5\\):**\n\n\\[\nS_5 = 3 S_4 - S_3 = 3 \\times 47 - 18 = 141 - 18 = 123\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\n\\(123 > 47\\), so this checks out.\n\n---\n\n**Calculating \\(S_6\\):**\n\n\\[\nS_6 = 3 S_5 - S_4 = 3 \\times 123 - 47 = 369 - 47 = 322\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\n\\(322 > 123\\), which is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Calculating \\(S_7\\):**\n\n\\[\nS_7 = 3 S_6 - S_5 = 3 \\times 322 - 123 = 966 - 123 = 843\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nLet me double-check this calculation:\n\n\\[\nS_6 = 322\n\\]\n\\[\n3 \\times 322 = 966\n\\]\n\\[\n966 - 123 = 843\n\\]\n\nYes, the math checks out. \n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nS_7 = 843\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Strategy Validation:** The recurrence relation approach worked well, providing a clear and systematic way to compute \\(S_7\\) using earlier terms.\n  \n- **Correctness Check:** Throughout the calculations, each step made sense numerically, and the values increased as expected.\n\n- **Reflection:** Initially brainstorming different methods helped confirm that applying a recurrence relation was the most efficient strategy here.\n\n- **Mistake Acknowledgment:** I didn't encounter major mistakes, but being open to re-evaluating each step ensured accuracy.\n\nOverall, by starting with a solid understanding, exploring multiple strategies, and carefully checking each calculation, I arrived confidently at the solution.",
