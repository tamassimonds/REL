I'll aim to write in a style that mimics human thought processes, complete with initial confusion, \"aha\" moments, and corrections along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem:\n\n**The function:**  \n\\[ f(x) = x^2 - ax + 2a \\]\n\n**Given:**  \nThe zeroes (roots) of this function are integers.\n\n**Goal:**  \nFind the sum of all possible values of \\( a \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**  \n- **Quadratic Functions:** This reminds me of the standard quadratic equation \\( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). I recall that the roots can be related to the coefficients via Vieta's formulas.\n  \n- **Integer Roots:** Since the roots are integers, maybe there's something about the coefficients that we can exploit\u2014like the relationships between the roots and the coefficients.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Vieta's Formulas:** Use the fact that the sum and product of the roots relate to \\( a \\) and \\( 2a \\).\n  2. **Discriminant Approach:** Ensure the discriminant is a perfect square, which is necessary for the roots to be integers.\n  3. **Factoring:** Try to factor the quadratic to see if it provides insights.\n\n- **Possible Starting Points:**  \n  - I could start with Vieta's formulas because they directly relate the roots to coefficients.\n  - Alternatively, I could check the discriminant right away to see if it leads me somewhere.\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**  \nThinking about it, Vieta's formulas might be straightforward, but ensuring the discriminant is a perfect square is also a solid approach, especially since we're dealing with integer roots.\n\n**Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...**  \nLet's try the **Discriminant Approach** first. If that doesn't work out, I'll switch to Vieta's.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the Discriminant**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFor a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the roots are integers if the discriminant \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\) is a perfect square.\n\n**Applying to Our Function:**  \nGiven \\( f(x) = x^2 - ax + 2a \\), where \\( b = -a \\) and \\( c = 2a \\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\\[ D = (-a)^2 - 4(1)(2a) = a^2 - 8a \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so for the roots to be integers, \\( a^2 - 8a \\) must be a perfect square.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs \\( a^2 - 8a \\) always a perfect square for integer \\( a \\)? Let's see if we can find integer values of \\( a \\) that satisfy this.\n\n**Does this make sense?**  \nIf \\( a^2 - 8a \\) being a perfect square leads us to integer values of \\( a \\), then this might be the right path.\n\n**Random Insight:**  \nPerhaps \\( a \\) must be such that the expression forms a perfect square trinomial or something similar.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's set \\( a^2 - 8a = k^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer. This will help us find all possible integer values of \\( a \\).\n\n**Equation:**  \n\\[ a^2 - 8a - k^2 = 0 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks like a quadratic equation in terms of \\( a \\). We can attempt to find integer solutions for \\( a \\) by seeing which values of \\( k \\) make the discriminant a perfect square.\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**  \nDoesn't this just lead to another quadratic? Maybe I need to think differently.\n\n**Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...**  \nInstead of diving deeper into quadratics, maybe I should list out potential \\( a \\) values and see if they work.\n\n**Aha Moment:**  \nWait, perhaps there's a better way\u2014consider values of \\( a \\) where \\( a^2 - 8a \\) is a perfect square. Maybe \\( a \\) is within a specific range.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for Integer \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's look for integer values of \\( a \\) such that \\( a^2 - 8a \\) is a perfect square. This means:\n\n\\[ a^2 - 8a = n^2 \\]\n  \nwhere \\( n \\) is an integer.\n\n**Rearranging the Equation:**  \n\\[ a^2 - 8a - n^2 = 0 \\]\n\n**Calculations:**  \nThe discriminant of this quadratic in \\( a \\) must be a perfect square:\n\n\\[ D = (-8)^2 - 4(1)(-n^2) = 64 + 4n^2 = 4(n^2 + 16) \\]\n\nFor \\( D \\) to be a perfect square, \\( n^2 + 16 \\) must be a perfect square.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, we're looking for integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 + 16 \\) is a perfect square. This requires \\( n^2 + 16 \\) to be of the form \\( m^2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\n**Check:**  \nIs \\( n^2 + 16 = m^2 \\) possible?\n\n\\[ m^2 - n^2 = 16 \\]\n  \nThis can be factored as:\n\n\\[ (m - n)(m + n) = 16 \\]\n\n**Does this make sense?**  \nBy factoring, we can find integer solutions for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), which will correspond to integer values of \\( a \\).\n\n**Random Insight:**  \nThe factors of 16 can give us possible pairs \\( (m - n) \\) and \\( (m + n) \\). Let's list them out:\n\n- \\( (1, 16) \\)\n- \\( (2, 8) \\)\n- \\( (4, 4) \\)\n- Negative pairs also, but since we're dealing with squares, positive \\( n \\) suffices.\n\n**Possible Pairs:**\n1. \\( m - n = 1 \\), \\( m + n = 16 \\)\n2. \\( m - n = 2 \\), \\( m + n = 8 \\)\n3. \\( m - n = 4 \\), \\( m + n = 4 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThese pairs can be solved to find integer values of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), which can then give us corresponding \\( a \\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Pairs**\n\nLet's solve each pair to find possible \\( n \\):\n\n1. **First Pair:**  \n   \\[ m - n = 1 \\]  \n   \\[ m + n = 16 \\]  \n   \n   Adding these:\n   \\[ 2m = 17 \\implies m = 8.5 \\]  \n   \n   But \\( m \\) must be an integer. **Wait**, this doesn't work.\n\n2. **Second Pair:**  \n   \\[ m - n = 2 \\]  \n   \\[ m + n = 8 \\]  \n   \n   Adding these:\n   \\[ 2m = 10 \\implies m = 5 \\]  \n   \n   Substituting back:\n   \\[ 5 - n = 2 \\implies n = 3 \\]  \n   \n   So, \\( m = 5 \\), \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n3. **Third Pair:**  \n   \\[ m - n = 4 \\]  \n   \\[ m + n = 4 \\]  \n   \n   Adding these:\n   \\[ 2m = 8 \\implies m = 4 \\]  \n   \n   Substituting back:\n   \\[ 4 - n = 4 \\implies n = 0 \\]  \n   \n   So, \\( m = 4 \\), \\( n = 0 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis gives us two sets of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\):\n- \\( (m, n) = (5, 3) \\)\n- \\( (m, n) = (4, 0) \\)\n\n**Check:**  \nDo these correspond to valid \\( a \\) values? Let's see.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Mapping Back to \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe need to find \\( a \\) corresponding to each valid \\( n \\), since \\( a^2 - 8a = n^2 \\).\n\n**Possibilities:**\n\n1. **From \\( n = 3 \\):**\n   \\[ a^2 - 8a = 9 \\]  \n   \\[ a^2 - 8a - 9 = 0 \\]  \n   \n   Solving this using the quadratic formula:\n   \\[ a = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 36}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm 10}{2} \\]  \n   \n   So,\n   \\[ a = \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a = \\frac{-2}{2} = -1 \\]  \n   \n   Possible \\( a \\): **9, -1**\n\n2. **From \\( n = 0 \\):**\n   \\[ a^2 - 8a = 0 \\]  \n   \\[ a(a - 8) = 0 \\]  \n   \n   So,\n   \\[ a = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a = 8 \\]  \n   \n   Possible \\( a \\): **0, 8**\n\n**Combining All Possible \\( a \\):**  \n\\[ a = -1, 0, 8, 9 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThese are the values of \\( a \\) where the original quadratic has integer roots.\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, let's double-check if all these values actually make the discriminant a perfect square.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Discriminant for Each \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEnsure that for each \\( a \\) value found, the discriminant \\( a^2 - 8a \\) is indeed a perfect square.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **For \\( a = -1 \\):**\n   \\[ D = (-1)^2 - 8(-1) = 1 + 8 = 9 \\]  \n   \\[ \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\text{ (perfect square)} \\]  \n   \n   (**Wait, that works!**)\n\n2. **For \\( a = 0 \\):**\n   \\[ D = 0^2 - 8(0) = 0 \\]  \n   \\[ \\sqrt{0} = 0 \\text{ (perfect square)} \\]  \n   \n   (**Great, this also works!**)\n\n3. **For \\( a = 8 \\):**\n   \\[ D = 8^2 - 8(8) = 64 - 64 = 0 \\]  \n   \\[ \\sqrt{0} = 0 \\text{ (perfect square)} \\]  \n   \n   (**Perfect, this works too!**)\n\n4. **For \\( a = 9 \\):**\n   \\[ D = 9^2 - 8(9) = 81 - 72 = 9 \\]  \n   \\[ \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\text{ (perfect square)} \\]  \n   \n   (**And this one works as well!**)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll possible \\( a \\) values result in the discriminant being a perfect square, confirming that the roots are indeed integers.\n\n**Does this make sense?**  \nYes, this confirms that our approach was correct.\n\n**Aha Moment:**  \nIt seems that by ensuring the discriminant is a perfect square, we've successfully identified all possible \\( a \\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Summing Up the Possible Values of \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that we have all possible \\( a \\) values where the roots are integers, let's sum them up to find the answer.\n\n**Possible \\( a \\):**  \n\\[ a = -1, 0, 8, 9 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ \\text{Sum} = -1 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 16 \\]  \n   \n(**Check:** Wait, does this sum make sense? Let's quickly verify.)\n\n**Quick Verification:**  \n- Adding negatives and positives:  \n  \\[ -1 + 0 = -1 \\]  \n  \\[ -1 + 8 = 7 \\]  \n  \\[ 7 + 9 = 16 \\]  \n  \n  (**Yes, the sum is indeed 16.**)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis matches one of the answer choices, so it seems correct.\n\n**Does this make sense?**  \nYes, summing up the valid \\( a \\) values gives us 16, which is one of the options provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Final Check and Reflection**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore concluding, let's ensure that no possible \\( a \\) values were missed and that the method used was correct.\n\n**Checklist:**\n\n1. **Did I consider all possible \\( n \\)?**\n   - Yes, by solving \\( n^2 + 16 = m^2 \\), all integer solutions were found.\n\n2. **Did I verify the discriminant for each \\( a \\)?**\n   - Yes, each \\( a \\) value led to a perfect square discriminant.\n\n3. **Was there any point where the approach seemed off?**\n   - Initially, trying to set up \\( a^2 - 8a = k^2 \\) led to recognizing the need for perfect squares, which aligned with verifying the discriminant.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**Does this make sense?**  \nThe sum of the possible \\( a \\) values being 16 aligns with the methods used and the problem's requirements. All steps check out, confirming the correctness of the approach.\n\n**Aha Moment:**  \nBy ensuring the discriminant was a perfect square, we could directly identify all valid \\( a \\) values, making the process efficient and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming different strategies and carefully verifying each step, we've determined that the sum of all possible values of \\( a \\) for which the zeroes of the function \\( f(x) = x^2 - ax + 2a \\) are integers is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]\n\nBy exploring various methods, checking our work diligently, and reflexively adjusting our approach as needed, we've arrived at the correct and confident solution.",

  "ground_truth": "By Vieta's Formula, $a$ is the sum of the integral zeros of the function, and so $a$ is integral.\nBecause the zeros are integral, the discriminant of the function, $a^2 - 8a$, is a perfect square, say $k^2$. Then adding 16 to both sides and completing the square yields\\[(a - 4)^2 = k^2 + 16.\\]Therefore $(a-4)^2 - k^2 = 16$ and\\[((a-4) - k)((a-4) + k) = 16.\\]Let $(a-4) - k = u$ and $(a-4) + k = v$; then, $a-4 = \\dfrac{u+v}{2}$ and so $a = \\dfrac{u+v}{2} + 4$. Listing all possible $(u, v)$ pairs (not counting transpositions because this does not affect ($u + v$), $(2, 8), (4, 4), (-2, -8), (-4, -4)$, yields $a = 9, 8, -1, 0$. These $a$ sum to $16$, so our answer is $\\boxed{16}$."
