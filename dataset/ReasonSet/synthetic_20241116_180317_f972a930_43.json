    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were tackling this problem on my own.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about counting the number of words possible in the Mumblian alphabet, which has only **5 letters** and allows words of up to **3 letters** long. Importantly, words can use each letter more than once, and ***0 letters*** doesn't count as a word.\n\nWhen I first see this, I think:\n\n- **This looks similar to counting permutations or combinations, but with repetition allowed.** I remember dealing with problems like this before where order matters and letters can repeat.\n\n- **Maybe I can break it down by the length of the words\u20141-letter, 2-letter, and 3-letter words.** That seems like a logical approach.\n\n- **But wait, I need to make sure I don't count the empty word (0 letters) since it doesn't count.** I have to remember to exclude that from my total.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate the number of possible words for each length separately:**\n   - **1-letter words**\n   - **2-letter words**\n   - **3-letter words**\n\n2. **Sum the possibilities for each word length to get the total.**\n\n3. **Consider if there's a formula that directly applies to this scenario, like permutations with repetition.**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first strategy\u2014calculating the number of words for each length.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating 1-Letter Words**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- There are **5 letters** in the Mumblian alphabet.\n- Each **1-letter word** can be any of those 5 letters.\n- So, the number of 1-letter words should be straightforward: **5.**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of 1-letter words} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems correct because each letter itself is a valid 1-letter word.\n- **Quick Check:** Counting the letters\u2014yep, there are 5.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating 2-Letter Words**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- For **2-letter words**, each position can be filled by any of the 5 letters.\n- This is similar to finding permutations with repetition: **5 choices for the first letter and 5 for the second.**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of 2-letter words} = 5 \\times 5 = 25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait a minute...** This makes sense because each letter can repeat, so there are 25 combinations.\n- **Quick Check:** \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)\u2014yep, that adds up.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating 3-Letter Words**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Similarly, for **3-letter words**, each position can be any of the 5 letters.\n- Again, this is permutations with repetition: **5 choices for each of the three positions.**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of 3-letter words} = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does this look right?** Let me think\u2014each position is independent, so the calculation should be correct.\n- **Quick Check:** \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\\)\u2014yep, that works.\n\n### **Step 4: Summing Up the Possibilities**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, I need to add the number of words for each length to get the total number of possible words.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of words} = \\text{1-letter} + \\text{2-letter} + \\text{3-letter} = 5 + 25 + 125 = 155\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Adding them up\u20145 + 25 = 30, and 30 + 125 = 155. That seems correct.\n- **Does this align with my initial thoughts?** Yes, breaking it down by word length makes it easier to manage.\n\n### **Step 5: Considering Alternative Approaches**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Is there a more efficient way to calculate this?**\n- Maybe I could use a formula for counting combinations with repetition, but since we're dealing with a fixed number of positions and repetition is allowed, the multiplication method works well here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait, maybe there's a combinatorial formula I could apply, like \\( n^k \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of letters and \\( k \\) is the word length.**\n- But I think the step-by-step multiplication is clear and straightforward for this problem.\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Total**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Does the total make sense given the problem conditions?**\n- We accounted for all possible word lengths (1 to 3).\n- Each calculation considers repetition and the number of available letters.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **1-letter words:** 5 options.\n- **2-letter words:** \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) options.\n- **3-letter words:** \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\\) options.\n- **Total:** 5 + 25 + 125 = 155.\n\n**Does it seem correct?** Yes, everything checks out.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{155}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Brainstorming helped:** Initially, I considered different ways to approach the problem and settled on calculating each word length separately.\n- **Step-by-step calculation made it manageable:** This ensured I didn\u2019t overlook any part of the problem.\n- **Reflection and checks were crucial:** Continuously checking and reflecting on each step confirmed the correctness of the approach and the final answer.\n- **Alternative methods considered:** Thinking about using formulas like \\( n^k \\) validated that the straightforward multiplication was appropriate here.\n\nOverall, tackling the problem step-by-step, reflecting frequently, and being open to adjusting the approach led to the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Often, the tricky part of casework problems is deciding what the cases should be. For this problem, it makes sense to use as our cases the number of letters in each word.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 1: (1-letter words) There are $5$ 1-letter words (each of the $5$ letters is itself a 1-letter word).\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 2: (2-letter words) To form a 2-letter word, we have $5$ choices for our first letter, and $5$ choices for our second letter. Thus there are $5 \\times 5 = 25$ 2-letter words possible.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 3: (3-letter words) To form a 3-letter word, we have $5$ choices for our first letter, $5$ choices for our second letter, and $5$ choices for our third letter. Thus there are $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125$ 3-letter words possible.\n\nSo to get the total number of words in the language, we add the number of words from each of our cases. (We need to make sure that the cases are exclusive, meaning they don't overlap. But that's clear in this solution, since, for example, a word can't be both a 2-letter word and a 3-letter word at the same time.)\n\nTherefore there are $5 + 25 + 125 = \\boxed{155}$ words possible on Mumble. (I guess the Mumblians don't have a lot to say.)"
