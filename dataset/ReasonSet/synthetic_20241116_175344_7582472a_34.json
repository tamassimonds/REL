I'll approach it as I would naturally think through it, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work frequently to ensure I\u2019m on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\n**User Query:**  \nA piece of cheese is located at \\((12,10)\\) in a coordinate plane. A mouse is at \\((4,-2)\\) and is running up the line \\(y=-5x+18\\). At the point \\((a,b)\\), the mouse starts getting farther from the cheese rather than closer to it. What is \\(a + b\\)?\n\n**Initial Impressions:**\n\n- **Coordinates:** We have specific points on a plane \u2013 the cheese at \\((12,10)\\) and the mouse starting at \\((4,-2)\\).\n- **Mouse\u2019s Path:** The mouse is moving along the line \\(y = -5x + 18\\).\n- **Turning Point:** We need to find the point \\((a, b)\\) where the mouse stops getting closer to the cheese and starts moving away.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis problem seems to involve geometry, specifically understanding the relationship between the mouse\u2019s path and its distance to the cheese. It reminds me of problems involving minimizing or maximizing distances, possibly using concepts from calculus or the properties of perpendicular lines.\n\nBut before jumping into complex methods, let's explore simpler strategies to see if they can lead us to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Graphical Method:**\n   - **Idea:** Plot the line and the cheese\u2019s position to visually identify where the mouse starts moving away.\n   - **Reflection:** This might provide a quick intuitive answer but may lack precision.\n\n2. **Algebraic Approach:**\n   - **Idea:** Use distance formulas to find when the mouse is closest to the cheese.\n   - **Reflection:** This seems more systematic and could yield an exact point.\n\n3. **Calculus Approach:**\n   - **Idea:** If considering optimizing the distance, derivatives could help find minimum or maximum distances.\n   - **Reflection:** This is more advanced and might be overkill for a problem that seems solvable with basic algebra.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the options, **Algebraic Approach** seems the most straightforward and precise. It allows for an exact solution without the complexity of calculus. However, if this method becomes cumbersome, I might reconsider using calculus.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Approach Using Algebraic Method**\n\n#### **Step 1: Understanding the Mouse\u2019s Path**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThe mouse is moving along the line \\(y = -5x + 18\\). To find the point where it starts getting farther from the cheese, I need to determine the point on this line closest to \\((12,10)\\).\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- **Concept:** The closest point on a line to a given point lies where the line perpendicular to it through the given point intersects the line.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis aligns with geometric principles. By finding where the perpendicular from the cheese to the mouse's path intersects the mouse's line, I can pinpoint the desired \\((a, b)\\).\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Finding the Equation of the Perpendicular Line**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nTo find where the perpendicular line intersects the mouse\u2019s path, I need the equation of this perpendicular line.\n\n- **Given:** The mouse's line is \\(y = -5x + 18\\).\n- **Slope of Mouse\u2019s Line:** \\(-5\\)\n- **Slope of Perpendicular Line:** The product of slopes of two perpendicular lines is \\(-1\\). So, if the slope is \\(-5\\), the perpendicular slope is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\n**Equation of Perpendicular Line:**\n\n- **Point on Cheese:** \\((12, 10)\\)\n- **Slope:** \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)\n\nUsing the point-slope form of a line:\n\\[\ny - 10 = \\frac{1}{5}(x - 12)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems straightforward. I\u2019ll simplify this equation to make it easier to work with.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Simplify:**  \n  \\[\n  y - 10 = \\frac{1}{5}x - \\frac{12}{5}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{1}{5}x - \\frac{12}{5} + 10\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{1}{5}x - \\frac{12}{5} + \\frac{50}{5}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{38}{5}\n  \\]\n  \nThe simplified equation of the perpendicular line is:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{38}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, does this make sense?  \n- **Slope Verification:** The slope \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) is indeed perpendicular to \\(-5\\).\n- **Point Verification:** The line passes through \\((12, 10)\\).\n\nLooks good so far!\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Finding the Intersection of the Two Lines**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nNow, I need to find the point \\((x, y)\\) where the mouse\u2019s path intersects this perpendicular line. This point will be where the mouse is closest to the cheese.\n\n**Equations to Solve:**\n\n1. Mouse\u2019s Path:  \n   \\[\n   y = -5x + 18\n   \\]\n   \n2. Perpendicular Line:  \n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{38}{5}\n   \\]\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- **Method:** Set the two equations equal to each other to find \\(x\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n-5x + 18 = \\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{38}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis equation looks solvable. Let's proceed to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\):**\n\n1. **Eliminate Fractions:**  \n   Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   -25x + 90 = x + 38\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Rearranging Terms:**  \n   Bring all \\(x\\) terms to one side:\n   \\[\n   -25x - x = 38 - 90\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -26x = -52\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solving for \\(x\\):**  \n   Divide both sides by -26:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-52}{-26} = 2\n   \\]\n   \n**Check:**\n\n- **Division Check:** \\(-52 \u00f7 -26 = 2\\), which is correct.\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nI got \\(x = 2\\). This value seems reasonable. Now, let's find the corresponding \\(y\\)-coordinate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Finding the \\(y\\)-Coordinate of the Intersection Point**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nWith \\(x = 2\\), I can plug this back into either equation to find \\(y\\). Let's use the mouse's path equation for simplicity.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\ny = -5(2) + 18\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -10 + 18 = 8\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\n\nThe intersection point is \\((2, 8)\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does this point make sense? \n  - It lies on both the mouse's path and the perpendicular line.\n  - The coordinates \\((2, 8)\\) seem reasonable within the given ranges.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis point \\((2, 8)\\) should be where the mouse is closest to the cheese. It\u2019s on the mouse\u2019s path and satisfies both line equations.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nBefore concluding, it\u2019s essential to verify if this point indeed represents the mouse start getting farther from the cheese.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- **Idea:** Check the distance to the cheese before and after this point.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Distance Formula:**\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Distance from Cheese to Point \\((2, 8)\\):**\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(12 - 2)^2 + (10 - 8)^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{10^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 4} = \\sqrt{104} \\approx 10.2\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\nThis distance seems plausible. Now, let's see how the distance changes as the mouse continues along its path.\n\n3. **Checking a Point After \\((2, 8)\\):**\n   \n   Let\u2019s use \\(x = 3\\) to see if the distance increases:\n   \n   - **Calculate \\(y\\) when \\(x = 3\\):**\n     \\[\n     y = -5(3) + 18 = -15 + 18 = 3\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Point:** \\((3, 3)\\)\n   \n   - **Distance to Cheese:**\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{(12 - 3)^2 + (10 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{9^2 + 7^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 49} = \\sqrt{130} \\approx 11.4\n     \\]\n     \n**Check:**\n\n- **Comparison of Distances:**\n  - At \\((2, 8)\\): \\(d \\approx 10.2\\)\n  - At \\((3, 3)\\): \\(d \\approx 11.4\\)\n  \n- **Observation:** The distance increases from \\((2, 8)\\) to \\((3, 3)\\), confirming that \\((2, 8)\\) is indeed the point where the mouse starts getting farther from the cheese.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis verification solidifies that \\((2, 8)\\) is the correct point.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Calculating \\(a + b\\)**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThe problem asks for \\(a + b\\) at the turning point \\((a, b)\\). We\u2019ve determined that the turning point is \\((2, 8)\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\na + b = 2 + 8 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis addition is straightforward. The values \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 8\\) are consistent with our earlier findings.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** \n  - The coordinates \\((2, 8)\\) lie on the mouse\u2019s path.\n  - The sum \\(2 + 8 = 10\\) is a simple computation.\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nThroughout this problem:\n\n- **Brainstorming:** I started by listing potential strategies, settling on the algebraic approach as the most straightforward.\n- **Step-by-Step Exploration:** Each step involved defining and solving equations, ensuring the approach was correct before proceeding.\n- **Checking and Verifying:** After finding the intersection point, I verified that it was indeed where the mouse started getting farther from the cheese by comparing distances.\n\nBy reflecting often and adjusting the approach as needed, I ensured that the solution was accurate and methodical.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(a + b = 10\\)\n\nThis detailed, human-like thinking process captures the exploration and reflection necessary to solve the problem accurately.",

  "ground_truth": "The  point $(a,b)$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $(12,10)$ to the line $y=-5x+18$.  The perpendicular has slope $\\frac{1}{5}$, so its equation is \\[\ny=10+\\frac{1}{5}(x-12)=\\frac{1}{5}x+\\frac{38}{5}.\n\\]The $x$-coordinate at the foot of the perpendicular satisfies the equation \\[\n\\frac{1}{5}x+\\frac{38}{5}=-5x+18,\n\\]so $x=2$ and $y=-5\\cdot2+18=8$.
