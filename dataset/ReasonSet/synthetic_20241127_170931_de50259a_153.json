  "problem": "Henry's Hamburger Heaven offers its hamburgers with the following condiments: ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, tomato, lettuce, pickles, cheese, and onions. A customer can choose one, two, or three meat patties, and any collection of condiments. How many different kinds of hamburgers can be ordered?",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem step by step, just like how a human would naturally brainstorm and work through it. I'll capture my initial thoughts, brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and adjust my approach as needed. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at this problem, my immediate reaction is:\n\n**\"Okay, Henry's Hamburger Heaven offers hamburgers with a bunch of condiments and different numbers of meat patties. How many unique combinations can a customer order? This sounds like a combinatorics problem.\"**\n\nBut honestly, it's a bit overwhelming at first. There are so many condiments and options for patties.\n\n**\"Do I need to consider each condiment individually? What about the patties? Maybe I should list out all possible combinations... but that might take forever.\"**\n\nI think I need to explore different strategies to find the most efficient way to solve this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming Different Approaches:**\n\n1. **List All Possible Combinations:**  \n   **\"I could try to list every possible hamburger combination, but with eight condiments and up to three patties, that seems impractical. There must be a better way.\"**\n\n2. **Use the Multiplication Principle:**  \n   **\"Maybe I can multiply the number of options for patties by the number of condiment combinations. This sounds more manageable.\"**\n\n3. **Apply Combinatorics (Power Set):**  \n   **\"Since each condiment can either be included or not, this reminds me of the power set concept in combinatorics. That might work!\"**\n\n4. **Consider Binomial Coefficients:**  \n   **\"I could use binomial coefficients to calculate the number of ways to choose condiments.\"**\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**\"Listing all combinations is too time-consuming, so I'll try using combinatorics. Let's explore the second and third strategies.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring the Multiplication Principle**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n**\"Let's see if I can use the multiplication principle. I have three choices for patties (one, two, or three), and for each patty choice, there are multiple condiment combinations.\"**\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- **Number of Patty Choices:** 3 (one, two, or three patties)\n- **Condiment Combinations:** Need to calculate this separately\n\n**\"Wait a minute, I haven't figured out the condiment combinations yet. Let's focus on that first.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating Condiment Combinations Using the Power Set**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n**\"There are eight condiments, and each condiment can either be included or not. This sounds like a binary choice for each condiment, similar to calculating a power set.\"**\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**\"Yeah, this makes sense. Let's proceed with this idea.\"**\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- **Total Condiments:** 8\n- **Each condiment can be included or not:** 2 options per condiment\n- **Total Condiment Combinations:**  \n  \\(2^8 = 256\\)\n\n**\"Wait, but including no condiments at all might not make sense for a hamburger. Let's subtract that one case.\"**\n\n- **Valid Condiment Combinations:**  \n  \\(256 - 1 = 255\\) (excluding the case with no condiments)\n\n**Check:**  \n**\"Does this make sense? Yes, because having no condiments at all would still be a valid option, but if we want only combinations with at least one condiment, we need to subtract that case.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Combining Patty Choices with Condiment Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n**\"Now that I have the number of condiment combinations, I need to combine this with the patty choices. For each patty option, there are 255 valid condiment combinations.\"**\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- **Total Hamburger Combinations:**  \n  \\(3 \\text{ patty choices} \\times 255 \\text{ condiment combinations} = 765\\)\n\n**Check:**  \n**\"Wait, let's think about this. Does multiplying the patty choices by the condiment combinations cover all possibilities? Yes, because for each patty choice, all condiment combinations are available.\"**\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**\"This seems correct, but let's verify by considering different approaches to ensure consistency.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying with Binomial Coefficients**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n**\"Another way to verify is by using binomial coefficients to calculate the number of ways to choose different numbers of condiments.\"**\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Choose 0 to 8 condiments out of 8:**  \n  \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{8} \\binom{8}{k} = 256\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**\"But earlier, we excluded the case with no condiments, so we have 255 valid condiment combinations. This matches our previous calculation.\"**\n\n**Check:**  \n**\"Everything aligns so far. The total number of condiment combinations is 255 when excluding the no-condiment case.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Calculation and Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n**\"To ensure accuracy, let's break down the problem and recount the combinations.\"**\n\n- **Patty Choices:** 3 (one, two, or three patties)\n- **Condiment Combinations:** 255 (excluding no condiments)\n\n**Total Combinations:**  \n\\(3 \\times 255 = 765\\)\n\n**Verification:**  \n**\"Let's consider a simple example:**\n\n- **Single Patty with All Condiments:** 1 way\n- **Double Patty with No Condiments:** 1 way (though we excluded no condiments earlier)\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**\"Actually, I realize that excluding the no-condiment case only applies if we assume every hamburger must have at least one condiment. But if customers can choose no condiments, we should include that case.\"**\n\n**Adjustment:**  \n**\"So, including the no-condiment option, the total condiment combinations remain 256.\"**\n\n- **Total Hamburger Combinations:**  \n  \\(3 \\times 256 = 768\\)\n\n**Check:**  \n**\"Does this make sense? Yes, because for each patty choice, all 256 condiment combinations (including no condiments) are possible.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n**768 different kinds of hamburgers can be ordered.**  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \n**\"By exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying calculations, I've arrived at the correct answer. Initially, I considered excluding the no-condiment case, but upon reflection, I realized that all condiment combinations, including no condiments, should be included. This led to a total of 768 unique hamburger combinations.\"**\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**\"It's essential to continuously check and verify each step to ensure accuracy, especially in combinatorics problems where multiple variables are involved.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n1. **Initial Brainstorming:** Considered listing all combinations but found it impractical.\n2. **Explored Combinatorics:** Used the power set concept to calculate condiment combinations.\n3. **Applied Multiplication Principle:** Combined patty choices with condiment combinations.\n4. **Verification:** Used binomial coefficients to confirm condiment combinations.\n5. **Final Calculation:** Adjusted to include all condiment combinations, resulting in 768 total hamburger combinations.\n6. **Final Answer:** **768 different kinds of hamburgers can be ordered.**\n\nBy reflecting and verifying each step, I ensured that all possibilities were accounted for, leading to an accurate and complete solution.",
  "ground_truth": "A customer makes one of two choices for each condiment, to include it or not to include it. The choices are made independently, so there are $2^8 = 256$ possible combinations of condiments. For each of those combinations there are three choices regarding the number of meat patties, so there are altogether $(3)(256)=\\boxed{768}$ different kinds of hamburgers."
