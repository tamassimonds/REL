When I see \"square with an area of 81 square units,\" the first thing that comes to mind is that we're dealing with a square whose **side length is 9 units** (since \\( \\sqrt{81} = 9 \\)).\n\nThe question mentions \"quarter-circle arcs\" connecting points on adjacent sides. **Hmm**, this reminds me of problems involving **curved boundaries** within polygons. I recall working on similar problems where calculating the **perimeter** or **boundary length** was key.\n\nBut honestly, I'm **not entirely sure** how to approach this right away. I have a vague memory that involving both straight and curved segments could use a combination of lengths\u2014maybe adding linear and circular components together.\n\nLet me **brainstorm** a bit more:\n\n1. **Divide the Square's Sides**: Since each side is divided into 3 congruent parts, each segment would be \\( \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\) units.\n\n2. **Connecting Points with Arcs**: The quarter-circle arcs connect these points on adjacent sides. This makes me think about the **arc length** formulas.\n\n3. **Adding Linear and Curved Lengths**: Perhaps the boundary length is the sum of straight-line segments and arc lengths.\n\n**Reflection**: Does this make sense? I think so, but maybe I\u2019m oversimplifying. Before jumping in, let me visualize it: four quarter-circles at each corner and straight lines connecting these arcs. Okay, that seems reasonable.\n\n### **Step 1: Visualizing and Labeling the Figure**\n\n**Thought Process**: To understand better, I should **draw** or **mentally sketch** the figure. Visualizing will help confirm if my approach aligns with the actual shape.\n\n- **Square ABCD** with each side measuring 9 units.\n- **Points on Sides**:\n  - Let\u2019s name the points on side AB as P and Q.\n  - On side BC, R and S.\n  - On side CD, T and U.\n  - On side DA, V and W.\n\n- **Positions**:\n  - **P and Q** on AB, 3 units apart from each other.\n  - **R and S** on BC, similarly spaced.\n  - Continuing this pattern for sides CD and DA.\n\n- **Quarter-Circles**:\n  - Each arc connects two points on adjacent sides, centered at the corners of the square.\n\n**Reflection**: This makes the shape look like a square with rounded corners, specifically **fillets** or **chamfers**. I think I\u2019m on the right track now.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Length of Straight Segments**\n\n**Thought Process**: Let\u2019s start by finding the lengths of the straight segments that connect the endpoints of the quarter-circles.\n\n- **Connecting Points on AB**:\n  - **PQ** is a straight segment between P and Q on side AB.\n  - Since P and Q are 3 units apart, **PQ = 3 units**.\n\n- **Similarly** for sides BC, CD, and DA:\n  - According to the pattern, each straight segment connecting the points is also **3 units**.\n\n**Thinking Aloud**: Wait, that seems straightforward. Is it always 3 units because each side is divided into three equal parts? **Let me double-check**: Yes, \\( \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\). So, each connecting segment is 3 units.\n\n**Check**: So far, everything adds up. I can proceed with this.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Length of Quarter-Circle Arcs**\n\n**Thought Process**: Now, let\u2019s tackle the curved parts. Each corner has a **quarter-circle arc**. To find the total arc length, I need to know the radius of these arcs.\n\n- **Radius of Arcs**: Since each side is divided into 3 parts of 3 units each, and these arcs connect points on adjacent sides, the radius is **3 units**.\n\n- **Length of a Quarter-Circle**:\n  - The formula for the circumference of a circle is \\( C = 2\\pi r \\).\n  - For a quarter-circle, \\( L = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 2\\pi r = \\frac{\\pi r}{2} \\).\n\n- **Applying the Radius**:\n  - \\( L = \\frac{\\pi \\times 3}{2} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\) units for each quarter-circle.\n\n**Thinking Aloud**: Does this make sense? Yes, because the arcs are quarter-circles, and the radius matches the division of the square\u2019s sides.\n\n**Check**: So each quarter-circle arc is \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\) units long. Multiplying by 4 (since there are four corners), the total arc length is \\( 4 \\times \\frac{3\\pi}{2} = 6\\pi \\) units. This seems correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Adding Up the Total Boundary Length**\n\n**Thought Process**: Now, let's combine the lengths of the straight segments and the curved arcs to find the total boundary length.\n\n- **Total Length of Straight Segments**:\n  - There are four sides, each with a straight segment of 3 units.\n  - Total straight length = \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\) units.\n\n- **Total Length of Quarter-Circle Arcs**:\n  - As calculated, \\( 6\\pi \\) units.\n\n- **Total Boundary Length**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Length} = \\text{Straight Length} + \\text{Arc Length} = 12 + 6\\pi\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection**: This looks reasonable. So, the boundary length is **12 + 6\u03c0** units. To express it as a decimal to the nearest tenth, we\u2019ll plug in the value of \u03c0.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Decimal Value**\n\n**Thought Process**: Let\u2019s compute \\( 6\u03c0 \\) to add it to 12 and round the result to the nearest tenth.\n\n- **Using \u03c0 \u2248 3.14** (common approximation):\n\n  \\[\n  6\u03c0 \u2248 6 \\times 3.14 = 18.84\n  \\]\n\n- **Adding to Straight Length**:\n\n  \\[\n  12 + 18.84 = 30.84\n  \\]\n\n- **Rounding to Nearest Tenth**:\n\n  \\[\n  30.84 \u2248 30.8 \\text{ (to the nearest tenth)}\n  \\]\n\n**Check**: Does this seem plausible? Let me briefly think about the proportions. The square\u2019s side is 9 units, and the arcs cover significant but not overpowering portions relative to the straight sides. Adding 18.84 (for arcs) to 12 (for straight segments) results in 30.8, which seems reasonable.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nAt each step, I ensured that my calculations logically followed from one part to the next. By breaking down the problem into manageable components\u2014straight segments and circular arcs\u2014I could methodically arrive at the total boundary length. Checking intermediate values and reflecting on the approach helped catch any potential oversights early.\n\n**Final Answer**: The length of the boundary of the bolded figure is **30.8 units**.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the square has area 81 square units, it must have side length $\\sqrt{81}=9$ units (all number lengths will be in units henceforth). The boundary consists of four straight segments of length $9/3=3$ and four quarter-circle arc segments.  Notice how the four quarter-circle arc segments comprise a full circle of radius $3$; thus their total length is equal to that of the circumference of a circle of radius $3$, which is $6\\pi$.  The total length of the four straight segments is simply $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$.  Hence the total length of both type of segments is $6\\pi + 12$, which is approximately 30.84956.  To the nearest tenth, this value is $\\boxed{30.8}$."
