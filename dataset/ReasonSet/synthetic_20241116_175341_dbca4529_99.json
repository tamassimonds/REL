I'll explore different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n- **Given:** Two nonconstant geometric sequences \\( k, a_2, a_3 \\) and \\( k, b_2, b_3 \\) with different common ratios.\n- **Condition:** \\( a_3 - b_3 = 3(a_2 - b_2) \\).\n- **Goal:** Find the sum of the common ratios of the two sequences.\n\n**Initial Impressions:**\n\n- **Geometric Sequences:** I remember that in geometric sequences, each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. So, understanding how \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\) relate to their common ratios is crucial.\n- **Common Ratios:** We have two sequences with different common ratios. Maybe labeling them will help.\n- **Given Condition:** The relationship between \\( a_3 \\) and \\( b_3 \\) is tied to \\( a_2 \\) and \\( b_2 \\), which might reveal a connection between the common ratios.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Express Terms in Terms of Common Ratios:** Write \\( a_2 \\) and \\( a_3 \\) in terms of \\( k \\) and \\( r \\) (common ratio for sequence \\( a \\)), and similarly for \\( b \\) using \\( s \\).\n   \n2. **Set Up Equations Based on the Given Condition:** Use the relationship \\( a_3 - b_3 = 3(a_2 - b_2) \\) to create an equation involving \\( r \\) and \\( s \\).\n\n3. **Consider the Nature of Geometric Sequences:** Maybe there's a property of geometric sequences that simplifies the problem.\n\n**Possible Concerns:**\n\n- **Different Common Ratios:** Since the common ratios are different, I need to ensure that my equations reflect that correctly.\n- **Multiple Solutions:** There might be multiple pairs of common ratios that satisfy the condition.\n\n**Next Steps:** I'll start with the first strategy\u2014expressing the terms in each sequence in terms of their common ratios and setting up the equation based on the given condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expressing Terms in Terms of Common Ratios**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's define the sequences clearly. I'll label the common ratios for both sequences to avoid confusion. This should help set up the equations more neatly.\n\n**Defining the Sequences:**\n\n- **Sequence \\( a \\):** \\( k, a_2, a_3 \\)\n  - Let the common ratio be \\( r \\).\n  - Therefore:\n    - \\( a_2 = k \\cdot r \\)\n    - \\( a_3 = k \\cdot r^2 \\)\n\n- **Sequence \\( b \\):** \\( k, b_2, b_3 \\)\n  - Let the common ratio be \\( s \\).\n  - Therefore:\n    - \\( b_2 = k \\cdot s \\)\n    - \\( b_3 = k \\cdot s^2 \\)\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, each term is correctly defined by multiplying the previous term by the common ratio.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI think this is a good start because now I have expressions for \\( a_2, a_3, b_2, \\) and \\( b_3 \\) in terms of \\( k, r, \\) and \\( s \\). This should help in setting up the equation from the given condition.\n\n**Next Step:** Use the condition \\( a_3 - b_3 = 3(a_2 - b_2) \\) to create an equation involving \\( r \\) and \\( s \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have expressions for \\( a_3 \\) and \\( b_3 \\), and \\( a_2 \\) and \\( b_2 \\), I can substitute them into the given condition to relate \\( r \\) and \\( s \\).\n\n**Substituting the Expressions:**\n\nGiven:\n\\[ a_3 - b_3 = 3(a_2 - b_2) \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a_3 \\) and \\( b_3 \\):\n\\[ (k \\cdot r^2) - (k \\cdot s^2) = 3[(k \\cdot r) - (k \\cdot s)] \\]\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n\nFactor out \\( k \\) from both sides:\n\\[ k(r^2 - s^2) = 3k(r - s) \\]\n\nAssuming \\( k \\neq 0 \\) (since the sequences are nonconstant), we can divide both sides by \\( k \\):\n\\[ r^2 - s^2 = 3(r - s) \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks like a difference of squares on the left side. I remember that \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\). Maybe I can factor it that way.\n\n**Check:**\n\nBefore proceeding, let's see if factoring makes sense here. If I can factor the left side, it might help to simplify the equation and solve for \\( r \\) and \\( s \\).\n\n**Next Step:** Factor the left side and simplify the equation to find a relationship between \\( r \\) and \\( s \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Factoring the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's apply the difference of squares formula to the equation. This might make it easier to solve for \\( r \\) and \\( s \\).\n\n**Factoring the Left Side:**\n\nRecall:\n\\[ r^2 - s^2 = (r - s)(r + s) \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ (r - s)(r + s) = 3(r - s) \\]\n\n**Assuming \\( r \\neq s \\):**\n\nIf \\( r \\neq s \\), I can divide both sides by \\( r - s \\):\n\\[ r + s = 3 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, this implies that the sum of the common ratios \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) is 3, **but** only if \\( r \\neq s \\). This seems too neat. Let me think if this makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n**Possible Concern:**\n\n- **Assuming \\( r \\neq s \\):** The problem states that the sequences have different common ratios, so \\( r \\neq s \\) should be a valid assumption.\n- **But what if \\( r = s \\)?** In that case, the equation becomes \\( 0 = 0 \\), which doesn't help. Since the problem specifies that the sequences have different common ratios, \\( r = s \\) shouldn't happen.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this solution make sense with the given condition? If \\( r + s = 3 \\), then the sum of the common ratios is indeed 3. This aligns with the goal of the problem.\n\n**Next Step:** Assume \\( r \\neq s \\) and accept that \\( r + s = 3 \\) as the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify if this solution holds true by considering an example or checking if it satisfies the given condition.\n\n**Testing the Solution:**\n\nSuppose \\( r + s = 3 \\). Let's see if this satisfies the original condition.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\\[ (r - s)(r + s) = 3(r - s) \\]\n\nIf \\( r + s = 3 \\), then:\n\\[ (r - s)(3) = 3(r - s) \\]\n\\[ 3(r - s) = 3(r - s) \\]\n\nThis is always true, provided \\( r \\neq s \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe equation simplifies correctly, meaning our assumption \\( r + s = 3 \\) is consistent with the given condition.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this satisfy the given condition for **all** \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) where \\( r + s = 3 \\) and \\( r \\neq s \\)? Yes, because the equation reduces to an identity.\n\n**Next Step:** Confirm that assuming \\( r = s \\) leads to inconsistencies or trivial solutions, reinforcing that \\( r \\neq s \\) is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Confirming the Assumption \\( r \\neq s \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt's essential to ensure that the assumption \\( r \\neq s \\) is valid. Let's explore what happens if \\( r = s \\).\n\n**Exploring \\( r = s \\):**\n\nIf \\( r = s \\), the original equation simplifies to:\n\\[ (r - s)(r + s) = 3(r - s) \\]\n\\[ 0 = 0 \\]\n\nThis means that the equation holds for any \\( r = s \\). However, the problem states that the sequences have **different** common ratios, implying \\( r \\neq s \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis reinforces that \\( r = s \\) would contradict the problem's condition. Therefore, \\( r \\neq s \\) is a necessary assumption.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this confirm that \\( r + s = 3 \\) is the correct solution? Yes, because having \\( r = s \\) leads to no meaningful solution, while \\( r \\neq s \\) gives us \\( r + s = 3 \\).\n\n**Next Step:** Finalize the answer based on the valid assumption.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe sum of the common ratios of the two sequences is **3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully examining the problem, setting up equations based on the given condition, and verifying our assumptions, we determined that the sum of the common ratios \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) is **3**. Throughout the process, we reflected on each step, ensured that our approach was consistent with the problem's requirements, and confirmed that \\( r \\neq s \\) was a valid and necessary condition.",
