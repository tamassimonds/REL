    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, mimicking a human problem-solving process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2} + \\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-8)^2} = 20\n\\]\n\nI recognize this looks like the **definition of an ellipse**. In general, an ellipse can be defined as the set of points where the sum of the distances to two fixed points (the foci) is constant. So, I'm immediately thinking this is an ellipse centered around specific points with a constant distance sum.\n\nBut, to be sure, I recall that the standard form of an ellipse equation involves two squared terms added together, set equal to a constant. Here, we have two square root terms involving distances, which makes me think:\n\n1. **Is this really an ellipse?**\n2. **What are the foci?**\n3. **How do I find the distance between them?**\n\nI have a general idea that I need to identify the foci and then use properties of ellipses to find the distance between them, but I'm not entirely sure about the best starting point. Maybe I should verify that it's indeed an ellipse first.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Identify the foci directly from the equation.**\n   - This would involve recognizing the form of the equation and mapping it directly to the standard ellipse definition.\n\n2. **Rewrite the equation to match the standard form of an ellipse.**\n   - Manipulating the equation algebraically to see if it fits the standard ellipse equation.\n\n3. **Graphical interpretation.**\n   - Although not practical here, visualizing the graph could help understand the relationship between the foci and the constant sum.\n\n4. **Use properties of ellipses to relate the major and minor axes to the distance between foci.**\n   - Once the foci are identified, use known relationships in ellipses to find the distance.\n\nAt this point, **identifying the foci directly** seems like a good starting point because it aligns with the definition of the ellipse. If that doesn't work, I can try rewriting the equation.\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying the Foci**\n\nReflecting on the standard definition of an ellipse, it's the set of points where the sum of the distances to two fixed points (the foci) is constant.\n\nLooking at the given equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2} + \\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-8)^2} = 20\n\\]\n\nI can see that:\n\n- \\((x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2\\) represents the distance from the point \\((3, -4)\\).\n- \\((x+5)^2 + (y-8)^2\\) represents the distance from the point \\((-5, 8)\\).\n\nSo, it seems like the foci are at:\n\n- \\(F_1 = (3, -4)\\)\n- \\(F_2 = (-5, 8)\\)\n\n**Reflection:** Does this make sense? Given the structure of the equation, it aligns with the definition of an ellipse where the sum of distances to two points is constant. So, I think this part is correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Distance Between the Foci**\n\nNow that I have identified the foci, the next step is to find the distance between them. This is done using the distance formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the coordinates of \\(F_1\\) and \\(F_2\\):\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{((-5) - 3)^2 + (8 - (-4))^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(-8)^2 + (12)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{64 + 144}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{208}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = 4\\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- Wait a minute, does \\(4\\sqrt{13}\\) seem like a reasonable distance for the foci of an ellipse with a constant sum of distances equal to 20? \n\n- Quick check: Comparing \\(4\\sqrt{13} \\approx 14.42\\) to the total constant sum of 20, it seems plausible since the distance between the foci should be less than the constant sum.\n\n- However, let me double-check if this calculation aligns with the properties of an ellipse. For ellipses, the distance between foci \\(2c\\) relates to the major axis and minor axis, but since we only have the sum of distances, we can't directly relate it without more information.\n\nGiven that, I think calculating \\(d\\) as \\(4\\sqrt{13}\\) is correct based on the distance formula, even though it doesn't directly tie into the ellipse's parameters.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\nTo ensure the correctness of the approach, let's consider:\n\n- **Is the definition of the foci applied correctly?** Yes, the points from which the distances are measured are correctly identified as the foci.\n\n- **Is the distance formula applied correctly?** Yes, the distance between the identified foci is calculated correctly.\n\n- **Does the calculated distance make sense in the context of the ellipse?** Yes, while there isn't a direct relationship between the foci distance and the constant sum without more parameters, the calculated distance doesn't violate any ellipse properties.\n\n**Reflection:** The steps seem logical, and the calculations are correct. The distance \\(4\\sqrt{13}\\) makes sense given the constant sum of 20.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe distance between the foci of the ellipse is:\n\n\\[\n4\\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy identifying the foci directly from the equation and applying the distance formula, I was able to determine the distance between the foci as \\(4\\sqrt{13}\\). Throughout the process, I reflected on each step to ensure the approach was correct, making adjustments as needed to align with the properties of ellipses.\n\nThis step-by-step approach mirrors human problem-solving, involving brainstorming, reflecting, checking for correctness, and adjusting strategies to reach the final solution confidently.",

Therefore, the ellipse has foci $F_1$ and $F_2$, and so the answer is \\[F_1F_2 = \\sqrt{(3+5)^2 + (-4-8)^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + 12^2} = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{13}}.\\]"
