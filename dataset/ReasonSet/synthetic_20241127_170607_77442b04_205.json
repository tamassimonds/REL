  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like solving it on paper. We'll brainstorm strategies, reflect often, check our work, and adjust as needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nIf \\( f(x) = ax + b \\) and its inverse \\( f^{-1}(x) = bx + a \\), with \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) being real numbers, what's the value of \\( a + b \\)?\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\nHmm, this involves linear functions and their inverses. Usually, the inverse of a linear function has a specific form, but here, the coefficients \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are swapped in the inverse. This is intriguing!\n\n**First Instinct:**\n\nMaybe I can use the fundamental properties of functions and their inverses to set up equations involving \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Property of Inverses:**  \n   Apply \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\) and \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \\) to create equations.\n\n2. **Express the Inverse Explicitly:**  \n   Derive the inverse of \\( f(x) \\) and compare it to the given \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\n3. **Substitute Known Values:**  \n   Plug in specific values for \\( x \\) to see if relationships between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) emerge.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet's start with the **first strategy**\u2014using the property of inverses\u2014since it directly relates the function and its inverse. If that doesn't lead us anywhere, we'll explore the other options.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Inverse Property**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBy applying \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\), we should obtain an equation involving \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Compute \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) \\):**\n   - Given \\( f^{-1}(x) = bx + a \\),\n   - Substitute into \\( f(x) \\):\n     \\[\n     f(bx + a) = a(bx + a) + b = abx + a^2 + b\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Set it Equal to \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   abx + a^2 + b = x\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, this equation involves both \\( x \\) and constants. To satisfy it for all \\( x \\), the coefficients of \\( x \\) on both sides must be equal, and the constant terms must also match.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWe can break this down into two separate equations:\n\\[\nab = 1 \\quad \\text{(coefficient of } x\\text{)}\n\\]\n\\[\na^2 + b = 0 \\quad \\text{(constant terms)}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, because if \\( ab \\neq 1 \\), the equation wouldn't hold for all \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, we have two equations:\n1. \\( ab = 1 \\)\n2. \\( a^2 + b = 0 \\)\n\nWe need to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Expressing one variable in terms of the other seems like a good approach.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Express \\( b \\) in Terms of \\( a \\):**\n   \\[\n   ab = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = \\frac{1}{a}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute \\( b \\) into the Second Equation:**\n   \\[\n   a^2 + \\frac{1}{a} = 0\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Multiply Both Sides by \\( a \\) to Eliminate the Fraction:**\n   \\[\n   a^3 + 1 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Solve for \\( a \\):**\n   \\[\n   a^3 = -1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = -1\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Find \\( b \\) Using \\( b = \\frac{1}{a} \\):**\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are \\( -1 \\). Let's quickly verify if this satisfies both original equations.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Equation 1:**  \n  \\( ab = (-1)(-1) = 1 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  \n- **Equation 2:**  \n  \\( a^2 + b = (-1)^2 + (-1) = 1 - 1 = 0 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so it seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing the answer, let's double-check by substituting \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) back into the original functions to ensure everything aligns.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Original Function:**  \n   \\( f(x) = ax + b = -x - 1 \\)\n   \n2. **Given Inverse:**  \n   \\( f^{-1}(x) = bx + a = -x - 1 \\)\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Check \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\):**\n  \\[\n  f(f^{-1}(x)) = f(-x - 1) = -(-x - 1) - 1 = x + 1 - 1 = x\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \\):**\n  \\[\n  f^{-1}(f(x)) = f^{-1}(-x - 1) = -(-x - 1) - 1 = x + 1 - 1 = x\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth conditions \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\) and \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \\) are satisfied. This confirms that our solution is correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nEverything checks out, so I'm confident in the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that we've verified the solution, we can confidently state the value of \\( a + b \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\na + b = -1 + (-1) = -2\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{-2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically applying the properties of inverses, setting up equations, and solving them step by step, we've determined that \\( a + b = -2 \\). Along the way, we brainstormed different strategies, reflected on each step to ensure correctness, and verified the solution through substitution, which helped us confidently arrive at the correct answer.\n\n---\n\nThis approach allowed us to explore various methods, check for consistency, and adjust our strategy as needed, mimicking a natural problem-solving process.",
  "ground_truth": "Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$, it follows that $a(bx+a)+b=x$, which implies $abx + a^2 +b = x$. This equation holds for all values of $x$ only if $ab=1$ and $a^2+b=0$.\n\nThen $b = -a^2$.  Substituting into the equation $ab = 1$, we get $-a^3 = 1$.  Then $a = -1$, so $b = -1$, and  \\[f(x)=-x-1.\\]Likewise  \\[f^{-1}(x)=-x-1.\\]These are inverses to one another since  \\[f(f^{-1}(x))=-(-x-1)-1=x+1-1=x.\\]\\[f^{-1}(f(x))=-(-x-1)-1=x+1-1=x.\\]Therefore $a+b=\\boxed{-2}$."
