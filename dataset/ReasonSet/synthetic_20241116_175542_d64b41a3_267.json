    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking if my approach is correct, and making adjustments as needed. I'll think out loud, write down my thoughts, and ensure I explore various methods to arrive at the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**User Query:**\nFind \\( \\left \\lceil \\frac{12}{7} \\cdot \\frac{-29}{3} \\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{12}{7} \\cdot \\left \\lfloor \\frac{-29}{3} \\right \\rfloor \\right \\rfloor \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **Ceiling and Floor Functions:** I remember that the ceiling function \\( \\lceil x \\rceil \\) rounds up to the nearest integer, and the floor function \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\) rounds down. This is important to keep in mind while calculating.\n- **Multiplication Involved:** Multiplying fractions with negative numbers can be tricky. I need to ensure I handle the negatives correctly.\n- **Nested Floor Function:** There's a floor function within another expression. It might require evaluating the inner expression first, similar to order of operations.\n- **Maybe Simplify Step by Step:** Perhaps breaking it down into smaller parts will make it easier to manage and verify along the way.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Evaluate Innermost Expressions First:** Start by finding \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{-29}{3} \\right \\rfloor \\) since it's inside the second floor function.\n2. **Calculate Each Fraction Separately:** Compute \\( \\frac{12}{7} \\) and \\( \\frac{-29}{3} \\) individually before multiplying to avoid mental clutter.\n3. **Handle Ceiling and Floor Functions Sequentially:** After finding the products, apply the ceiling and floor functions as required.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Does this seem like a straightforward path? \n- I think starting with the innermost floor function makes sense to reduce complexity step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluate \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{-29}{3} \\right \\rfloor \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Begin by dividing \\(-29\\) by \\(3\\).\n- Since \\(-29\\) is negative, the floor function should round down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{-29}{3} = -9.6666...\n\\]\n**Applying Floor Function:**\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor -9.6666... \\right \\rfloor = -10\n\\]\n**Check:**\n- Is \\(-10\\) the correct floor value? \n- Yes, because \\(-10\\) is the largest integer less than or equal to \\(-9.6666...\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This part seems correct. The floor function properly rounds down the negative fraction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substitute Back into the Original Expression**\n\n**User Query Revisited:**\n\\[\n\\left \\lceil \\frac{12}{7} \\cdot \\frac{-29}{3} \\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{12}{7} \\cdot (-10) \\right \\rfloor\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, replace \\( \\frac{-29}{3} \\) with its floor value \\(-10\\) in the second term.\n- Proceed to calculate both terms separately.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Simplifying by substituting \\(-10\\) should make the calculations more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate \\( \\frac{12}{7} \\cdot \\frac{-29}{3} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Multiply the fractions directly.\n- Recall that multiplying a positive by a negative yields a negative result.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{7} \\cdot \\frac{-29}{3} = \\frac{12 \\times (-29)}{7 \\times 3} = \\frac{-348}{21}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{-348}{21} = -16.5714...\n\\]\n**Check:**\n- Does the fraction simplify correctly? \n- Yes, \\( \\frac{-348}{21} \\) simplifies to \\(-16.5714...\\), which seems accurate.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This step looks good. The multiplication and simplification are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Apply Ceiling Function to the First Term**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\left \\lceil -16.5714... \\right\\rceil = -16\n\\]\n**Thought Process:**\n- The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer.\n- Rounding \\(-16.5714...\\) up gives \\(-16\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Is \\(-16\\) the correct ceiling value? \n- Yes, because \\(-16\\) is greater than \\(-16.5714...\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems correct. The ceiling function is applied accurately.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate \\( \\frac{12}{7} \\cdot (-10) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, multiply \\( \\frac{12}{7} \\) by \\(-10\\) since we substituted \\(-10\\) earlier.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{7} \\cdot (-10) = \\frac{12 \\times (-10)}{7} = \\frac{-120}{7} = -17.142857...\n\\]\n**Check:**\n- Does the multiplication simplify correctly? \n- Yes, \\( \\frac{-120}{7} = -17.142857...\\), which matches the calculation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This step is accurate. The multiplication and simplification are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Apply Floor Function to the Second Term**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor -17.142857... \\right \\rfloor = -18\n\\]\n**Thought Process:**\n- The floor function rounds down to the nearest integer.\n- Rounding \\(-17.142857...\\) down gives \\(-18\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Is \\(-18\\) the correct floor value? \n- Yes, because \\(-18\\) is less than or equal to \\(-17.142857...\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems correct. The floor function is applied accurately.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Combine Both Terms to Find the Final Answer**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n-16 - (-18) = -16 + 18 = 2\n\\]\n**Thought Process:**\n- Subtract the floor value from the ceiling value.\n- Two negatives make a positive, so it's equivalent to adding \\(18\\) to \\(-16\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Does the arithmetic hold? \n- Yes, \\(-16 + 18 = 2\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This final step is correct. The arithmetic is straightforward and checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n- **Did It Work?** Yes, by systematically evaluating each part of the expression, applying the ceiling and floor functions correctly, and checking each step, I arrived at the correct answer.\n- **Was There Any Confusion?** Initially, the nested floor function seemed like it could complicate things, but addressing it first simplified the overall problem.\n- **Did I Need to Adjust My Approach?** No significant adjustments were needed. Following the order of operations and handling the floor and ceiling functions sequentially worked well.\n- **Could There Be an Easier Way?** Perhaps, but tackling the problem step by step ensured accuracy and made it manageable.\n- **Is the Answer Reasonable?** Yes, given the operations involved, an integer result makes sense, especially with negative fractions and mixed ceiling/floor applications.\n\nEverything checks out, and the approach was effective. The answer is confidently \\( \\boxed{2} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Evaluating the first term, $\\frac {12}7 \\cdot \\frac{-29}{3} = \\frac{-116}{7}$. Since $$-17 = \\frac{-119}{7} < \\frac{-116}{7} < \\frac{-112}{7} = -16,$$ the ceiling of $\\frac{-116}{7}$ is $-16$.\n\nIn the second term, since $$-10 = \\frac{-30}{3} < \\frac{-29}{3} < \\frac{-27}{3} = -9,$$ then the floor of $\\frac{-29}3$ is $-10$. The product of this with $\\frac{12}{7}$ is $\\frac{-120}{7}$. Since $$-18 = \\frac{-126}{7} < \\frac{-120}{7} < \\frac{-119}{7} = -17,$$ the floor of $\\frac{-120}{7}$ is $-18$. Hence, the answer is $-16 - (-18) = \\boxed{2}$."
