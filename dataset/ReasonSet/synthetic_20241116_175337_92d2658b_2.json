    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on whether each approach makes sense, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing directions if something doesn't seem right.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see that we're dealing with **square-free integers**. So, an integer \\( n \\) is square-free if **the only perfect square that divides \\( n \\) is \\( 1^2=1 \\)**. That means \\( n \\) shouldn't be divisible by any perfect square other than 1.\n\nThe specific task is to find how many **positive odd integers greater than 1 and less than 100** are square-free.\n\n#### **Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Odd Integers Between 1 and 100:** I need to consider all odd numbers from 3 to 99.\n- **Square-Free Condition:** I need to check which of these odd numbers are not divisible by any perfect square other than 1.\n\nMy initial thought is to list all odd integers between 3 and 99 and then filter out those that are **not** square-free by checking divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1 (like \\( 3^2 = 9, 5^2 = 25 \\), etc.).\n\nBut listing all and checking one by one seems tedious. Maybe there's a better method.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Listing and Checking:**\n   - **Pros:** Direct approach; straightforward.\n   - **Cons:** Time-consuming; prone to human error.\n\n2. **Using the Complement Principle:**\n   - **Idea:** Calculate the total number of odd integers between 3 and 99 and subtract those that are **not square-free**.\n   - **Pros:** Might be more efficient than listing each odd number and checking individually.\n   - **Cons:** Still requires identifying non-square-free numbers, but maybe easier overall.\n\n3. **Applying the M\u00f6bius Inversion Formula:**\n   - **Idea:** Use advanced number theory to count square-free numbers by considering the inclusion-exclusion principle with the **M\u00f6bius function**.\n   - **Pros:** Mathematically elegant and accurate.\n   - **Cons:** Overkill for a problem within a simple range; might be complicated without a deeper understanding.\n\n#### **Decision:**\nGiven the range is relatively small (3 to 99) and we're only dealing with odd numbers, the **Complement Principle** seems like a good middle ground. It allows us to calculate the required count without listing and checking each number individually.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Total Odd Integers Greater Than 1 and Less Than 100**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nFirst, I need to determine how many odd integers there are between 3 and 99.\n\n- **Range:** From 3 to 99, inclusive.\n- **Odd Numbers:** They form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \\( a = 3 \\) and the common difference \\( d = 2 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\nLet's find the number of terms \\( n \\) in this sequence.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Odd integers} = 3, 5, 7, \\ldots, 99\n\\]\n\nUsing the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\n\\[\na_n = a + (n-1) \\times d\n\\]\n\nSet \\( a_n = 99 \\):\n\n\\[\n99 = 3 + (n-1) \\times 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n99 - 3 = (n-1) \\times 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n96 = (n-1) \\times 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn-1 = \\frac{96}{2} = 48\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 48 + 1 = 49\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, there are **49 odd integers** between 3 and 99.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Non-Square-Free Odd Integers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNext, I need to find out how many of these odd integers are **not** square-free. An odd integer is **not square-free** if it is divisible by the square of an odd prime (since even squares would already be excluded by the oddness).\n\nList of odd primes whose squares are less than 100:\n- \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n- \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n- \\( 7^2 = 49 \\)\n- \\( 11^2 = 121 \\) (out of range)\n\nSo, we'll consider \\( 9, 25, \\) and \\( 49 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Multiples of 9:**\n   \\[\n   9, 27, 45, 63, 81, 99\n   \\]\n   Total: **6**\n\n2. **Multiples of 25:**\n   \\[\n   25, 75\n   \\]\n   Total: **2**\n\n3. **Multiples of 49:**\n   \\[\n   49\n   \\]\n   Total: **1**\n\n**Overlap Check:**\n- **Multiples of both 9 and 25:** \\( 9 \\times 25 = 225 \\) (out of range)\n- **Multiples of both 9 and 49:** \\( 9 \\times 49 = 441 \\) (out of range)\n- **Multiples of both 25 and 49:** \\( 25 \\times 49 = 1225 \\) (out of range)\n\n**Reflection:**\nThere are no overlaps within our range. So, the totals add up without any need for correction.\n\n**Totals:**\n- Multiples of 9: **6**\n- Multiples of 25: **2**\n- Multiples of 49: **1**\n- **Total non-square-free odd integers:** \\( 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 \\)\n\n### **Step 3: Using the Complement Principle to Find Square-Free Odd Integers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, to find the number of **square-free odd integers**, I subtract the number of non-square-free odd integers from the total number of odd integers.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Square-free odd integers} = \\text{Total odd integers} - \\text{Non-square-free odd integers}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Square-free odd integers} = 49 - 9 = 40\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, there are **40 square-free odd integers** greater than 1 and less than 100.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's quickly double-check the steps to ensure the accuracy of the result.\n\n- **Total Odd Integers Calculation:** Confirmed there are 49 odd integers from 3 to 99.\n- **Non-Square-Free Calculation:** Cross-verified the multiples of 9, 25, and 49:\n  - Multiples of 9: \\( 9, 27, 45, 63, 81, 99 \\) \u2014 Total **6**\n  - Multiples of 25: \\( 25, 75 \\) \u2014 Total **2**\n  - Multiples of 49: \\( 49 \\) \u2014 Total **1**\n- **No Overlaps Detected:** Ensured no number is counted multiple times.\n- **Final Calculation:** \\( 49 - 9 = 40 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The approach seems correct, and the numbers align logically.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThere are **40** positive odd integers greater than 1 and less than 100 that are square-free.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the Thought Process:**\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:** Considered listing, using the complement principle, and applying advanced number theory.\n- **Choosing the Best Approach:** Decided on the complement principle for efficiency.\n- **Step-by-Step Calculations:** Carefully calculated the total number of odd integers and identified non-square-free ones.\n- **Verification:** Double-checked each step to ensure accuracy.\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected frequently to confirm whether each step was correct and adjusted the approach as needed. This methodical checking ensured the final answer is reliable.",

  "ground_truth": "If an integer $n$ is not square-free, then there is a square greater than $1$ that does divide $n$. The odd squares less than $100$ are $3^2 = 9$, $5^2 = 25$, $7^2 = 49$, and $9^2 = 81$. If an integer is divisible by $81$, then it is divisible by $9$, so we will only consider $3^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$. There are $11$ multiples of $9$ that are less than $100$. Six of them are odd and five are even. There are $3$ multiples of $25$ that are less than $100$. Two of them are odd and one is even. There are $2$ multiples of $49$ that are less than $100$. One of them is odd and one is even. Therefore, there are $9$ odd integers that are not square-free. The least integer which is divisible by at least two of the integers 9, 25, and 49 is $9\\cdot 25 = 225$, which is greater than 100. Therefore, there are 9 odd integers less than 100 which are divisible by a perfect square greater than 1. There are $49$ odd integers less than $100$ and greater than 1, so there are $49-9=\\boxed{40}$ odd square-free integers less than $100$."
