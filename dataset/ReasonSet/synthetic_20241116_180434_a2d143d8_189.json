    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just as I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and be ready to adjust my approach if things don't seem right. Let's make this journey as authentic as possible, showcasing all the thought processes, uncertainties, and \"aha moments\" along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question:\n\n**\"Find the ones digit of the largest power of \\(2\\) that divides into \\((2^4)!\\)\"**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Okay, we're dealing with factorials and powers of 2. The ones digit usually relates to modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 10, since we're looking for the last digit.\n- **Brainstorming:** \n  - Maybe I can find out how many times \\(2\\) is a factor in \\((2^4)!\\). The more times \\(2\\) factors in, the higher the power of \\(2\\) that divides it.\n  - I recall there's a method to determine the highest power of a prime dividing a factorial\u2014using Legendre's formula or something similar.\n  - But wait, I also need to consider the ones digit of this highest power of \\(2\\). So perhaps after finding the power, I should see what \\(2^k\\) is modulo \\(10\\).\n- **Exploring Strategies:**\n  - **Strategy 1:** Use Legendre's formula to find the highest power of \\(2\\) in \\((2^4)!\\).\n  - **Strategy 2:** Once I have the power, compute the ones digit of \\(2^{\\text{that power}}\\) modulo \\(10\\).\n  - **Reflecting:** Does that make sense? Yes, because the ones digit of a number is determined by its remainder when divided by \\(10\\), and the highest power of \\(2\\) in the factorial will give us \\(k\\), so \\(2^k\\) will have its ones digit as \\(2^k \\mod 10\\).\n\nAlright, let's start with **Strategy 1**: Finding the highest power of \\(2\\) that divides \\((2^4)!\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate \\( (2^4)! \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- First, compute \\(2^4\\) to know which factorial we're dealing with.\n- **Calculation:** \n  \\[\n  2^4 = 16\n  \\]\n- **Reflection:** Okay, so we're working with \\(16!\\). That seems manageable for factorial-related calculations.\n\n**Check:** Does \\(16\\) make sense as the exponent? Yes, it's a power of \\(2\\), which aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Apply Legendre's Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Legendre's Formula** helps find the highest power of a prime \\(p\\) that divides \\(n!\\):\n  \\[\n  e_p(n!) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^i} \\right\\rfloor\n  \\]\n  - Here, \\(n = 16\\) and \\(p = 2\\).\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  e_2(16!) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{16}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{16}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{16}{8} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{16}{16} \\right\\rfloor\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15\n  \\]\n- **Reflection:** Wait, I need to consider higher powers of \\(2\\), but \\(\\frac{16}{32} = 0\\), so the summation stops here. \n\n**Check:** The highest power of \\(2\\) that divides \\(16!\\) is \\(15\\). That seems correct because each division by \\(2^i\\) counts how many times \\(2\\) is a factor in numbers up to \\(16\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Compute the Ones Digit of \\(2^{15}\\) Modulo \\(10\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now I need to find the ones digit of \\(2^{15}\\).\n- **Strategy:** Utilize the cyclical nature of the ones digits of powers of \\(2\\) modulo \\(10\\).\n- **Recall:** The ones digits of \\(2^n\\) repeat every four powers:\n  - \\(2^1 \\mod 10 = 2\\)\n  - \\(2^2 \\mod 10 = 4\\)\n  - \\(2^3 \\mod 10 = 8\\)\n  - \\(2^4 \\mod 10 = 6\\)\n  - Then it repeats: \\(2, 4, 8, 6, \\ldots\\)\n- **Calculation:** Since the cycle repeats every four exponents:\n  \\[\n  15 \\mod 4 = 3\n  \\]\n  - So, \\(2^{15} \\mod 10\\) aligns with \\(2^3 \\mod 10\\).\n  \\[\n  2^3 = 8\n  \\]\n- **Reflection:** This makes sense because the ones digits cycle through \\(4\\) unique values, and \\(15\\) falls in the same position as \\(3\\) within that cycle.\n\n**Check:** Let me quickly verify:\n  - Cycle: \\(2, 4, 8, 6\\)\n  - Position \\(3\\): \\(8\\)\n  - Yes, that aligns correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Confirm the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Does this method align with the problem's requirements?\n- We've determined that the highest power of \\(2\\) dividing \\(16!\\) is \\(15\\).\n- We found the ones digit of \\(2^{15}\\) by leveraging the cyclical pattern of powers of \\(2\\) modulo \\(10\\).\n- **Reflection:** Everything checks out. The approach is logical, and the calculations lead to a consistent result.\n\n**Check:** \n- Highest power of \\(2\\) in \\(16!\\): \\(15\\)\n- Ones digit of \\(2^{15}\\): \\(8\\)\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, because we've correctly applied mathematical principles and verified each step.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe ones digit of the largest power of \\(2\\) that divides into \\((2^4)!\\) is **8**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically:\n\n1. **Understand the Question:** Recognized the need to find the highest power of \\(2\\) in \\(16!\\) and its ones digit.\n2. **Brainstorm Strategies:** Considered using Legendre's formula and the cyclical pattern of \\(2^n \\mod 10\\).\n3. **Execute Step-by-Step:** Calculated the highest power and then the ones digit, checking and reflecting frequently.\n4. **Verify and Confirm:** Ensured each part of the process aligned with the problem's requirements, leading to a consistent final answer.\n\nThis step-by-step exploration, complete with checks and reflections, ensures a thorough and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We first need to find the largest power of $2$ that divides into $16! = 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times \\cdots \\times 2 \\times 1$. There are $8$ even numbers less than or equal to $16$, which contribute a power of $2^8$; of these, $4$ are divisible by $4$ and contribute an additional power of $2^4$; two are divisible by $8$ and contributes an additional power of $2^2$; and finally, one is divisible by $16$ and contributes an additional power of $2$. In total, the largest power of $2$ that divides into $16!$ is equal to $2^{8+4+2+1} = 2^{15}$.\n\nChecking the ones digits of the powers of $2$, we see that the ones digit of $2^1$ is $2$, of $2^2$ is $4$, of $2^3$ is $8$, of $2^4$ is $6$, and of $2^5$ is $2$. Thus, the ones digit will repeat every $4$ exponents, and the ones digit of $2^{15} = 2^{4 \\times 3 + 3}$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^3 = \\boxed{8}$."
