    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were working through it myself. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work frequently, and being open to adjusting my approach as needed. \n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nOkay, the problem involves five couples at a party where each person shakes hands with everyone else **except** their spouse and themselves. I must find out how many handshakes were exchanged in total. \n\nMy initial thought is that this seems like a combinatorial problem where we need to consider total possible handshakes and then subtract the ones that don't happen (i.e., handshakes with spouses).\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Strategy 1:** Calculate total handshakes if no restrictions, then subtract handshakes with spouses.\n- **Strategy 2:** Use a combination approach to directly calculate valid handshakes.\n- **Strategy 3:** Consider each couple and their handshakes individually.\n\nI'm leaning towards **Strategy 1** because it seems straightforward\u2014calculate the total possible handshakes and adjust for the exceptions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Total Possible Handshakes Without Restrictions**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf everyone could shake hands with everyone else, excluding themselves and their spouse, how would I calculate that?\n\n- **Total People:** There are 10 people (5 couples).\n- **Handshakes per Person:** Each person would shake hands with 10 - 1 (themselves) - 1 (their spouse) = 8 other people.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ \n\\text{Total Handshakes} = \\frac{10 \\times 8}{2} \n\\]  \n(We divide by 2 to avoid double-counting since a handshake involves two people.)\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Handshakes} = \\frac{80}{2} = 40 \n\\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, this seems too simple. Each couple is subtracted only once, but perhaps the spouses' handshakes are already accounted for in the total without restrictions. Let me think this through.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Reassessing the Calculation**\n\n**Realization:**  \nThe calculation assumes each person shakes hands with 8 others right off the bat. However, maybe I need to think about it differently because this might double-count or miss certain relationships.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nInstead of calculating total handshakes directly, **Strategy 2** suggests counting valid handshakes by considering combinations. Let me try that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Using Combinations to Count Valid Handshakes**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf we can't shake hands with our spouse or ourselves, how can I use combinations to find the total valid handshakes?\n\n- **Total People:** 10\n- **Handshakes per Person:** 8 (excluding themselves and their spouse)\n\nBut combinations usually deal with selecting pairs, so perhaps I can think about selecting 2 people out of 10, excluding couples.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nFirst, find the total number of ways to choose 2 people out of 10:\n\n\\[ \n\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45 \n\\]  \n\n**Next:**  \nSubtract the number of handshakes that **do not** occur, i.e., handshakes between spouses.\n\n- There are 5 couples, so 5 handshakes don't happen.\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Valid Handshakes} = 45 - 5 = 40 \n\\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis matches our initial calculation! But I\u2019m still unsure if approaching it this way is the best. It feels like I might be missing something, so let\u2019s check if both spouse-handshakes and double-counting are handled correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Ensuring No Double-Counting**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIn the combination approach, selecting a pair inherently considers each handshake only once. Since we subtracted the spouse handshakes after calculating all possible pairs, double-counting shouldn't be an issue.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n\\[ \n\\text{Total Handshakes Without Restrictions} = 45 \n\\]  \n\\[ \n\\text{Subtracted Spouse Handshakes} = 5 \n\\]  \n\\[ \n\\text{Valid Handshakes} = 45 - 5 = 40 \n\\]  \nThis makes sense. The total possible handshakes minus the handshakes that don't occur (spouse handshakes) gives us the correct number.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAfter exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and ensuring there's no double-counting or missing cases, I\u2019m confident in the answer.\n\n**Final Calculation:**  \n\\[ \n\\text{Total Valid Handshakes} = 40 \n\\]  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**40 handshakes were exchanged.**\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nInitially, I considered calculating total possible handshakes and subtracting the spouse handshakes directly. However, after realizing this might lead to confusion about double-counting, I switched to using combinations which provided a clearer path. Throughout the process, checking and reflecting ensured the approach was correct, leading to the consistent conclusion of **40 handshakes**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Mistakes and Adjustments:** At first, my straightforward calculation seemed too simplistic. Reflecting on it led me to reconsider double-counting, prompting a switch to the combination method, which clarified the solution.\n  \n- **Alternative Methods:** Another approach could have involved listing handshakes per couple and summing them up while skipping spousal handshakes, but that might be more tedious.\n\n- **Learning Point:** Always check if your initial approach accounts for all constraints, like excluding spouse handshakes, to avoid oversights.\n\nBy thinking through various strategies, reflecting frequently, and being willing to pivot when something doesn\u2019t feel right, I arrived at the correct solution.",
