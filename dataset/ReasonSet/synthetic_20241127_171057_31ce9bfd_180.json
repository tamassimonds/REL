  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by thinking it through just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, check my work along the way, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nLooking at the equation:\n\n\\[ \n5 = \\frac{x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x}{x + 2} \n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is that this involves a **rational expression** (a polynomial divided by another polynomial). It reminds me of problems where **factoring** or **simplifying** the expression could be useful. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start, so let's brainstorm some strategies.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Simplify the Equation:** Maybe I can multiply both sides by \\(x + 2\\) to get rid of the denominator.\n\n2. **Factor the Numerator:** Perhaps factoring \\(x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x\\) could help simplify the expression.\n\n3. **Use Polynomial Division:** Performing long division might simplify the rational expression.\n\n4. **Graphical Approach:** Visualizing the equation to find where the two sides are equal.\n\n*Let me start with the first idea\u2014simplifying the equation by eliminating the denominator\u2014and see if that leads anywhere.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify the Equation by Multiplying Both Sides**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI want to get rid of the denominator to work with a simpler equation. Let\u2019s multiply both sides by \\(x + 2\\):\n\n\\[ \n5(x + 2) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x \n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[ \n5x + 10 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis looks like a **cubic equation** now. That seems manageable, but I wonder if it can be factored easily. Let\u2019s try to bring everything to one side to set the equation to zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rearrange the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSubtract \\(5x + 10\\) from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[ \n0 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x - 5x - 10 \n\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[ \n0 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 \n\\]\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n\\[ \nx^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nNow I have a **cubic equation**. Cubics can be tricky, but maybe factoring or using the **Rational Root Theorem** could help. Let\u2019s explore factoring first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Attempt to Factor the Cubic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to factor \\(x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10\\). Factoring cubics isn't always straightforward, so I might look for possible **rational roots** using the Rational Root Theorem.\n\n**Possible Rational Roots:**\nAccording to the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (\\(-10\\)) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (\\(1\\)). So, the possible roots are:\n\n\\[\n\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 5, \\pm 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThat\u2019s a manageable list. I can test these values to see if any of them are actual roots. Let\u2019s start with \\(x = 1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Test \\(x = 1\\) as a Root**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nPlug \\(x = 1\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ \n1^3 - 2(1)^2 - 13(1) - 10 = 1 - 2 - 13 - 10 = -24 \n\\]\n\n**Outcome:**\n\\[ \n-24 \\neq 0 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, \\(x = 1\\) is not a root. Let\u2019s try the next possible root, \\(x = -1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Test \\(x = -1\\) as a Root**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nPlug \\(x = -1\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ \n(-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 - 13(-1) - 10 = -1 - 2 + 13 - 10 = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Outcome:**\n\\[ \n0 = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nAh, \\(x = -1\\) is a root! That\u2019s great because it means I can factor the cubic equation by dividing it by \\(x + 1\\). Let\u2019s proceed with **polynomial division**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Perform Polynomial Division**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince \\(x = -1\\) is a root, I can divide the cubic polynomial by \\(x + 1\\) to find the other factors.\n\n**Calculation:**\nLet\u2019s divide \\(x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10\\) by \\(x + 1\\) using **synthetic** or **long division**. I\u2019ll use synthetic division for simplicity.\n\n**Synthetic Division Steps:**\n\n1. Write down the coefficients: \n\\[ \n1, -2, -13, -10 \n\\]\n2. Use \\(x = -1\\) as the divisor.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n-1 & 1 & -2 & -13 & -10 \\\\\n   &   & -1 & 3 & 10 \\\\\n\\hline\n   & 1 & -3 & -10 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:**\nThe quotient is \n\\[ \nx^2 - 3x - 10 \n\\]\nwith a remainder of \n\\[ \n0 \n\\], which confirms the division is exact.\n\nSo, the original cubic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ \n(x + 1)(x^2 - 3x - 10) = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis is looking good! Now I have a **linear factor** and a **quadratic factor**. Next, I'll need to factor the quadratic to find the remaining roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Factor the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to factor \n\\[ \nx^2 - 3x - 10 \n\\]. Let\u2019s see if it can be factored easily or if I need to use the **quadratic formula**.\n\n**Attempt to Factor:**\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \n\\[ \n-10 \n\\] and add to \n\\[ \n-3 \n\\]. Hmm, let me think...\n\nWait, I don\u2019t see an obvious pair. Maybe factoring isn't straightforward here, so **I'll use the quadratic formula**.\n\n**Reflection:**\nSometimes quadratics don't factor nicely, so the quadratic formula is a reliable backup.\n\n**Calculation:**\nUsing the **quadratic formula**:\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \n\\]\n\nWhere \n\\[ \na = 1, \\, b = -3, \\, c = -10 \n\\]:\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-10)}}{2(1)} \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 40}}{2} \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{2} \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{3 \\pm 7}{2} \n\\]\n\n**Outcome:**\nThis gives us two roots:\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{3 + 7}{2} = 5 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{3 - 7}{2} = -2 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, the quadratic yields roots \n\\[ \nx = 5 \n\\] and \n\\[ \nx = -2 \n\\]. Combined with the linear root \n\\[ \nx = -1 \n\\], we have three roots in total.\n\nBut wait...\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Verify the Roots**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing the solution, it's important to verify that all the roots satisfy the original equation, especially since \n\\[ \nx = -2 \n\\] makes the denominator zero in the original equation. This could mean that \n\\[ \nx = -2 \n\\] is an **extraneous root**.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **For**\n   \\[ \n   x = -1 \n   \\]:\n   \\[\n   5 = \\frac{(-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 - 8(-1)}{-1 + 2} = \\frac{-1 - 2 + 8}{1} = \\frac{5}{1} = 5 \n   \\]\n   **Outcome:** Satisfied.\n\n2. **For**\n   \\[ \n   x = 5 \n   \\]:\n   \\[\n   5 = \\frac{5^3 - 2(5)^2 - 8(5)}{5 + 2} = \\frac{125 - 50 - 40}{7} = \\frac{35}{7} = 5 \n   \\]\n   **Outcome:** Satisfied.\n\n3. **For**\n   \\[ \n   x = -2 \n   \\]:\n   \\[\n   5 = \\frac{(-2)^3 - 2(-2)^2 - 8(-2)}{-2 + 2} = \\frac{-8 - 8 + 16}{0}\n   \\]\n   **Outcome:** Undefined (division by zero).\n\n**Reflection:**\nAha! That means \n\\[ \nx = -2 \n\\] is not a valid solution because it makes the denominator zero, leading to an undefined expression. So, \n\\[ \nx = -2 \n\\] is an **extraneous root** introduced during the factoring process.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Determine the Valid Roots**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nGiven that \n\\[ \nx = -2 \n\\] is not a valid root, the only solutions that satisfy the original equation are \n\\[ \nx = -1 \n\\] and \n\\[ \nx = 5 \n\\].\n\n**Valid Roots:**\n\\[ \nx = -1 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nx = 5 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nNow, I need to find the sum of these valid \n\\[ \nx \n\\]-values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Calculate the Sum of Valid \\(x\\)-Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSimply add the valid roots together to find the sum.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \n(-1) + 5 = 4 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems straightforward. But before finalizing, let me do a **quick sanity check** to ensure that everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nRe-evaluate each step to confirm that no mistakes were made. Ensure that all valid roots satisfy the original equation and that no extraneous roots are included in the sum.\n\n**Steps Review:**\n\n- **Simplifying the Equation:** Correctly transformed the original equation into a cubic equation.\n\n- **Finding Roots:** Successfully identified \n  \\[ \n  x = -1 \n  \\] and \n  \\[ \n  x = 5 \n  \\] as valid roots.\n\n- **Identifying Extraneous Root:** Correctly identified \n  \\[ \n  x = -2 \n  \\] as an extraneous root due to division by zero.\n\n- **Calculating the Sum:** Accurately added the valid roots to obtain the sum.\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The sum of the valid \n\\[ \nx \n\\]-values is indeed \n\\[ \n4 \n\\].\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER> \n4 \nsolution</ANSWER>\n\nThe sum of the \n\\[ \nx \n\\]-values that satisfy the equation \n\\[ \n5 = \\frac{x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x}{x + 2} \n\\] is **4**.\n\n---\n\nAlright, that wraps it up! By exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying the solutions, I ensured that the final answer is accurate. This approach mirrors how I would naturally tackle the problem, allowing for adjustments and validations throughout the process.",
  "ground_truth": "We can factor $x$ out of the numerator so that we're left with $$\\frac{x(x^2-2x-8)}{x+2}=\\frac{x(x-4)(x+2)}{x+2}$$After canceling out the $x+2$ from the numerator and denominator, we have $x(x-4)=5$.  Solving for the roots of a quadratic equation, we have $x^2-4x-5=0$, which gives us $(x-5)(x+1)=0$ and $x=5$ or $x=-1$. The sum of these values is $\\boxed{4}$, which is our answer.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum of the solutions for a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $-b/a$, the sum of the zeros of the quadratic $x^2-4x-5$ is $4/1=\\boxed{4}$."
