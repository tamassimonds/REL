To the nearest dollar, what is the positive difference between their balances?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into the problem, keeping the final answer intact but streamlining the thought process to create a more coherent and complete solution. I'll ensure it flows naturally, just like solving it on paper, while maintaining the original insights.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nCedric and Daniel each invest \\$12,000 for 15 years:\n\n- **Cedric:** Receives **5% compounded annually**.\n- **Daniel:** Receives **7% simple interest**.\n\n**Objective:**  \nDetermine the positive difference between their account balances after 15 years, rounded to the nearest dollar.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\n- **Compounded vs. Simple Interest:**  \n  I recall that compounded interest generally accumulates more over time compared to simple interest because interest is earned on both the principal and previously earned interest.\n\n- **Time Frame:**  \n  With a period of 15 years, the effects of compounding should be significant.\n\n- **Approach:**  \n  Calculate each account\u2019s final balance and then find the absolute difference.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Cedric\u2019s Balance with Compound Interest**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s start with Cedric\u2019s account using the compound interest formula.\n\n\\[\nA = P(1 + r)^n\n\\]\n\nWhere:  \n- \\( P = \\$12,000 \\)  \n- \\( r = 5\\% \\) or \\( 0.05 \\)  \n- \\( n = 15 \\) years  \n\n**Plugging in the Values:**\n\n\\[\nA = 12,000(1 + 0.05)^{15} = 12,000(1.05)^{15}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(1.05)^{15} \\approx 2.07893\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA \\approx 12,000 \\times 2.07893 \\approx 24,947.16\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe amount more than doubled, which aligns with expectations for compound interest over 15 years.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Daniel\u2019s Balance with Simple Interest**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let\u2019s calculate Daniel\u2019s balance using the simple interest formula.\n\n\\[\nA = P(1 + rt)\n\\]\n\nWhere:  \n- \\( P = \\$12,000 \\)  \n- \\( r = 7\\% \\) or \\( 0.07 \\)  \n- \\( t = 15 \\) years  \n\n**Plugging in the Values:**\n\n\\[\nA = 12,000(1 + 0.07 \\times 15) = 12,000(1 + 1.05) = 12,000 \\times 2.05\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nA = 12,000 \\times 2.05 = 24,600\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe final amount is just over double the principal, which makes sense for simple interest.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Positive Difference**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s find the difference between Cedric\u2019s and Daniel\u2019s balances.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 24,947.16 - 24,600 = 347.16\n\\]\n\n**Rounding to the Nearest Dollar:**\n\n\\[\n347.16 \\approx 347\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nRounding the difference ensures the final answer meets the problem\u2019s requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThe positive difference between Cedric\u2019s and Daniel\u2019s balances after 15 years is **\\$347**.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Compounded Interest Advantage:**  \n  Even with a lower interest rate, Cedric\u2019s compounded interest outperforms Daniel\u2019s higher simple interest rate over 15 years.\n\n- **Effective Strategy:**  \n  Calculating each balance separately using the appropriate formulas and then finding the difference proved successful.\n\n- **Importance of Reflection:**  \n  Regular checks after each step ensured accuracy and prevented errors.\n\nBy maintaining a methodical approach, the solution remains clear and accurate, highlighting the impact of different interest calculations over time.\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "We may find Cedric's balance by simply finding $\\$12,\\!000(1 + 0.05)^{15} \\approx \\$24,\\!947.14.$\n\nWe may find Daniel balance by finding $\\$12,\\!000(1 + 15 \\cdot 0.07) \\approx \\$24,\\!600.$\n\nTherefore, the difference between their balances is roughly $\\$24,\\!947.14 - \\$24,\\!600 \\approx \\boxed{\\$347}.$"
