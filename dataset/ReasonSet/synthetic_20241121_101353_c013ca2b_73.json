  "solution": "## **Complete Solution: Determining Angle \\(D\\) in a Convex Pentagon**\n\nLet's approach this problem methodically, mirroring a natural thought process. We'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, check our work, and ensure the correctness of our solution every step of the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have a convex pentagon \\(ABCDE\\) with the following properties:\n\n- Angles \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are congruent.\n- Angles \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) are congruent.\n- The measure of angle \\(A\\) is 40 degrees less than angle \\(D\\).\n\n**Objective:** Determine the measure of angle \\(D\\).\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\n- **Recall:** The sum of the interior angles of a polygon might be useful here.\n- **Idea:** Assign variables to the congruent angles and set up equations based on the total sum of angles.\n- **Check:** Ensure that the relationships between the angles are correctly represented.\n\nBut wait, do I remember the sum of interior angles for a pentagon correctly? Let me double-check.\n\n---\n\n### **Sum of Interior Angles**\n\nThe formula for the sum of interior angles of an \\(n\\)-sided polygon is \\((n-2) \\times 180\\) degrees.\n\n\\[\n\\text{For a pentagon } (n = 5):\\ (5 - 2) \\times 180 = 540\\ \\text{degrees}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Confirmation:** Yes, the total sum of all interior angles in a pentagon is 540 degrees.\n- **Utility:** This total will be crucial for setting up our equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies to Set Up Equations**\n\n**Strategy 1: Assign Variables to Angles**\n\n- **Let\u2019s assign:** \n  - Angles \\(A = B = C = x\\)\n  - Angles \\(D = E = y\\)\n- **Given:** \\(x = y - 40^\\circ\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- By expressing all angles in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we can create an equation using their sum to equal 540 degrees.\n- This approach should allow us to solve for \\(y\\), the measure of angle \\(D\\).\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**\n\n- **Check:** Assigning variables aligns with the congruency conditions and incorporates the given difference between angles \\(A\\) and \\(D\\).\n- **Proceed:** Seems logical, so let's move forward with this strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Setting Up the Equation**\n\nGiven that the sum of all interior angles is 540 degrees, we can write:\n\n\\[\nx + x + x + y + y = 540\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n3x + 2y = 540\n\\]\n\nBut we also know from the problem statement:\n\n\\[\nx = y - 40\n\\]\n\n**Substitution:**\n\nReplace \\(x\\) in the equation with \\(y - 40\\):\n\n\\[\n3(y - 40) + 2y = 540\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n3y - 120 + 2y = 540\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[\n5y - 120 = 540\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(y\\):**\n\n\\[\n5y = 540 + 120 = 660\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{660}{5} = 132\n\\]\n\n**Hmm...**\n\n- **Initial Result:** Angle \\(D\\) (which is \\(y\\)) comes out to be 132 degrees.\n- **Pause:** Let me think if this result makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- If \\(y = 132^\\circ\\), then:\n  \\[\n  x = y - 40 = 132 - 40 = 92^\\circ\n  \\]\n- Adding up all the angles:\n  \\[\n  3x + 2y = 3(92) + 2(132) = 276 + 264 = 540\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Confirmation:** The sum of the angles checks out perfectly, totaling 540 degrees.\n- **Validity:** This aligns with the total sum of interior angles for a pentagon.\n\n**But Let's Double-Check:**\n\n- **Convexity Check:** In a convex pentagon, all interior angles must be less than 180 degrees.\n- **Assessment:** Both \\(92^\\circ\\) and \\(132^\\circ\\) satisfy this condition.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Conditions Satisfied:**\n  - Angles \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are equal at 92 degrees.\n  - Angles \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) are equal at 132 degrees.\n  - Angle \\(A\\) is 40 degrees less than angle \\(D\\).\n\nEverything seems to fit perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Use Proportions**\n\n- **Idea:** Consider setting up a proportion based on the ratios of the angles.\n- **Reflection:** However, the variable assignment method already provided a straightforward solution.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- **Stick with Original Strategy:** Since the initial approach worked well and was efficient, there's no need to complicate the solution by introducing alternative methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{132^\\circ}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Approach:** By brainstorming and assigning variables based on the given congruencies, we set up an equation that led us directly to the solution.\n- **Verification:** Regular checks ensured the correctness of the approach and the final answer.\n- **Final Measure:** The measure of angle \\(D\\) is **132 degrees**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Effectiveness:** The strategy of assigning variables and using the sum of interior angles proved to be effective.\n- **Confidence:** Multiple checks confirmed the validity of the solution, ensuring that all conditions of the problem were satisfied.\n- **Simplicity:** Keeping the approach straightforward helped in arriving at the correct answer efficiently.\n\nThat's how I'd approach solving this problem, step by step, ensuring clarity and correctness at each stage.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the measure of $\\angle A$ be $x$, so we have $\\angle B = x$ and $\\angle C=x$, too. Since $\\angle A$ is $40^\\circ$ less than $\\angle D$, we have $\\angle D = x + 40^\\circ$, so $\\angle E = x+40^\\circ$.  The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we have \\[x + x + x + (x+40^\\circ) + (x+40^\\circ) = 540^\\circ.\\] Simplifying the left side gives $5x + 80^\\circ = 540^\\circ$, so $5x = 460^\\circ$ and $x = 92^\\circ$.  Therefore, $\\angle D = \\angle A + 40^\\circ = \\boxed{132^\\circ}$."
