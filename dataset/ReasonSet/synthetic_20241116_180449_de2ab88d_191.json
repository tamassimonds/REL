    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it just like I would if I were solving it myself, thinking through different strategies, checking my work along the way, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Here's how I'll start:\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n- **Understanding the Question:** \n  - We have three lines: \\( l_1 \\), \\( l_2 \\), and \\( l_3 \\).\n  - \\( l_1 \\): Goes through point \\( A = (-1, -2) \\) and has the equation \\( 3x - 2y = 1 \\).\n  - \\( l_2 \\): Horizontal line given by \\( y = 1 \\).\n  - \\( l_3 \\): Has a positive slope, goes through \\( A \\), and meets \\( l_2 \\) at point \\( C \\).\n  - The area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is 3.\n  - **Goal:** Find the slope of \\( l_3 \\).\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**\n  - **Finding Point \\( B \\):** Since \\( B \\) is where \\( l_1 \\) meets \\( l_2 \\), I could solve the system of equations for \\( l_1 \\) and \\( l_2 \\).\n  - **Determining Point \\( C \\):** \\( C \\) is where \\( l_3 \\) meets \\( l_2 \\). Since \\( l_3 \\) passes through \\( A \\) and \\( C \\), I can use the slope to find the coordinates of \\( C \\).\n  - **Calculating the Area of Triangle \\( ABC \\):** With points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) known, I can use the area formula for a triangle to set up an equation involving the slope of \\( l_3 \\).\n  - **Reflection:** This approach seems logical, but I'm not entirely sure if there are easier methods. Maybe using vector cross products or coordinate geometry tricks could simplify things.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Solving for Point \\( B \\) by Substitution:**\n   - Substitute \\( y = 1 \\) into the equation of \\( l_1 \\) to find \\( B \\).\n   \n2. **Using the Slope of \\( l_3 \\) to Find \\( C \\):**\n   - Since \\( l_3 \\) passes through \\( A \\) and \\( C \\), I can express the slope in terms of the coordinates of \\( C \\).\n\n3. **Applying the Area Formula for Triangle \\( ABC \\):**\n   - Use the determinant method to relate the area to the coordinates of \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\).\n   \n4. **Consider Vector Approaches:**\n   - Perhaps considering vectors from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) and \\( A \\) to \\( C \\), and checking their cross product magnitude to match the given area.\n\n- **Reflection:** I'll start with the first strategy, as it seems the most straightforward. If it gets too complicated or doesn't lead me to the answer, I'll reconsider and try another method.\n\n### **Step 1: Finding Point \\( B \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** \n  - \\( B \\) is where \\( l_1 \\) intersects \\( l_2 \\). So, I need to solve the system:\n    - \\( 3x - 2y = 1 \\)\n    - \\( y = 1 \\)\n    \n- **Calculations:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Substitute } y = 1 \\text{ into } 3x - 2(1) = 1:\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3x - 2 = 1 \\implies 3x = 3 \\implies x = 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:**\n  \\[\n  B = (1, 1)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** This seems correct. \\( B \\) is the point where \\( l_1 \\) and \\( l_2 \\) intersect. I'll move on.\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing the Slope of \\( l_3 \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - \\( l_3 \\) passes through \\( A(-1, -2) \\) and \\( C \\). Since the slope is positive, I can express the slope \\( m \\) as:\n    \\[\n    m = \\frac{y_C - (-2)}{x_C - (-1)} = \\frac{y_C + 2}{x_C + 1}\n    \\]\n    \n- **Reflection:** This expression for the slope makes sense. Now, I need to find \\( C \\) using \\( y = 1 \\) and the slope \\( m \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Finding Point \\( C \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - Since \\( C \\) lies on both \\( l_3 \\) and \\( l_2 \\), I can set \\( y_C = 1 \\).\n  - Substitute \\( y_C = 1 \\) into the slope formula to find \\( x_C \\):\n    \\[\n    m = \\frac{1 + 2}{x_C + 1} = \\frac{3}{x_C + 1}\n    \\]\n    - Rearranging gives:\n    \\[\n    x_C + 1 = \\frac{3}{m} \\implies x_C = \\frac{3}{m} - 1\n    \\]\n    \\]\n    \n- **Reflection:** This step assumes that the slope \\( m \\) is known. But since \\( m \\) depends on the coordinates of \\( C \\), I need to relate \\( m \\) back to the area of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Area of Triangle \\( ABC \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - The area of triangle \\( ABC \\) can be calculated using the determinant method:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B) \\right|\n    \\]\n  - Plugging in the known points:\n    - \\( A = (-1, -2) \\)\n    - \\( B = (1, 1) \\)\n    - \\( C = \\left( \\frac{3}{m} - 1, 1 \\right) \\)\n    \n- **Calculations:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (-1)(1 - 1) + (1)(1 - (-2)) + \\left( \\frac{3}{m} - 1 \\right)(-2 - 1) \\right|\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 3 + \\left( \\frac{3}{m} - 1 \\right)(-3) \\right|\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 3 - 3\\left( \\frac{3}{m} - 1 \\right) \\right|\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 3 - \\frac{9}{m} + 3 \\right|\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 6 - \\frac{9}{m} \\right| = 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Equation Setup:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 6 - \\frac{9}{m} \\right| = 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\left| 6 - \\frac{9}{m} \\right| = 6\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** At this point, I need to solve for \\( m \\). The absolute value equation can yield two cases. Let's solve for \\( m \\).\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Absolute Value Equation**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - The equation \\( \\left| 6 - \\frac{9}{m} \\right| = 6 \\) can be split into two cases:\n    1. \\( 6 - \\frac{9}{m} = 6 \\)\n    2. \\( 6 - \\frac{9}{m} = -6 \\)\n    \n- **Case 1:**\n  \\[\n  6 - \\frac{9}{m} = 6 \\implies -\\frac{9}{m} = 0 \\implies m = \\infty\n  \\]\n  \n- **Case 2:**\n  \\[\n  6 - \\frac{9}{m} = -6 \\implies -\\frac{9}{m} = -12 \\implies m = \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{3}{4}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** \n  - **Case 1:** \\( m = \\infty \\) doesn't make sense because \\( l_3 \\) is given to have a positive slope and finite value. Therefore, \\( m = \\infty \\) is invalid in this context.\n  - **Case 2:** \\( m = \\frac{3}{4} \\) is a valid solution.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** The slope of \\( l_3 \\) is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\n### **Step 6: Checking the Solution**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - It's essential to verify if the slope \\( m = \\frac{3}{4} \\) makes sense within the context of the problem, especially concerning the area of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n  \n- **Quick Check:**\n  - Recalculate the coordinates of \\( C \\):\n    \\[\n    x_C = \\frac{3}{\\frac{3}{4}} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    y_C = 1\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    C = (3, 1)\n    \\]\n    \n  - Recompute the area using the updated coordinates:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (-1)(1 - 1) + (1)(1 - (-2)) + (3)(-2 - 1) \\right|\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 3 + 3(-3) \\right|\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 3 - 9 \\right|\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 = 3\n    \\]\n    \n- **Result:**\n  - The area remains 3, which is consistent with the given information.\n  \n- **Reflection:** This confirms that the slope \\( m = \\frac{3}{4} \\) is correct. The solution checks out.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe slope of line \\( l_3 \\) is **\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Approach:** Started by identifying the intersection points and setting up the area formula for triangle \\( ABC \\). Solved for the slope of \\( l_3 \\) by handling an absolute value equation.\n  \n- **Checkpoints:** Throughout the process, I reflected on the correctness of each step, especially the validity of the slope solutions and the area calculation.\n\n- **Outcome:** By systematically solving for each unknown and verifying the conditions, I determined that the slope of \\( l_3 \\) is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).",
