    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking through it as naturally as possible\u2014just like I would if solving it on paper. I'll explore different strategies, reflect on their validity, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's brainstorm and see where it takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first read the question, several things come to mind:\n\n1. **Understanding the Requirements:**\n   - I need to find positive integers \\( a \\) where \\( a \\leq 50 \\).\n   - The quadratic equation \\( x^2 + (2a + 1)x + a^2 = 0 \\) must have two integer solutions.\n\n2. **Recalling Quadratic Knowledge:**\n   - This reminds me of properties related to quadratic equations having integer solutions.\n   - Maybe the discriminant needs to be a perfect square?\n\n3. **Possible Strategies:**\n   - Check the discriminant for being a perfect square.\n   - Maybe factor the quadratic equation if possible.\n   - Use Vieta's formulas to relate the roots to \\( a \\).\n   - Enumerate possible values of \\( a \\) and verify each case up to 50.\n\n4. **Initial Thoughts:**\n   - The discriminant approach seems straightforward since the condition for real and integer roots is that the discriminant is a perfect square.\n   - I'm not sure if factoring directly would help here, especially with the \\( 2a + 1 \\) term.\n   - Vieta\u2019s formulas might provide a different perspective, but let's start with the discriminant method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Discriminant Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For a quadratic equation \\( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\) determines the nature of the roots.\n- If \\( \\Delta \\) is a perfect square, the equation has integer solutions.\n\n**Applying to Our Equation:**\n\n- Given: \\( x^2 + (2a + 1)x + a^2 = 0 \\)\n- Here, \\( b = 2a + 1 \\) and \\( c = a^2 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (2a + 1)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times a^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 4a^2 + 4a + 1 - 4a^2 = 4a + 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- So, the discriminant \\( \\Delta \\) simplifies to \\( 4a + 1 \\).\n- For the quadratic to have two integer solutions, \\( 4a + 1 \\) must be a perfect square.\n\n**Initial Check:**\n\n- Perfect squares are numbers like \\( 0, 1, 4, 9, \\) etc.\n- So, \\( 4a + 1 \\) must equal one of these.\n\n**Possible Perfect Squares:**\n\n\\[\n4a + 1 = n^2 \\quad (\\text{where } n \\text{ is an integer})\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4a = n^2 - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{n^2 - 1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Constraint:**\n\n- \\( a \\) must be a positive integer and \\( a \\leq 50 \\).\n- Therefore, \\( n^2 - 1 \\) must be divisible by 4.\n\n**Checking Divisibility by 4:**\n\n- For \\( n^2 \\) to be \\( 1 \\mod 4 \\), \\( n \\) must be odd (since \\( n^2 \\mod 4 = 1 \\) only for odd \\( n \\)).\n\n**Identifying Valid \\( n \\):**\n\n- \\( n \\) must be an odd integer.\n- Calculate \\( a \\) for odd \\( n \\) such that \\( a \\leq 50 \\).\n\n\\[\nn = 1 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{1 - 1}{4} = 0 \\quad (\\text{Not valid since } a > 0)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 3 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{9 - 1}{4} = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 5 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{25 - 1}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 7 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{49 - 1}{4} = 12\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 9 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{81 - 1}{4} = 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 11 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{121 - 1}{4} = 30\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 13 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{169 - 1}{4} = 42\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 15 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{225 - 1}{4} = 56 \\quad (\\text{Exceeds 50, so stop here})\n\\]\n\n**List of Valid \\( a \\) Values:**\n\n- \\( a = 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42 \\)\n\n**Total Count:**\n\n- There are **6** values of \\( a \\) that satisfy the condition.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This seems to work because each \\( a \\) corresponds to an odd \\( n \\), ensuring \\( 4a + 1 \\) is a perfect square.\n- Since \\( a \\) must be a positive integer up to 50, and we've only found six valid \\( a \\) values, it aligns with the problem's constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Discriminant Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Before finalizing, I should verify that each calculated \\( a \\) indeed makes \\( 4a + 1 \\) a perfect square.\n- Also, it's good to ensure no other \\( a \\) values within the range were missed by this method.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- For each \\( a \\):\n\n  - \\( a = 2 \\): \\( 4(2) + 1 = 9 = 3^2 \\)\n  - \\( a = 6 \\): \\( 4(6) + 1 = 25 = 5^2 \\)\n  - \\( a = 12 \\): \\( 4(12) + 1 = 49 = 7^2 \\)\n  - \\( a = 20 \\): \\( 4(20) + 1 = 81 = 9^2 \\)\n  - \\( a = 30 \\): \\( 4(30) + 1 = 121 = 11^2 \\)\n  - \\( a = 42 \\): \\( 4(42) + 1 = 169 = 13^2 \\)\n\n- All computations confirm that \\( 4a + 1 \\) is indeed a perfect square for these \\( a \\) values.\n\n**Alternative Strategy Check:**\n\n- Could factoring the quadratic help? Let's consider:\n\n  - The quadratic is \\( x^2 + (2a + 1)x + a^2 = 0 \\).\n  - Factoring would mean finding two numbers that multiply to \\( a^2 \\) and add up to \\( 2a + 1 \\).\n  - However, given that \\( a \\) is defined in terms of perfect squares already, factoring might complicate things without adding value.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 2:**\n\n- The discriminant approach is valid and gives a correct and complete solution.\n- There's no need to complicate the problem with factoring or other methods since this one works efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Vieta's Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Vieta\u2019s formulas relate the coefficients of the quadratic to sums and products of its roots.\n- Maybe using these can provide a different perspective or verify our earlier approach.\n\n**Applying Vieta\u2019s:**\n\n- For the quadratic \\( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \\):\n  - Sum of roots \\( r_1 + r_2 = -b \\)\n  - Product of roots \\( r_1 \\times r_2 = c \\)\n\n- Given our equation:\n\n  - Sum of roots \\( r_1 + r_2 = -(2a + 1) \\)\n  - Product of roots \\( r_1 \\times r_2 = a^2 \\)\n\n**Insights:**\n\n- If both roots are integers, their sum and product must satisfy these equations.\n- However, directly applying Vieta\u2019s might not simplify the problem beyond what the discriminant approach provided.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- While Vieta\u2019s formulas are fundamental to understanding the relationships between roots and coefficients, in this case, they don't offer a new method or shortcut.\n- The discriminant approach already efficiently solved the problem.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- Stick with the discriminant method as it\u2019s straightforward and verifies the condition required for integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- After exploring different strategies, the discriminant approach proved to be the most effective.\n- Each \\( a \\) value found leads to \\( 4a + 1 \\) being a perfect square, satisfying the requirement for integer solutions.\n- Vieta\u2019s formulas, while insightful, didn\u2019t contribute additional value in this case.\n\n**Total Number of Valid \\( a \\):**\n\n- **6** values: \\( a = 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42 \\)\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- Each \\( a \\) makes \\( 4a + 1 \\) a perfect square.\n- All \\( a \\) are positive integers less than or equal to 50.\n- No \\( a \\) values were missed within the given range.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n- **There are 6 values of \\( a \\) that satisfy the given conditions.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- Throughout the process, it was essential to verify each step and ensure the method was appropriate.\n- Considering alternative strategies helped confirm the validity of the chosen approach.\n- Regular checks ensured no errors slipped through, leading to a reliable conclusion.\n\nBy thinking through it methodically and being open to adjusting the approach, the problem was resolved successfully.",

  "ground_truth": "If the quadratic equation $x^2 + (2a+1)x + a^2 = 0$ has two integer solutions, then $$x = \\frac{-2a-1 \\pm \\sqrt{(2a+1)^2 - 4a^2}}{2}$$is an integer, so it follows that the discriminant $(2a+1)^2 - 4a^2 = 4a + 1$ must be a perfect square. Also, $1 \\le a \\le 50$, so it follows that $5 \\le 4a+1 \\le 201$. Clearly $4a+1$ can only be the square of an odd integer; conversely, the square of any odd integer $(2n+1)^2$ is of the form $4n^2 + 4n+1 = 4(n^2 + n) + 1$ and so can be written as $4a+1$. The odd perfect squares from $5$ to $201$ are given by $9 = 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, 9^2, 11^2, 169 = 13^2$, so it follows that there are $\\boxed{6}$ such values of $a$."
