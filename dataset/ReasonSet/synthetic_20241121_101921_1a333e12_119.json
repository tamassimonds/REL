  "problem": "On Monday, Jessica told two friends a secret. On Tuesday, each of those friends told the secret to two other friends. Each time a student heard the secret, he or she told the secret to two other friends the following day. On what day of the week will 1023 students know the secret?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's work through this problem step by step, just as I would if I were solving it naturally. I'll brainstorm strategies, reflect on each step, check for correctness, and be open to changing my approach if needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, okay. Jessica tells two friends a secret, and then each person who knows the secret tells two more the next day. This feels like some sort of spreading or exponential growth problem. Kind of like those viral scenarios or maybe even how rumors spread.\n\nI'm thinking it might involve **geometric progressions** or perhaps even **binary trees** since each person tells exactly two others. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure yet. Let's explore.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Geometric Progression (GP):**  \n   Maybe the number of people who know the secret increases exponentially.\n\n2. **Binary Tree Visualization:**  \n   Each person branches out to two more, so it seems like a tree structure.\n\n3. **Simulating Day by Day:**  \n   Perhaps I can list out the number of people knowing the secret each day to see a pattern.\n\nI think I'll start with the **Geometric Progression** idea since it aligns with exponential growth. If that doesn't work, I can always switch to simulating day by day.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Geometric Progression**\n\n**Step 1:** Identify the Pattern  \nIf each person tells two others, then the number of new people each day doubles. It sounds like the total number of people who know the secret by the end of each day follows a geometric series.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute. On the first day, only Jessica knows. Then she tells two friends. But those two friends will each tell two more the next day, and so on. So, it's not just doubling\u2014it's more like each level adds more people.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, maybe it's not just a simple GP. Let's think about how many new people hear the secret each day and add them up.\n\n---\n\n### **Simulating Day by Day**\n\nMaybe listing it out will help clarify.\n\n- **Monday:** Jessica tells 2 friends.  \n  Total: 1 (Jessica) + 2 = 3\n\n- **Tuesday:** Each of the 2 friends tells 2 more.  \n  New people: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4  \n  Total: 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- **Wednesday:** Those 4 tell 2 each.  \n  New people: 4 \u00d7 2 = 8  \n  Total: 7 + 8 = 15\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, this is definitely growing quickly. Let's keep going to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n- **Thursday:**  \n  New people: 8 \u00d7 2 = 16  \n  Total: 15 + 16 = 31\n\n- **Friday:**  \n  New people: 16 \u00d7 2 = 32  \n  Total: 31 + 32 = 63\n\n- **Saturday:**  \n  New people: 32 \u00d7 2 = 64  \n  Total: 63 + 64 = 127\n\n- **Sunday:**  \n  New people: 64 \u00d7 2 = 128  \n  Total: 127 + 128 = 255\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, this is definitely following a pattern. But listing it out like this is time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Realization**\n\nWait! I see what's happening here. Each day, the number of new people is doubling. This does resemble a **binary tree**, where each node has two children.\n\nMaybe I can use that to find a formula instead of listing each day.\n\n**Idea:**  \nThe total number of people who know the secret by a given day is the sum of all the previous days' new people plus the originals.\n\n---\n\n### **Developing a Formula**\n\nLet's try to come up with a formula.\n\n- **Day 0 (Jessica):** 1  \n- **Day 1 (Monday):** 1 + 2 = 3  \n- **Day 2 (Tuesday):** 3 + 4 = 7  \n- **Day 3 (Wednesday):** 7 + 8 = 15  \n\n**Pattern Observed:**  \nTotal people = Previous total + New people  \nNew people = 2 \u00d7 Previous day's new people\n\n**General Formula:**  \n\\[ \\text{Total}_{n} = \\text{Total}_{n-1} + 2^{(n-1)} \\]  \nWhere \\( n \\) is the day number starting from Jessica as Day 0.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems to work. Let's test it for a few more days to be sure.\n\n- **Day 4 (Thursday):**  \n  Total = 15 + 16 = 31\n\n- **Day 5 (Friday):**  \n  Total = 31 + 32 = 63\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nYep, the formula holds. This will make it easier to calculate without listing each day.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying the Formula to Find the Target Day**\n\nOur goal is to find when the total number of people reaches 1,023.\n\nLet's continue using the formula:\n\n- **Day 6 (Saturday):**  \n  Total = 63 + 64 = 127\n\n- **Day 7 (Sunday):**  \n  Total = 127 + 128 = 255\n\n- **Day 8 (Monday):**  \n  Total = 255 + 256 = 511\n\n- **Day 9 (Tuesday):**  \n  Total = 511 + 512 = 1,023\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, we've reached exactly 1,023 on Day 9. But I need to check if this makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n**Check:**  \nAccording to the problem, each person tells two others the **next day**. So, the spreading happens the day after someone learns the secret.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nHmm, this aligns with our calculations. Jessica starts on Day 0, and by Day 9, we've reached 1,023 total.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet's verify by listing out the totals again to ensure no errors.\n\n- **Day 0 (Jessica):** 1  \n- **Day 1 (Monday):** 3 (1 + 2)  \n- **Day 2 (Tuesday):** 7 (3 + 4)  \n- **Day 3 (Wednesday):** 15 (7 + 8)  \n- **Day 4 (Thursday):** 31 (15 + 16)  \n- **Day 5 (Friday):** 63 (31 + 32)  \n- **Day 6 (Saturday):** 127 (63 + 64)  \n- **Day 7 (Sunday):** 255 (127 + 128)  \n- **Day 8 (Monday):** 511 (255 + 256)  \n- **Day 9 (Tuesday):** 1,023 (511 + 512)\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEverything checks out. The total reaches 1,023 on Day 9, which is **Tuesday**.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Final Solution</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThe secret will be known by 1,023 students on **Tuesday** of the second week.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, starting with geometric progression, and then simulating day by day, I was able to identify a pattern and develop a formula. Continuous reflection and checks ensured the correctness of the approach, leading to the final solution: Tuesday of the second week is when 1,023 students will know the secret.",
  "ground_truth": "On the first day, $1+2=3$ students know the secret.  On the second day, $1+2+4=7$ students know the secret.  On the third day, $1+2+4+8=15$ students know the secret.  Notice that each of these sums is one less than the next power of 2.  Therefore, on the $n$th day, $1+2+\\cdots+2^n=2^{n+1}-1$ students know the secret.  Setting $2^{n+1}-1=1023$, we find $2^{n+1}=1024\\implies n+1=10\\implies n=9$.  We counted Monday as the first day, so the eighth day is Monday and the ninth day is $\\boxed{\\text{Tuesday}}$.\n\nNote: To show that $1+2+\\cdots+2^n=2^{n+1}-1$, define the sum to be $s$ and multiply both sides of   \\[\ns=1+2+\\cdots+2^n,\n\\]by 2 to find \\[\n2s=2+4+\\cdots+2^{n+1}.\n\\]Subtract the first equation from the second to obtain $s=2^{n+1}-1$."
