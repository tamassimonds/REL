    "working_out": "### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We're given a cubic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 5x + 7 = 0\n\\]\n\nand we're told that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the roots of this equation. The goal is to find the **monic polynomial** whose roots are \\(a - 2\\), \\(b - 2\\), and \\(c - 2\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Shifting Roots:** The problem reminds me of polynomial root shifting. I recall that if you want to shift the roots of a polynomial by some constant, you can substitute \\(x\\) with \\(x + k\\) (where \\(k\\) is the shift value) to find the new polynomial. In this case, since we're shifting by \\(-2\\), it feels like I should substitute \\(x\\) with \\(x + 2\\).\n\n- **Using Vieta\u2019s Formulas:** Another approach is to use Vieta's formulas to relate the sums and products of the roots. This could help in verifying the coefficients later.\n\n- **Direct Expansion:** I could directly expand the shifted polynomial to find the new monic polynomial. But this might get messy, so I need to be careful.\n\n**Wait, let me think this through:**  \nDoes shifting by substituting \\(x + k\\) make sense here? Yes, since we're looking for roots shifted by \\(-2\\), substituting \\(x\\) with \\(x + 2\\) aligns with that. \n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this approach seem correct? It feels right because substituting \\(x + k\\) is a standard method for finding shifted roots. But let me see if there are any other strategies that might simplify the process.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nMaybe I could use Vieta\u2019s formulas to directly relate the coefficients after shifting, but I think substituting \\(x + 2\\) will give a clearer path.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet's go ahead with the substitution method: replacing \\(x\\) with \\(x + 2\\) in the original polynomial.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Substitute \\(x\\) with \\(x + 2\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If the roots \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) shift by \\(-2\\), then the new roots are \\(a - 2\\), \\(b - 2\\), and \\(c - 2\\).\n- To find the polynomial whose roots are these shifted values, I should substitute \\(x\\) with \\(x + 2\\) in the original polynomial equation.\n\n**Action:**\n\nSubstituting \\(x\\) with \\(x + 2\\) in the original equation:\n\n\\[\n(x + 2)^3 - 5(x + 2) + 7 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes this substitution cover the shift correctly? Yes, because replacing \\(x\\) with \\(x + 2\\) adjusts the roots by \\(2\\), which is what we need.\n\n**Check:**  \nBefore proceeding, let's think if there are any potential pitfalls here. One thing to watch out for is ensuring all terms are expanded correctly, especially the cubic part.\n\n**Ready to Proceed:**  \nAssuming the substitution is right, let's expand the equation step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expand \\((x + 2)^3\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Expanding \\((x + 2)^3\\) is the first step in simplifying the substituted equation.\n- I remember that the binomial theorem or multiplying step by step can be used here.\n\n**Option 1: Binomial Theorem**\n\nUsing the binomial expansion:\n\n\\[\n(x + 2)^3 = x^3 + 3(x^2)(2) + 3(x)(2^2) + 2^3 = x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8\n\\]\n\n**Option 2: Step by Step Multiplication**\n\nLet\u2019s multiply it out to verify:\n\n\\[\n(x + 2)(x + 2) = x^2 + 4x + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n(x^2 + 4x + 4)(x + 2) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 4x^2 + 8x + 4x + 8 = x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth methods give the same result. It's good to confirm the expansion is correct to avoid mistakes later.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes the expansion look correct? Yes, all terms match up.\n\n**Proceeding:**  \nWith the expansion verified, let's move on to the next term in the substituted equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Expand \\(-5(x + 2)\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I need to expand \\(-5(x + 2)\\).\n- This seems straightforward\u2014distributing \\(-5\\) across each term in the parentheses.\n\n**Action:**\n\n\\[\n-5(x + 2) = -5x - 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis part is simple, but it\u2019s important to handle the negative sign correctly to avoid errors.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs there anything tricky here? Just ensuring the signs are correct. Looks good.\n\n**Proceeding:**  \nNow, let's combine the expanded parts to form the new polynomial.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combine All Expanded Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need to add together the expanded \\((x + 2)^3\\), \\(-5(x + 2)\\), and the constant \\(7\\).\n- Keeping track of positive and negative signs is crucial here.\n\n**Action:**\n\nLet's combine them step by step:\n\n1. \\((x + 2)^3\\) expanded:  \n   \\[x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8\\]\n\n2. \\(-5(x + 2)\\) expanded:  \n   \\[-5x - 10\\]\n\n3. Constant:  \n   \\[+7\\]\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n\\[\n(x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8) + (-5x - 10) + 7\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\(x^3\\):  \n  \\[x^3\\]\n\n- \\(x^2\\):  \n  \\[6x^2\\]\n\n- \\(x\\):  \n  \\[12x - 5x = 7x\\]\n\n- Constant:  \n  \\[8 - 10 + 7 = 5\\]\n\nSo, the combined polynomial is:\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 6x^2 + 7x + 5 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks straightforward, but let me double-check the combining steps to ensure no mistakes.\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, did I subtract correctly?  \n- For the constant:  \n  \\[8 - 10 + 7 = 5\\]  \n  Yes, that's correct.\n\n**Proceeding:**  \nAssuming no mistakes in combining, the new polynomial is \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 7x + 5 = 0\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verify the Monic Polynomial**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The problem asks for a **monic** polynomial, which means the leading coefficient should be 1.\n- Our polynomial already has a leading coefficient of 1, so it qualifies as monic.\n- However, it's always good to verify if the transformation was done correctly by checking if the roots indeed shift by \\(-2\\).\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes substituting \\(x\\) with \\(x + 2\\) in the original polynomial accurately shift the roots by \\(-2\\)?  \nYes, because replacing \\(x\\) with \\(x + 2\\) means that each root \\(r\\) of the original polynomial becomes \\(r - 2\\), which is exactly the shift we're looking for.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis confirms that the substitution method was applied correctly.\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nThe polynomial \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 7x + 5 = 0\\) is indeed the monic polynomial whose roots are \\(a - 2\\), \\(b - 2\\), and \\(c - 2\\).\n\n**Final Check:**  \nDoes everything align?  \n- The substitution was correct.\n- The expansions were accurate.\n- The combination of terms was verified.\n- The leading coefficient is 1, making it monic.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe monic polynomial is:\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 6x^2 + 7x + 5 = 0\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Using Vieta\u2019s Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If I want to cross-validate the result, I could use Vieta\u2019s formulas.\n- Vieta\u2019s relates the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots.\n- By knowing the original polynomial's coefficients, I can see if the new polynomial's coefficients make sense after shifting the roots.\n\n**Action:**\n\nLet's apply Vieta\u2019s formulas to both polynomials.\n\n1. **Original Polynomial \\(x^3 - 5x + 7 = 0\\):**\n\n   - Sum of roots \\(a + b + c = 0\\)\n   - Sum of products of roots taken two at a time \\(ab + ac + bc = -5\\)\n   - Product of roots \\(abc = -7\\)\n\n2. **New Polynomial with roots \\(a - 2\\), \\(b - 2\\), \\(c - 2\\):**\n\n   - Sum of roots:  \n     \\((a - 2) + (b - 2) + (c - 2) = (a + b + c) - 6 = 0 - 6 = -6\\)\n\n     But in our new polynomial \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 7x + 5 = 0\\), the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is \\(6\\), which should represent \\(-\\) the sum of roots.  \n     So, \\(-(-6)\\) = \\(6\\), which matches.\n\n   - Sum of products of roots taken two at a time:  \n     \\[\n     (a - 2)(b - 2) + (a - 2)(c - 2) + (b - 2)(c - 2)\n     \\]\n     Expanding each term:\n     \\[\n     ab - 2a - 2b + 4 + ac - 2a - 2c + 4 + bc - 2b - 2c + 4\n     \\]\n     Combining like terms:\n     \\[\n     ab + ac + bc - 4(a + b + c) + 12 = -5 - 4(0) + 12 = 7\n     \\]\n     The coefficient of \\(x\\) in the new polynomial is \\(7\\), which matches.\n\n   - Product of roots:  \n     \\[\n     (a - 2)(b - 2)(c - 2) = abc - 2(ab + ac + bc) + 4(a + b + c) - 8\n     \\]\n     Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     -7 - 2(-5) + 4(0) - 8 = -7 + 10 - 8 = -5\n     \\]\n     The constant term in the new polynomial is \\(5\\), which matches the product.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUsing Vieta\u2019s formulas confirms that the coefficients of the new polynomial are consistent with the shifted roots.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes everything align with Vieta\u2019s?  \nYes, the sums and products match up perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBoth methods\u2014substituting \\(x + 2\\) in the original polynomial and verifying with Vieta\u2019s formulas\u2014lead to the same correct monic polynomial:\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 6x^2 + 7x + 5 = 0\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n**Final Check:**  \n- **Substitution Method:** Led us directly to the new polynomial through careful expansion and combination of terms.\n- **Vieta\u2019s Validation:** Provided an additional layer of verification, ensuring that the coefficients are correct after the root shift.\n\n**Does the answer make sense?**  \nAbsolutely. The transformation aligns with the problem's requirements, and both strategies yield consistent results.\n\n**Any lingering doubts?**  \nNope, everything checks out. The process was thorough, and alternate strategies confirmed the correctness.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe monic polynomial whose roots are \\(a - 2\\), \\(b - 2\\), and \\(c - 2\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x^3 + 6x^2 + 7x + 5 = 0}\n\\]",
