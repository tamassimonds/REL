  "solution": "Certainly! Let's tackle this problem step by step, mimicking a natural human thought process complete with brainstorming, reflections, and checks along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 + \\left(b + \\frac{1}{b}\\right)x + c = 0 \\]\n\nI notice that it\u2019s a quadratic in terms of \\( x \\). The coefficients involve both \\( b \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{b} \\), which feels a bit tricky. The question asks for finding a non-zero \\( c \\) such that there\u2019s exactly one positive \\( b \\) making the quadratic have exactly one solution.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- This reminds me of conditions for quadratics having a single solution, like using the **discriminant**.\n- But, given the involvement of \\( b \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{b} \\), maybe there\u2019s more to it.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Discriminant:** For a quadratic to have exactly one solution, the discriminant should be zero.\n2. **Analyze the Coefficients:** Explore relationships between \\( b \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{b} \\).\n3. **Symmetry Considerations:** Since \\( b \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{b} \\) are reciprocals, perhaps symmetry plays a role.\n4. **Graphical Interpretation:** Visualize how changing \\( b \\) affects the roots.\n\nI\u2019ll start with the **discriminant approach** since it\u2019s a direct method for ensuring a quadratic has exactly one solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Discriminant**\n\nFor a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant (\\( \\Delta \\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\]\n\nIf \\( \\Delta = 0 \\), the quadratic has exactly one (repeated) solution.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's apply this to our equation.\n- Identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) in our quadratic.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), the coefficient of \\( x \\) is \\( B = b + \\frac{1}{b} \\), and \\( c = c \\).\n\nSo, the discriminant becomes:\n\n\\[ (b + \\frac{1}{b})^2 - 4c = 0 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This simplifies the problem to an equation involving \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n- Solving this could give us a relationship between \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nLet's expand and simplify the discriminant equation:\n\n\\[ \\left(b + \\frac{1}{b}\\right)^2 - 4c = 0 \\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[ b^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} - 4c = 0 \\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[ b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} + 2 = 4c \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 4c = b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} + 2 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This gives us an expression for \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\).\n- Our goal is to find \\( c \\) such that there\u2019s exactly one positive \\( b \\) satisfying this equation.\n- It feels like we need to manipulate this equation to identify such a \\( b \\) and corresponding \\( c \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Introducing a Substitution to Simplify**\n\nLooking at the equation:\n\n\\[ b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This reminds me of the identity involving squares of reciprocals.\n- Perhaps substituting \\( t = b + \\frac{1}{b} \\) might help, since \\( t^2 = b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} + 2 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\n\\[ t = b + \\frac{1}{b} \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ t^2 = b^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} = t^2 - 2 \\]\n\nSubstituting back into our equation for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ 4c = (t^2 - 2) + 2 = t^2 \\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{t^2}{4} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This substitution seems helpful.\n- Now, we have \\( c \\) in terms of \\( t \\).\n- But remember, \\( t = b + \\frac{1}{b} \\), so we need to ensure \\( t \\) corresponds to a real \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Analyzing \\( t = b + \\frac{1}{b} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For real \\( b \\), \\( b + \\frac{1}{b} \\) has certain minimum values depending on \\( b \\)\u2019s sign.\n- Specifically, for positive \\( b \\), the minimum value of \\( b + \\frac{1}{b} \\) is 2 (achieved when \\( b = 1 \\)).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Therefore, \\( t \\geq 2 \\) for \\( b > 0 \\).\n- This means \\( c = \\frac{t^2}{4} \\geq 1 \\) since \\( t^2 \\geq 4 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This sets a lower bound for \\( c \\).\n- But the problem asks for a specific \\( c \\) where there\u2019s exactly one positive \\( b \\) resulting in one solution for the quadratic.\n- I need to think about how to pinpoint that exact value of \\( c \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Maybe I can express \\( t \\) in terms of \\( c \\) and see if there\u2019s a unique \\( b \\).\n- Alternatively, I can consider the behavior of the equation as \\( b \\) varies.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\n- Graphically interpret the relationship between \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n- Consider cases where \\( b \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{b} \\) are distinct versus when they are equal.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The substitution approach seems promising, but I need to ensure it leads to a unique solution.\n- Perhaps it\u2019s time to solve for \\( b \\) in terms of \\( c \\) and see what constraints arise.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Solving for \\( b \\) in Terms of \\( c \\)**\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{t^2}{4} \\]\n\nBut \\( t = b + \\frac{1}{b} \\), so:\n\n\\[ t^2 = \\left(b + \\frac{1}{b}\\right)^2 = b^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} \\]\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{b^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{b^2}}{4} \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This is a bit complicated. Maybe it\u2019s better to rearrange the equation to solve for \\( b \\) explicitly.\n- Let\u2019s multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[ 4c = b^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} \\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[ b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} = 4c - 2 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This looks cleaner.\n- Now, I need to find \\( b \\) such that this equation holds.\n- It might be helpful to introduce another substitution to simplify further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Introducing Another Substitution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let\u2019s set \\( u = b^2 \\). Then \\( \\frac{1}{b^2} = \\frac{1}{u} \\).\n- This substitution could turn the equation into a quadratic in terms of \\( u \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet \\( u = b^2 \\). Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ u + \\frac{1}{u} = 4c - 2 \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( u \\) to clear the fraction:\n\n\\[ u^2 + 1 = (4c - 2)u \\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[ u^2 - (4c - 2)u + 1 = 0 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Now I have a quadratic equation in terms of \\( u \\).\n- Solving this quadratic will give me \\( u = b^2 \\), and subsequently \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Solving the Quadratic for \\( u \\)**\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{(4c - 2) \\pm \\sqrt{(4c - 2)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 1}}{2} \\]\n\nSimplifying the discriminant:\n\n\\[ (4c - 2)^2 - 4 = 16c^2 - 16c + 4 - 4 = 16c^2 - 16c \\]\n\nSo the quadratic formula becomes:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{(4c - 2) \\pm \\sqrt{16c^2 - 16c}}{2} \\]\n\nFurther simplifying:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{4c - 2 \\pm 4\\sqrt{c^2 - c}}{2} \\]\n\nDividing everything by 2:\n\n\\[ u = 2c - 1 \\pm 2\\sqrt{c^2 - c} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This gives us two potential solutions for \\( u \\).\n- But we need to ensure that only one positive \\( b \\) (i.e., \\( u = b^2 > 0 \\)) exists for our desired \\( c \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Ensuring Exactly One Positive \\( b \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To have exactly one positive \\( b \\), the quadratic in \\( u \\) must have exactly one positive root.\n- This occurs when the discriminant of the quadratic is zero, meaning both roots coincide.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Set the discriminant to zero:\n\n\\[ 16c^2 - 16c = 0 \\]\n\n- Factor out:\n\n\\[ 16c(c - 1) = 0 \\]\n\n- Solving for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ c = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad c = 1 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- But the problem specifies that \\( c \\) must be non-zero, so \\( c = 0 \\) is not acceptable.\n- Therefore, \\( c = 1 \\) is the only valid solution.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Substituting \\( c = 1 \\) back into our earlier equations to ensure consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- It's crucial to verify that \\( c = 1 \\) indeed satisfies the original condition: exactly one positive \\( b \\) yielding one solution to the quadratic.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Original Equation:**\n\n   \\[ x^2 + \\left(b + \\frac{1}{b}\\right)x + 1 = 0 \\]\n\n2. **Discriminant Condition:**\n\n   \\[ \\left(b + \\frac{1}{b}\\right)^2 - 4 \\times 1 = 0 \\]\n\n   Simplifies to:\n\n   \\[ b^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} - 4 = 0 \\]\n\n   \\[ b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} = 2 \\]\n\n3. **Recall the Identity:**\n\n   \\[ b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} = 2 \\implies b + \\frac{1}{b} = \\pm 2 \\]\n\n   But since \\( b > 0 \\), we have:\n\n   \\[ b + \\frac{1}{b} = 2 \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( b \\):**\n\n   \\[ b + \\frac{1}{b} = 2 \\]\n\n   Multiplying both sides by \\( b \\):\n\n   \\[ b^2 + 1 = 2b \\]\n\n   \\[ b^2 - 2b + 1 = 0 \\]\n\n   \\[ (b - 1)^2 = 0 \\]\n\n   \\[ b = 1 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This confirms that when \\( c = 1 \\), there is exactly one positive \\( b \\) (namely, \\( b = 1 \\)) that makes the quadratic have exactly one solution.\n- **Wait...** This seems too straightforward. Let me double-check to ensure I\u2019m not missing anything.\n\n**Double-Check:**\n\n- By setting \\( c = 1 \\), the discriminant equation leads directly to \\( b = 1 \\).\n- Substituting back into the original quadratic, we get a perfect square, confirming a single repeated root.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The solution is consistent with the problem\u2019s requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final

discriminant method, so it was set aside.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The discriminant approach consistently led to progress, making it the preferred method.\n- Alternative strategies provided additional verification but weren\u2019t necessary for the final solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- While multiple strategies were considered, the discriminant method was the most efficient and direct way to solve the problem.\n- Verifying the solution through different perspectives ensured its correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Learning Points**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Discriminant as

  "ground_truth": "The discriminant of the given quadratic equation is $\\left(b+\\frac 1b\\right)^2 - 4c$. For the quadratic to have one root, it follows that the discriminant must be equal to zero, so $b^2 + 2 - 4c + \\frac 1{b^2} = 0$. We are also given that there should be exactly one positive value $b$ satisfying this equation. Multiplying through by $b^2$ (for we know that $b \\neq 0$) yields that $b^4 + (2-4c)b^2 + 1 = 0$; this is a quadratic equation in $b^2$ that has discriminant $(2-4c)^2 - 4$. Again, this discriminant must be equal to zero, so $(2-4c)^2 = 4 \\Longrightarrow 2-4c = \\pm 2$. The non-zero value of $c$ satisfying this equation is $c = \\boxed{1}$."
