  "solution": "---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nLet's dive into this problem step by step:\n\n> **Question:**  \n> If \\( f(x) = \\frac{x-3}{x-4} \\), then for what value of \\( x \\) is \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) undefined?\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**  \n- This is about **inverse functions**.  \n- To find where \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is **undefined**, I need to explore where the inverse function has issues.  \n- I'm thinking of different strategies: computing the inverse, examining where the original function is undefined, and maybe even graphing to visualize.\n\nHonestly, it's been a while since I tackled inverse functions, so I'm a bit fuzzy. Let's brainstorm and explore different approaches to ensure we get it right.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming Ideas:**  \n- **Compute \\( f^{-1}(x) \\):** Find the inverse and see where it's undefined.  \n- **Check \\( f(x) \\) Undefined Points:** See if the original function's undefined points affect the inverse.  \n- **Graphing:** Visualize the function to identify problematic areas.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which strategy will work best, so I'll start with the first one and adjust as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 1: Compute \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) and Identify Undefined Points**\n\n**Step 1:** Set Up the Inverse  \nStart by setting \\( y = f(x) \\):  \n\\[ y = \\frac{x-3}{x-4} \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Swap \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)  \nTo find the inverse, swap \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):  \n\\[ x = \\frac{y-3}{y-4} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow, I need to solve for \\( y \\) to express it in terms of \\( x \\). This will give me \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\n**Step 3:** Cross-Multiply to Eliminate Denominator  \n\\[ x(y - 4) = y - 3 \\]  \nExpanding:  \n\\[ xy - 4x = y - 3 \\]\n\n**Step 4:** Rearrange Terms to Isolate \\( y \\)  \nBring all terms involving \\( y \\) to one side:  \n\\[ xy - y = 4x - 3 \\]  \nFactor out \\( y \\):  \n\\[ y(x - 1) = 4x - 3 \\]  \nSolve for \\( y \\):  \n\\[ y = \\frac{4x - 3}{x - 1} \\]\n\n**Conclusion of Strategy 1:**  \nSo, the inverse function is:  \n\\[ f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{4x - 3}{x - 1} \\]\n\n**Next Step:**  \nIdentify where this inverse function is undefined.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 2: Determine Where \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) Is Undefined**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- A rational function is undefined where its **denominator is zero**.  \n- So, set the denominator of \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) to zero and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n**Step 1:** Set Denominator Equal to Zero  \n\\[ x - 1 = 0 \\]  \nSolving for \\( x \\):  \n\\[ x = 1 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This suggests that \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined at \\( x = 1 \\).  \n- But does this make sense? Let's double-check by considering the original function.\n\n**Check:**  \n- Does \\( x = 1 \\) have any special significance in \\( f(x) \\)?  \n- Let's plug \\( x = 1 \\) into \\( f(x) \\) to see what's happening.\n\n**Testing \\( x = 1 \\) in \\( f(x) \\):**  \n\\[ f(1) = \\frac{1-3}{1-4} = \\frac{-2}{-3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- \\( f(1) \\) is defined, but \\( f^{-1}(1) \\) is undefined.  \n- This aligns with our findings, but let's explore further to ensure there's no mistake.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Examine Where \\( f(x) \\) Cannot Be Inverted**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Consider where the **original function \\( f(x) \\)** is undefined, as this might impact the inverse.  \n- Also, think about any **restrictions** on \\( f(x) \\) that could affect \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\n**Step 1:** Identify Where \\( f(x) \\) Is Undefined  \n- \\( f(x) = \\frac{x-3}{x-4} \\) is undefined where the denominator is zero.\n\n**Set Denominator to Zero:**  \n\\[ x - 4 = 0 \\]  \n\\[ x = 4 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- So, \\( f(x) \\) is undefined at \\( x = 4 \\).  \n- But how does this relate to \\( f^{-1}(x) \\)?  \n- Perhaps \\( x = 4 \\) plays a role in the inverse function's behavior.\n\n**Check:**  \nLet's see what happens when \\( x = 4 \\) in the inverse function.\n\n**Testing \\( x = 4 \\) in \\( f^{-1}(x) \\):**  \n\\[ f^{-1}(4) = \\frac{4(4) - 3}{4 - 1} = \\frac{16 - 3}{3} = \\frac{13}{3} \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- \\( f^{-1}(4) \\) is defined, so \\( x = 4 \\) doesn't make \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) undefined.  \n- This suggests that the point where \\( f(x) \\) is undefined doesn't directly impact \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Validating the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- We've identified \\( x = 1 \\) as the value where \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined.  \n- But it's crucial to ensure that this is correct by considering the behavior of both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\n**Step 1:** Confirm that \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) Is Undefined at \\( x = 1 \\)  \n- The denominator of \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{4x - 3}{x - 1} \\) is zero when \\( x = 1 \\), making the function undefined.\n\n**Step 2:** Reflect on the Relationship Between \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f^{-1}(x) \\)  \n- Recall that the inverse function swaps the roles of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).  \n- Therefore, a point where \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined corresponds to a value of \\( x \\) where the inverse operation fails.\n\n**Step 3:** Consider Any Potential Errors or Oversights  \n- Given that our calculations consistently point to \\( x = 1 \\), it seems correct.  \n- However, it's always good to ask: \"Does this make sense within the context of the problem?\"\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Since \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined at \\( x = 1 \\) due to the denominator being zero, and no other issues arise, we can confidently state that **\\( x = 1 \\)** is the value where \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\( x = 1 \\)  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:** By exploring different strategies\u2014computing the inverse and examining where functions are undefined\u2014we ensured the correctness of our solution.  \n- **Validation:** Checking our work at each step helped catch potential errors early and confirmed the validity of our approach.  \n- **Conclusion:** Ultimately, identifying where the denominator of the inverse function is zero led us to the correct answer.\n\n**Closing Reflection:**  \nThis problem required careful consideration of both the original and inverse functions. By brainstorming and exploring multiple strategies, we thoroughly understood the relationship between \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f^{-1}(x) \\). Validating each step ensured the accuracy of our solution, leading us to confidently identify \\( x = 1 \\) as the point where \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\( x = 1 \\)",
  "ground_truth": "We start by finding the inverse function of $f$. By definition, we know that $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$, so $$\\frac{f^{-1}(x)-3}{f^{-1}(x)-4} = x.$$We can solve this equation for $f^{-1}(x)$. First we multiply both sides by $f^{-1}(x)-4$: $$f^{-1}(x)-3 = x\\cdot(f^{-1}(x)-4).$$Then we expand: $$f^{-1}(x)-3 = x\\cdot f^{-1}(x)-4x.$$Then we rearrange so as to group all terms involving $f^{-1}(x)$ on the left side: $$f^{-1}(x)-x\\cdot f^{-1}(x) = 3-4x.$$We can factor on the left side: $$f^{-1}(x)\\cdot (1-x) = 3-4x.$$Finally, we divide both sides by $1-x$ to obtain our inverse function, $$f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{3-4x}{1-x}.$$This function is defined for all $x$ except $\\boxed{1}$."
