  "solution": "### **Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were sitting down to solve it naturally.**\n\n---\n\n### **1. First Thoughts: What's the Problem Asking?**\n\n- **Okay, so the equation is \\((x-2)^{(25-x^2)} = 1\\).**\n- **I need to find how many integers \\(x\\) satisfy this equation.**\n  \n**Initial Reaction:**\n- Hmm, this looks like an exponent problem where both the base and the exponent involve \\(x\\). I\u2019ve dealt with similar problems before where making the exponent zero or the base one could simplify things.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n- Maybe I can set the exponent to zero because any number raised to the power of zero is one.\n- Or perhaps the base could be one since \\(1\\) raised to any power is still \\(1\\).\n- Wait a minute\u2014what about cases where the base is negative one and the exponent is even? That could work too.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Set the Exponent to Zero**\n\n- **Idea:** If \\(25 - x^2 = 0\\), then the exponent is zero, and anything raised to zero is \\(1\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n25 - x^2 = 0 \\implies x^2 = 25 \\implies x = \\pm 5\n\\]\n\n- **Possible Solutions:** \\(x = 5\\) and \\(x = -5\\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- For \\(x = 5\\): \\((5 - 2)^0 = 3^0 = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f  \n- For \\(x = -5\\): \\((-5 - 2)^0 = (-7)^0 = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Okay, this worked for \\(x = 5\\) and \\(x = -5\\).**  \n- But is that all the solutions? I feel like there might be more cases to consider.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Set the Base to One**\n\n- **Idea:** If \\(x - 2 = 1\\), then the base is \\(1\\), and \\(1\\) raised to any power is \\(1\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nx - 2 = 1 \\implies x = 3\n\\]\n\n- **Possible Solution:** \\(x = 3\\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- For \\(x = 3\\): \\((3 - 2)^{(25 - 9)} = 1^{16} = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Alright, \\(x = 3\\) works too.**  \n- Let me think if there are other bases that could make the equation equal to \\(1\\).\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Set the Base to Negative One with Even Exponent**\n\n- **Idea:** If \\(x - 2 = -1\\), then the base is \\(-1\\), and if the exponent is even, \\((-1)\\) raised to an even number is \\(1\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nx - 2 = -1 \\implies x = 1\n\\]\n\n- **Possible Solution:** \\(x = 1\\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- For \\(x = 1\\): \\((1 - 2)^{(25 - 1)} = (-1)^{24} = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **So far, I have four solutions:** \\(x = 5\\), \\(x = -5\\), \\(x = 3\\), and \\(x = 1\\).  \n- But wait, maybe there are more cases I haven't considered yet.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 4: Consider Other Integer Values**\n\n- **Thinking:** Let me test other integer values to see if they satisfy the equation. Perhaps there are more solutions I\u2019m missing.\n\n**Let's Try \\(x = 0\\):**\n\n\\[\n(0 - 2)^{(25 - 0)} = (-2)^{25} = -33,554,432 \\neq 1\n\\]\n\n- **Conclusion:** \\(x = 0\\) does not work.\n\n**Let's Try \\(x = 2\\):**\n\n\\[\n(2 - 2)^{(25 - 4)} = 0^{21}\n\\]\n\n- **Issue:** Oh, wait! Raising zero to any positive power is zero, not one. So, \\(x = 2\\) doesn\u2019t work.\n\n**What About \\(x = -3\\)?**\n\n\\[\n(-3 - 2)^{(25 - 9)} = (-5)^{16} = 1,525,878,906,250 \\neq 1\n\\]\n\n- **Conclusion:** \\(x = -3\\) doesn\u2019t work either.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **It seems like only the four solutions I found earlier work.**  \n- Let me think... Is there another approach to confirm this?\n\n---\n\n### **3. Alternative Approach: Analyzing the Equation**\n\n**Idea:**  \n- Maybe I can rewrite the equation to see all possible integer solutions more clearly.\n\n**Rewriting the Equation:**  \n\\((x - 2)^{(25 - x^2)} = 1\\)\n\n**Possible Cases:**\n1. The exponent is zero: \\(25 - x^2 = 0\\)\n2. The base is \\(1\\): \\(x - 2 = 1\\)\n3. The base is \\(-1\\) with an even exponent: \\(x - 2 = -1\\) and \\(25 - x^2\\) is even\n\n**Wait a Second\u2014**  \n- Are there any other cases where \\((x - 2)^{(25 - x^2)}\\) could equal \\(1\\)?  \n- **Thinking:** No, I think I've covered all possible scenarios where the equation equals \\(1\\).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Final Check: Confirming the Solutions**\n\n**Listing the Solutions Found:**\n- \\(x = 5\\)\n- \\(x = -5\\)\n- \\(x = 3\\)\n- \\(x = 1\\)\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n- **For \\(x = 5\\):**  \n  \\((5 - 2)^0 = 3^0 = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **For \\(x = -5\\):**  \n  \\((-5 - 2)^0 = (-7)^0 = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **For \\(x = 3\\):**  \n  \\((3 - 2)^{(25 - 9)} = 1^{16} = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **For \\(x = 1\\):**  \n  \\((1 - 2)^{(25 - 1)} = (-1)^{24} = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **It looks like these are indeed all the integer solutions.**  \n- **No other integer values satisfy the equation based on the strategies I\u2019ve applied.**\n\n---\n\n### **5. Conclusion: Stating the Final Answer**\n\n**<ANSWER> solution**  \n- **There are four integer solutions:**  \n  - \\(x = 5\\)  \n  - \\(x = -5\\)  \n  - \\(x = 3\\)  \n  - \\(x = 1\\)  \n**</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **By exploring multiple strategies\u2014setting the exponent to zero, the base to one, and considering negative bases with even exponents\u2014I was able to identify all integer solutions.**\n- **Testing additional integer values helped confirm that no other solutions exist.**\n- **Writing out each step and reflecting along the way ensured that the approach was correct and complete.**\n\n**Alright, that's it!**  \n- **Let me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to explore.**",
  "ground_truth": "We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \\pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\\boxed{4}$ integer solutions."
