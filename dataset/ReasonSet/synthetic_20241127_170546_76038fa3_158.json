There's no immediate constant pattern, suggesting that the ratio varies with \\(n\\). This indicates a deeper relationship that needs exploration.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Known Identities**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince small cases didn't reveal a clear pattern, let's consider known combinatorial identities involving binomial coefficients and their reciprocals.\n\n**Possible Identities:**\n\n- **Sum of Reciprocals:** There exists a known identity:\n  \\[\n  a_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{k}} = \\frac{2^n}{n+1}\n  \\]\n- **No Direct Identity for \\(b_n\\):** \\(b_n\\) doesn't immediately correspond to a well-known identity, so we'll need to derive it.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nKnowing \\(a_n = \\frac{2^n}{n+1}\\) is helpful. Now, the challenge is to find a similar closed form for \\(b_n\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Deriving a Closed Form for \\(b_n\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{a_n}{b_n}\\), we need an expression for \\(b_n\\). Let's explore different strategies to find this.\n\n**Strategies:**\n\n1. **Express \\(k\\) in Terms of Binomial Coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   k \\cdot \\binom{n}{k} = n \\cdot \\binom{n-1}{k-1}\n   \\]\n   This might help in transforming the sum.\n\n2. **Relate \\(b_n\\) to \\(a_n\\):** Look for a proportional relationship between \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\).\n\n3. **Use Symmetry Properties:** Utilize properties of binomial coefficients to simplify the sum.\n\n**Proceeding with Strategy 1:**\n\nLet's substitute the expression for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\nb_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{k}{\\binom{n}{k}} = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{n \\cdot \\binom{n-1}{k-1}}{\\binom{n}{k}} = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{n}{n-k} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSimplifying further leads to a complicated expression that's not immediately helpful. This suggests that Strategy 1 might not be the best path.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\nLet's try Strategy 2: establishing a relationship between \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Establishing a Relationship Between \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf we can express \\(b_n\\) in terms of \\(a_n\\), simplifying the ratio becomes straightforward. Let's explore this idea.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. **Recognize Proportionality:** Assume \\(b_n\\) is a multiple of \\(a_n\\).\n   \n2. **Find the Constant of Proportionality:** Determine the factor that relates \\(b_n\\) to \\(a_n\\).\n\n**Implementation:**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\nb_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{k}{\\binom{n}{k}}\n\\]\n\nNotice that:\n\n\\[\nb_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n k \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{k}}\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that \\(b_n\\) involves \\(k\\) times the terms in \\(a_n\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis still doesn't immediately reveal the relationship. Perhaps we need to consider symmetry properties of binomial coefficients.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Utilizing Symmetry Properties**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBinomial coefficients have symmetry: \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}\\). Let's see if this can help simplify \\(b_n\\).\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. **Split the Sum:** Consider splitting \\(b_n\\) into two parts based on symmetry.\n\n2. **Combine Similar Terms:** Use symmetry to combine terms and simplify the expression.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\nWe can write:\n\n\\[\nb_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{k}{\\binom{n}{k}} = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{n-k}{\\binom{n}{k}}\n\\]\n\nAdding these two expressions:\n\n\\[\n2b_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{k + (n-k)}{\\binom{n}{k}} = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{n}{\\binom{n}{k}} = n \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{k}} = n \\cdot a_n\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\nb_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot a_n\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is a significant breakthrough! It shows that \\(b_n\\) is directly proportional to \\(a_n\\), which makes simplifying \\(\\frac{a_n}{b_n}\\) straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Simplifying \\(\\frac{a_n}{b_n}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we have established:\n\n\\[\nb_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot a_n\n\\]\n\nWe can substitute this relationship into the ratio \\(\\frac{a_n}{b_n}\\).\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_n}{b_n} = \\frac{a_n}{\\frac{n}{2} \\cdot a_n} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{n}{2}} = \\frac{2}{n}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet's verify this by considering our earlier calculations for small \\(n\\):\n\n- **For \\(n = 1\\):** \\(\\frac{2}{1} = 2\\) \u2014 Matches!\n- **For \\(n = 2\\):** \\(\\frac{2}{2} = 1\\) \u2014 Matches!\n- **For \\(n = 3\\):** \\(\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\) \u2014 Matches!\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe simplified form \\(\\frac{2}{n}\\) aligns perfectly with our initial calculations for small \\(n\\). This confirms the correctness of our solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Final Solution:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a_n}{b_n} &= \\frac{a_n}{\\frac{n}{2} \\cdot a_n} \\\\\n                &= \\frac{2}{n}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**<ANSWER>**\n\n\\(\\frac{2}{n}\\)\n\n**</ANSWER>**\n\n**Recap and Reflection:**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Calculating small cases provided initial insights but didn't reveal a constant pattern, indicating the need for a deeper relationship.\n  \n- **Exploring Identities:** Recognizing the closed form for \\(a_n\\) helped in progressing towards the solution.\n  \n- **Symmetry Properties:** Leveraging the symmetry of binomial coefficients was crucial in establishing the proportional relationship between \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\).\n  \n- **Verification:** Consistently verifying the final solution against small cases ensured the correctness of the approach.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThe problem-solving process involved multiple strategies:\n\n1. **Calculating Small Cases:** Provided initial insights but required further exploration.\n2. **Identifying Known Identities:** Utilized a known identity for \\(a_n\\) to simplify the problem.\n3. **Establishing Proportional Relationships:** Symmetry properties of binomial coefficients led to a direct relationship between \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\).\n4. **Simplifying the Ratio:** With the proportional relationship, simplifying \\(\\frac{a_n}{b_n}\\) became straightforward.\n\nBy systematically exploring different approaches and verifying each step, we arrived at the correct simplification of \\(\\frac{a_n}{b_n}\\) as \\(\\frac{2}{n}\\).",
