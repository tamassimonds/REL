    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking if I'm on the right track, and adjusting my approach as needed. It\u2019s important to think out loud and explore various avenues to make sure we're getting closer to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + 2)^2}{y + z - 2} + \\frac{(y + 4)^2}{z + x - 4} + \\frac{(z + 6)^2}{x + y - 6} = 36\n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is that this looks like a problem involving symmetry or perhaps some kind of inequality or substitution. All variables are expressions that include both addition and squaring, which suggests that simplifying the numerators might be helpful.\n\nBut then I think: \"Wait, the denominators also involve combinations of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). This complicates things a bit.\" Maybe using specific values could help identify a pattern, but since we need the general ordered triple \\((x, y, z)\\), guessing might not be the best approach.\n\nAnother idea is to examine if there's a substitution that can simplify the terms. For instance, could substituting \\(x = a + 2\\), \\(y = b + 4\\), and \\(z = c + 6\\) help? But then, I remember that might complicate the equation further.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Substitution:** Attempting to simplify by substituting each variable with a related expression to eliminate the constants in the numerators.\n\n2. **Symmetry Consideration:** Looking for symmetric properties in the equation that could simplify the analysis.\n\n3. **Setting Variables Equal:** Assuming \\(x = y = z\\) to see if that leads to a valid solution or simplifies the problem.\n\n4. **Inequality Application:** Considering if inequalities like AM-GM might apply, though the equation is an equality.\n\n5. **Numerical Experimentation:** Trying out specific values greater than 3 to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n### **First Action: Substitution Attempt**\n\nLet's try the substitution idea. If we set:\n\n\\[\nx' = x + 2, \\quad y' = y + 4, \\quad z' = z + 6\n\\]\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x')^2}{y' - 2} + \\frac{(y')^2}{z' - 4} + \\frac{(z')^2}{x' - 6} = 36\n\\]\n\nBut then I realize that this doesn't help much because we still have different variables in the denominators. It might complicate things further. So, let's backtrack and try a different approach.\n\n### **Second Approach: Setting Variables Equal**\n\nAnother strategy is to assume that \\(x = y = z\\). This is often a good starting point in symmetric problems to see if such a condition can satisfy the equation. Let's denote \\(x = y = z = k\\), where \\(k > 3\\).\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(k + 2)^2}{k + k - 2} + \\frac{(k + 4)^2}{k + k - 4} + \\frac{(k + 6)^2}{k + k - 6} = 36\n\\]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(k + 2)^2}{2k - 2} + \\frac{(k + 4)^2}{2k - 4} + \\frac{(k + 6)^2}{2k - 6} = 36\n\\]\n\nNow, let's simplify each fraction:\n\n1. **First Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(k + 2)^2}{2k - 2} = \\frac{k^2 + 4k + 4}{2(k - 1)} = \\frac{k^2 + 4k + 4}{2k - 2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(k + 4)^2}{2k - 4} = \\frac{k^2 + 8k + 16}{2(k - 2)} = \\frac{k^2 + 8k + 16}{2k - 4}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(k + 6)^2}{2k - 6} = \\frac{k^2 + 12k + 36}{2(k - 3)} = \\frac{k^2 + 12k + 36}{2k - 6}\n   \\]\n\nNow, our equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k^2 + 4k + 4}{2k - 2} + \\frac{k^2 + 8k + 16}{2k - 4} + \\frac{k^2 + 12k + 36}{2k - 6} = 36\n\\]\n\nBut looking at this, I'm starting to feel that setting \\(x = y = z = k\\) might not be the right path. The fractions still involve \\(k\\) in a way that doesn't simplify easily to 36, especially with different denominators. So, let's reconsider our approach.\n\n### **Reflection and Realization**\n\nAt this point, attempting to set all variables equal doesn't lead to a straightforward path to the solution. The equation remains complex, and it's not clear how to proceed. This suggests that perhaps the variables are not all equal, or that another simplification method is needed.\n\nMaybe I need to look for relationships between the variables or see if there's a pattern that can be exploited. Alternatively, considering specific value assignments greater than 3 might help identify a viable solution.\n\n### **Third Approach: Numerical Experimentation**\n\nLet's try assigning specific values to \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) that are all greater than 3 to see if we can find a consistent pattern or a valid ordered triple.\n\n**Attempting with \\(x = 4\\), \\(y = 5\\), \\(z = 6\\):**\n\nLet's check if \\((4, 5, 6)\\) satisfies the equation.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n1. **First Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(4 + 2)^2}{5 + 6 - 2} = \\frac{6^2}{9} = \\frac{36}{9} = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(5 + 4)^2}{6 + 4 - 4} = \\frac{9^2}{6} = \\frac{81}{6} = 13.5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(6 + 6)^2}{4 + 5 - 6} = \\frac{12^2}{3} = \\frac{144}{3} = 48\n   \\]\n\nNow, add up the terms:\n\n\\[\n4 + 13.5 + 48 = 65.5\n\\]\n\nBut the right side of the equation is 36, not 65.5. This means that \\((4, 5, 6)\\) does not satisfy the equation.\n\n### **Wait, That Can't Be Right**\n\nHmm, so our initial guess isn't working. This suggests that the values need to be adjusted, or that perhaps the problem requires a more thoughtful approach rather than trial and error.\n\n### **Adjusting the Strategy**\n\nSince numerical experimentation didn't yield a correct solution immediately, let's consider another angle. Perhaps we can look for patterns or other relationships between the terms that can guide us toward the correct ordered triple.\n\n### **Fourth Approach: Using Symmetrical Properties**\n\nGiven that the equation is symmetrical with respect to \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), maybe there's a pattern involving arithmetic or harmonic means that can be applied here. However, applying means directly doesn't seem straightforward due to the squared terms and mixed variables in the denominators.\n\nBut then I remember another strategy: **Homogenization**. This involves making the equation homogeneous to simplify the relationships between the variables.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Homogenization**\n\nLet's attempt to homogenize the equation by finding a common factor or relationship among the terms. Since all terms add up to 36, maybe we can express each term as a fraction of 36.\n\nAssuming the equation can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{B} + \\frac{C}{D} + \\frac{E}{F} = 36\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) are all expressions involving \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), but this doesn't immediately simplify our problem.\n\nAt this point, I realize that creating a single homogeneous equation might be too complex without a clear path forward.\n\n### **Backtracking and Trying Another Method**\n\nSince homogenizing didn't lead to a clear solution, let's backtrack and consider the possibility of leveraging **Inequality Techniques**. Specifically, perhaps the **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality** could be useful here.\n\n### **Applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**\n\nRecall that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states:\n\n\\[\n(\\sum a_i b_i)^2 \\leq (\\sum a_i^2)(\\sum b_i^2)\n\\]\n\nHowever, applying this directly to our equation is tricky due to the squared terms and mixed variables. So, let's consider a scaled version of it.\n\nLet's multiply both sides of the equation by \\((y + z - 2)(z + x - 4)(x + y - 6)\\) to eliminate the denominators, assuming all denominators are positive (which they are since \\(x, y, z > 3\\)).\n\nThis would give us a much more complex equation:\n\n\\[\n(y + z - 2)(z + x - 4)(x + y - 6) \\left( \\frac{(x + 2)^2}{y + z - 2} + \\frac{(y + 4)^2}{z + x - 4} + \\frac{(z + 6)^2}{x + y - 6} \\right) = 36(y + z - 2)(z + x - 4)(x + y - 6)\n\\]\n\nBut looking at this, it's clear that multiplying across would make the equation vastly more complicated without necessarily simplifying it.\n\n### **Reflection and Realization**\n\nWait, this doesn't seem like the right path. Multiplying through doesn't simplify the problem but rather complicates it further. This suggests that perhaps the Cauchy-Schwarz approach isn't suitable here.\n\n### **Trying Another Angle: Assumption-Based Simplification**\n\nGiven that previous approaches haven't been fruitful, perhaps making an assumption about the relationships between \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) could help. For instance, maybe \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are in arithmetic progression or follow some other pattern.\n\nLet's see if assuming \\(x = y = z + d\\) where \\(d\\) is some constant could simplify the equation. However, this might still lead to complexity.\n\n### **Final Approach: Leveraging Symmetry and Solving for One Variable**\n\nConsidering the symmetry of the equation and the fact that all variables appear similarly, it's reasonable to assume that each variable contributes equally to the sum. Therefore, let's solve for one variable in terms of the others and see if a consistent relationship emerges.\n\nLet's solve the first term for \\(y + z - 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + 2)^2}{y + z - 2} = 4\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n(y + z - 2) \\cdot 4 = (x + 2)^2 \\implies y + z - 2 = \\frac{(x + 2)^2}{4}\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(y + z\\):\n\n\\[\ny + z = \\frac{(x + 2)^2}{4} + 2\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, solve the second term for \\(z + x - 4\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(y + 4)^2}{z + x - 4} = 13.5 \\implies z + x - 4 = \\frac{(y + 4)^2}{13.5}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(z + x\\):\n\n\\[\nz + x = \\frac{(y + 4)^2}{13.5} + 4\n\\]\n\nAnd for the third term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(z + 6)^2}{x + y - 6} = 48 \\implies x + y - 6 = \\frac{(z + 6)^2}{48}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x + y\\):\n\n\\[\nx + y = \\frac{(z + 6)^2}{48} + 6\n\\]\n\n### **Solving the System of Equations**\n\nNow we have three equations:\n\n1. \\( y + z = \\frac{(x + 2)^2}{4} + 2 \\)\n2. \\( z + x = \\frac{(y + 4)^2}{13.5} + 4 \\)\n3. \\( x + y = \\frac{(z + 6)^2}{48} + 6 \\)\n\nThis looks like a system of equations that can be solved simultaneously. However, given the complexity, perhaps we can look for a pattern or relationship that allows us to simplify it further.\n\nBut before diving deep into solving, I consider whether there's an easier way. Given the symmetry, perhaps assuming a specific form for the solution triplet could help.\n\n### **Assuming the Solution as a Multiple of a Base Triplet**\n\nLet's assume that the solution \\((x, y, z)\\) is a multiple of a base triplet that satisfies the equation, say \\((k, k + 2, k + 4)\\), where \\(k\\) is some value greater than 3.\n\nLet's check if this assumption holds:\n\n\\[\nx = k, \\quad y = k + 2, \\quad z = k + 4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(k + 2)^2}{(k + 2) + (k + 4) - 2} + \\frac{(k + 4)^2}{(k + 4) + k - 4} + \\frac{(k + 6)^2}{k + (k + 2) - 6} = 36\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n1. **First Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(k + 2)^2}{2k + 4 - 2} = \\frac{(k + 2)^2}{2k + 2} = \\frac{k^2 + 4k + 4}{2k + 2} = \\frac{k^2 + 4k + 4}{2(k + 1)} = \\frac{k + 2}{2} = \\frac{k}{2} + 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(k + 4)^2}{2k + 8 - 4} = \\frac{(k + 4)^2}{2k + 4} = \\frac{k^2 + 8k + 16}{2k + 4} = \\frac{k^2 + 8k + 16}{2(k + 2)} = \\frac{k + 4}{2} = \\frac{k}{2} + 2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(k + 6)^2}{k + 2 + k + 4 - 6} = \\frac{(k + 6)^2}{2k + 4 - 6} = \\frac{(k + 6)^2}{2k - 2} = \\frac{k^2 + 12k + 36}{2(k - 1)} = \\frac{k + 6}{2} = \\frac{k}{2} + 3\n   \\]\n\nAdding up the terms:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{k}{2} + 1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{k}{2} + 2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{k}{2} + 3\\right) = \\frac{3k}{2} + 6\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to 36:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3k}{2} + 6 = 36\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3k}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\nk = 20\n\\]\n\n### **Solution Found**\n\nSo, \\(k = 20\\). Therefore, the ordered triple is:\n\n\\[\n(x, y, z) = (20, 22, 24)\n\\]\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet's verify if \\((20, 22, 24)\\) satisfies the original equation.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n1. **First Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(20 + 2)^2}{22 + 24 - 2} = \\frac{22^2}{44} = \\frac{484}{44} = 11\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(22 + 4)^2}{24 + 20 - 4} = \\frac{26^2}{40} = \\frac{676}{40} = 16.9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(24 + 6)^2}{20 + 22 - 6} = \\frac{30^2}{36} = \\frac{900}{36} = 25\n   \\]\n\nAdding up the terms:\n\n\\[\n11 + 16.9 + 25 = 52.9\n\\]\n\nBut wait, the right side of the equation is 36, not 52.9. This suggests a miscalculation or inconsistency, which indicates that perhaps our assumption about the solution's form was incorrect, or that the multiple needs to be scaled differently.\n\n### **Reflection and Adjustment**\n\nHmm, our assumption led to \\(k = 20\\), but upon checking, the values don't satisfy the original equation. This suggests that perhaps the assumption needs to be adjusted, or that another factor needs to be considered.\n\nGiven the mistake, let's reconsider the approach. Maybe instead of assuming a multiple form, we need to consider a different relationship among \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Scaling and Adjustment**\n\nPerhaps the solution involves scaling the base triplet by a factor that we haven't accounted for. Let's see if scaling each term appropriately can lead us to a correct solution.\n\nLet's consider scaling the triplet by a common factor \\(k\\), but since \\(k = 20\\) led to an inconsistency, perhaps the scaling needs to be different or the assumption is incorrect.\n\nTo resolve this, let's revisit the substitution strategy but apply it more carefully to ensure consistency.\n\n### **Reapplying Substitution with Care**\n\nLet's try substituting \\(x = a + 2\\), \\(y = b + 4\\), and \\(z = c + 6\\) more methodically into the original equation to see if a consistent relationship can be established among the variables.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(a + 2 + 2)^2}{b + c - 2} + \\frac{(b + 4 + 4)^2}{c + a - 4} + \\frac{(c + 6 + 6)^2}{a + b - 6} = 36\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(a + 4)^2}{b + c - 2} + \\frac{(b + 8)^2}{c + a - 4} + \\frac{(c + 12)^2}{a + b - 6} = 36\n\\]\n\nAt this point, it seems that substitution doesn't lead to an immediate simplification. So, let's consider another substitution that directly relates the variables through their differences.\n\n### **Introducing Symmetry and Solving for Differences**\n\nLet's introduce new variables based on the differences:\n\n\\[\nu = y - x, \\quad v = z - y, \\quad w = x - z\n\\]\n\nThis would imply that:\n\n\\[\nx + u = y, \\quad y + v = z, \\quad z + w = x\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + 2)^2}{(x + u) + (x + v) - 2} + \\frac{(y + 4)^2}{(y + v) + x - 4} + \\frac{(z + 6)^2}{x + (x + u) - 6} = 36\n\\]\n\nBut looking at this, introducing differences complicates the substitutions and doesn't seem to simplify the problem meaningfully.\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Solution**\n\nGiven all the attempts and reflections, it seems that the earlier assumption about the solution being a simple multiple was incorrect. Therefore, let's return to the earlier approach where we assumed the variables could relate linearly but adjust for the inconsistencies observed.\n\nReturning to the base triplet assumption:\n\n\\[\n(x, y, z) = (k, k + 2, k + 4)\n\\]\n\nBut since \\(k = 20\\) led to inconsistency, but considering symmetry, perhaps the correct scaling needs to account for the offsets.\n\nLet's consider \\(x = k + m\\), \\(y = k + n\\), \\(z = k + p\\) where \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\) are constants. This would yield:\n\n\\[\n(x, y, z) = (k + m, k + n, k + p)\n\\]\n\nBut to satisfy the equation, \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\) must relate to each other in a specific way.\n\nGiven the symmetry and the requirement \\(m + n + p = 2\\) (since \\(m = 2\\), \\(n = 4\\), \\(p = 6\\)), perhaps:\n\n\\[\nm = m', n = m' + 2, p = m' + 4\n\\]\nwhere \\(m'\\) is an adjustment factor.\n\nBut since this leads to complexity without immediate solution, perhaps it's better to return to numerical experimentation but refine it.\n\n### **Refined Numerical Approach**\n\nLet's try to guess and check with a closer set of values.\n\n**Attempting with \\(x = 6\\), \\(y = 8\\), \\(z = 10\\):**\n\nLet's see if \\((6, 8, 10)\\) satisfies the equation.\n\n1. **First Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(6 + 2)^2}{8 + 10 - 2} = \\frac{8^2}{16} = \\frac{64}{16} = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(8 + 4)^2}{10 + 6 - 4} = \\frac{12^2}{12} = \\frac{144}{12} = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(10 + 6)^2}{6 + 8 - 6} = \\frac{16^2}{8} = \\frac{256}{8} = 32\n   \\]\n\nAdding up the terms:\n\n\\[\n4 + 12 + 32 = 48\n\\]\n\nBut the right side of the equation is 36, so this set does not satisfy the equation.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter multiple approaches and reflections, it seems that the earlier assumed solution \\((20, 22, 24)\\) doesn't satisfy the equation upon checking. This indicates that either the assumption was incorrect, or that an oversight occurred during the substitution or simplification process.\n\nGiven the complexity and the time spent, perhaps there's a simpler substitution or insight that hasn't been applied yet. However, without additional hints or a clearer path, the problem remains challenging.\n\nI'd recommend revisiting the substitution strategy or considering advanced techniques like leveraging specific theorems related to symmetrical equations, but that's beyond typical manual problem-solving steps.\n\n**Final Ordered Triple:**\n\nDespite the inconsistencies, the most likely ordered triple based on the numerical experimentation closest to the requirement is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{(20, 22, 24)}\\)\n\nBut I'd advise double-checking this against the original equation to ensure correctness, as there seem to be discrepancies.\n\nAhh, I see I've made a mistake in my previous solution. Let's take a step back and re-evaluate the problem, just like I'd do if I were trying to solve it manually. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to check if I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed. It's important to think out loud, explore various methods, and pivot when something doesn't work. Let's dive back into it.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting the Problem**\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + 2)^2}{y + z - 2} + \\frac{(y + 4)^2}{z + x - 4} + \\frac{(z + 6)^2}{x + y - 6} = 36\n\\]\n\nwith the constraints that \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are all real numbers greater than 3.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first saw this problem, I thought it looked familiar\u2014perhaps similar to problems involving symmetry or specific techniques like Cauchy-Schwarz. However, my initial attempt led me down a complex path that didn't yield the correct solution. This suggests I might have overcomplicated things or made an incorrect assumption.\n\n**Brainstorming Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Substitution:** Trying to simplify the equation by substituting each variable with a related expression.\n   \n2. **Setting Variables Equal:** Assuming \\(x = y = z\\) to see if that leads to a valid solution.\n\n3. **Numerical Experimentation:** Testing specific values greater than 3 to find a potential solution.\n\n4. **Inequality Application:** Considering if inequalities like AM-GM might apply, though the equation is an equality.\n\n5. **Using Symmetry:** Leveraging the symmetric nature of the equation to simplify.\n\n**Reflecting on My Previous Approach:**\n\nInitially, I attempted to set all variables equal, assuming \\(x = y = z = k\\). However, this led to a complex equation that didn't easily simplify to 36. Numerical experimentation with specific values like \\((4, 5, 6)\\) also didn't satisfy the equation. This indicates that perhaps the solution doesn't involve all variables being equal or that specific multiple relationships are needed.\n\n### **Identifying the Correct Approach: Using Symmetry and Specific Multiples**\n\n**Second Thoughts:**\n\nGiven the failure of my initial strategies, it's time to reconsider and look for patterns or relationships that might simplify the problem. The equation's symmetry suggests that the solution might involve specific multiples of the variables.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThinking back, I've seen similar problems where the solution involves setting the variables as multiples of each other. For instance, a common pattern is to have \\(x = k + a\\), \\(y = k + b\\), and \\(z = k + c\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants.

This implies that perhaps the relationships among \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are more nuanced than simply adding constants.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Using Symmetrical Properties**\n\nGiven the symmetry in the equation, it might be beneficial to consider that \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are symmetrical around certain central points. Perhaps exploring combinations where two of the variables are equal or have specific differences could uncover the correct relationship.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Assuming Specific Differences**\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the differences between the variables are constant. For instance, \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) could be three consecutive even or odd numbers, scaled appropriately. However, to satisfy the condition \\(x, y, z > 3\\), we need to find a suitable scaling factor.\n\n**Alternative Substitution:**\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n\\[\nx = k + 2, \\quad y = k + 4, \\quad z = k + 6\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k > 1\\) (to ensure \\(x, y, z > 3\\)).\n\n**Substituting into the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(k + 2 + 2)^2}{(k + 4) + (k + 6) - 2} + \\frac{(k + 4 + 4)^2}{(k + 6) + k - 4} + \\frac{(k + 6 + 6)^2}{k + (k + 4) - 6} = 36\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n1. **First Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(k + 4)^2}{2k + 8 - 2} = \\frac{(k + 4)^2}{2k + 6} = \\frac{k^2 + 8k + 16}{2k + 6}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(k + 8)^2}{2k + 4 - 4} = \\frac{(k + 8)^2}{2k} = \\frac{k^2 + 16k + 64}{2k}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(k + 12)^2}{2k - 4 - 6} = \\frac{(k + 12)^2}{2k - 10} = \\frac{k^2 + 24k + 144}{2k - 10}\n   \\]\n\n**Combining the Terms:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k^2 + 8k + 16}{2k + 6} + \\frac{k^2 + 16k + 64}{2k} + \\frac{k^2 + 24k + 144}{2k - 10} = 36\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Each Fraction:**\n\n1. **First Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{k^2 + 8k + 16}{2k + 6} = \\frac{k^2 + 8k + 16}{2(k + 3)} = \\frac{k + 4}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{k^2 + 16k + 64}{2k} = \\frac{2k^2 + 32k + 128}{4k} = \\frac{k + 16}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{k^2 + 24k + 144}{2k - 10} = \\frac{(k + 12)^2}{2(k - 5)} = \\frac{k + 12}{2}\n   \\]\n\n**Adding Up the Simplified Terms:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k + 4}{2} + \\frac{k + 16}{2} + \\frac{k + 12}{2} = \\frac{3k + 32}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Setting the Equation to 36:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3k + 32}{2} = 36\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(k\\):**\n\n\\[\n3k + 32 = 72 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3k = 40 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k = \\frac{40}{3} \\approx 13.33\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\):**\n\n\\[\nx = k + 2 = \\frac{40}{3} + 2 = \\frac{46}{3} \\approx 15.33\n\\]\n\\[\ny = k + 4 = \\frac{40}{3} + 4 = \\frac{52}{3} \\approx 17.33\n\\]\n\\[\nz = k + 6 = \\frac{40}{3} + 6 = \\frac{58}{3} \\approx 19.33\n\\]\n\n**Ordered Triple:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{46}{3}, \\frac{52}{3}, \\frac{58}{3}\\right) \\approx (15.33, 17.33, 19.33)\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s verify if this ordered triple satisfies the original equation.\n\n1. **First Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\left(\\frac{46}{3} + 2\\right)^2}{15.33 + 17.33 - 2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{52}{3}\\right)^2}{30.66} = \\frac{\\frac{2704}{9}}{30.66} \\approx 9.07\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\left(\\frac{52}{3} + 4\\right)^2}{19.33 + 15.33 - 4} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{58}{3}\\right)^2}{30.66} = \\frac{\\frac{3364}{9}}{30.66} \\approx 11.43\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\left(\\frac{58}{3} + 6\\right)^2}{11.33 + 19.33 - 6} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{64}{3}\\right)^2}{24.66} = \\frac{\\frac{4096}{9}}{24.66} \\approx 15.04\n   \\]\n\nAdding these up:\n\n\\[\n9.07 + 11.43 + 15.04 \\approx 35.54\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sum is approximately 35.54, which is very close to 36 but slightly off.

Let's take a step back and re-evaluate the problem, just like I would if I were trying to solve it manually. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect frequently to check if I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed. It's important to think out loud, explore various methods, and pivot when something doesn't work. Let's dive back into it.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting the Problem**\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + 2)^2}{y + z - 2} + \\frac{(y + 4)^2}{z + x - 4} + \\frac{(z + 6)^2}{x + y - 6} = 36\n\\]\n\nwith the constraints that \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are all real numbers greater than 3.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first encountered this problem, I recognized the potential for employing the **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality**, a powerful tool in handling such symmetric equations. However, my initial attempt led me down a complex path that didn't yield the correct solution. This suggests I might have overcomplicated things or made an incorrect assumption.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:** This seems like a promising approach given the symmetric nature of the equation. I recall using it in similar problems to establish relationships between the variables.\n\n2. **Substitution:** Attempting to simplify the equation by substituting each variable with a related expression.\n\n3. **Setting Variables Equal:** Assuming \\(x = y = z\\) to see if that leads to a valid solution.\n\n4. **Numerical Experimentation:** Testing specific values greater than 3 to find a potential solution.\n\n5. **Using Symmetry:** Leveraging the symmetric properties of the equation to simplify.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGiven the symmetry in the equation, I believe that the **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality** is indeed the most appropriate strategy here. Let's explore this approach step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Inequality**\n\nRecall that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\sum a_i b_i \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum a_i^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum b_i^2 \\right)\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we can rearrange the terms to fit this format.\n\n**Step 2: Rearranging the Equation**\n\nLet's consider the left side of the given equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + 2)^2}{y + z - 2} + \\frac{(y + 4)^2}{z + x - 4} + \\frac{(z + 6)^2}{x + y - 6}\n\\]\n\nWe can apply Cauchy-Schwarz by pairing numerators and denominators:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{(x + 2)^2}{y + z - 2} + \\frac{(y + 4)^2}{z + x - 4} + \\frac{(z + 6)^2}{x + y - 6} \\right) \\times \\left( (y + z - 2) + (z + x - 4) + (x + y - 6) \\right) \\geq [(x + 2) + (y + 4) + (z + 6)]^2\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplifying the Products**\n\nThe first product simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + 2)^2}{y + z - 2} + \\frac{(y + 4)^2}{z + x - 4} + \\frac{(z + 6)^2}{x + y - 6}\n\\]\n\nThe second product simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(y + z - 2) + (z + x - 4) + (x + y - 6) = 2(x + y + z) - 12\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Writing the Inequality**\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{(x + 2)^2}{y + z - 2} + \\frac{(y + 4)^2}{z + x - 4} + \\frac{(z + 6)^2}{x + y - 6} \\right) \\times [2(x + y + z) - 12] \\geq [x + y + z + 12]^2\n\\]\n\nGiven that the left side equals 36, we can substitute:\n\n\\[\n36 \\times [2s - 12] \\geq (s + 12)^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(s = x + y + z\\).\n\n**Step 5: Solving the Inequality**\n\nExpanding the inequality:\n\n\\[\n36(2s - 12) \\geq s^2 + 24s + 144\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n72s - 432 \\geq s^2 + 24s + 144\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n\\[\ns^2 - 48s + 576 \\leq 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Factoring the Quadratic**\n\nLet's factor the quadratic expression:\n\n\\[\ns^2 - 48s + 576 = (s - 24)^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the inequality becomes:\n\n\\[\n(s - 24)^2 \\leq 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 7: Interpreting the Inequality**\n\nThe only time the square of a real number is less than or equal to zero is when that number is zero. Therefore:\n\n\\[\ns = 24 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x + y + z = 24\n\\]\n\n**Step 8: Determining the Ratios**\n\nFrom the Cauchy-Schwarz application, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x + 2}{y + z - 2} = \\frac{y + 4}{z + x - 4} = \\frac{z + 6}{x + y - 6} = k\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(k\\) is a constant. This gives us three equations:\n\n1. \\(x + 2 = k(y + z - 2)\\)\n2. \\(y + 4 = k(z + x - 4)\\)\n3. \\(z + 6 = k(x + y - 6)\\)\n\n**Step 9: Solving the System of Equations**\n\nLet's solve for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) using the above equations.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n\\[\nx + 2 = k(y + z - 2) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x + 2 = k(24 - x - 2) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x + 2 = k(22 - x)\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\nx + 2 = 22k - kx \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x + kx = 22k - 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x(1 + k) = 22k - 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{22k - 2}{1 + k}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2):\n\n\\[\ny + 4 = k(z + x - 4) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y + 4 = k(24 - y - 4) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y + 4 = k(20 - y)\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\ny + 4 = 20k - ky \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y + ky = 20k - 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y(1 + k) = 20k - 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = \\frac{20k - 4}{1 + k}\n\\]\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\n\\[\nz + 6 = k(x + y - 6) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad z + 6 = k(24 - z - 6) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad z + 6 = k(18 - z)\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\nz + 6 = 18k - kz \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad z + kz = 18k - 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad z(1 + k) = 18k - 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad z = \\frac{18k - 6}{1 + k}\n\\]\n\n**Step 10: Finding \\(k\\)**\n\nNow, let's add these equations:\n\n\\[\nx + y + z = \\frac{22k - 2}{1 + k} + \\frac{20k - 4}{1 + k} + \\frac{18k - 6}{1 + k} = \\frac{(22k + 20k + 18k) - 2 - 4 - 6}{1 + k} = \\frac{60k - 12}{1 + k}\n\\]\n\nBut we know that \\(x + y + z = 24\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{60k - 12}{1 + k} = 24\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n60k - 12 = 24(1 + k) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 60k - 12 = 24 + 24k \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 36k = 36 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k = 1\n\\]\n\n**Step 11: Substituting \\(k = 1\\) Back into the Equations**\n\nNow, substitute \\(k = 1\\) into the expressions for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{22(1) - 2}{1 + 1} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{20(1) - 4}{1 + 1} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n\\]\n\\[\nz = \\frac{18(1) - 6}{1 + 1} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Ordered Triple:**\n\n\\[\n(x, y, z) = (10, 8, 6)\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet's verify if \\((10, 8, 6)\\) satisfies the original equation.\n\n1. **First Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(10 + 2)^2}{8 + 6 - 2} = \\frac{12^2}{12} = \\frac{144}{12} = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(8 + 4)^2}{6 + 10 - 4} = \\frac{12^2}{12} = \\frac{144}{12} = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(6 + 6)^2}{10 + 8 - 6} = \\frac{12^2}{12} = \\frac{144}{12} = 12\n   \\]\n\nAdding these up:\n\n\\[\n12 + 12 + 12 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\n\nThe left side equals 36, which matches the right side of the equation.
