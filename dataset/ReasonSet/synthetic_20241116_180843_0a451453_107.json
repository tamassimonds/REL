Here\u2019s how I would approach it step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. Here\u2019s the question again to get it fresh in my mind:\n\n**In 2003, the average monthly rainfall in Mathborough was \\(41.5 \\, \\text{mm}\\). In 2004, the average monthly rainfall in Mathborough was \\(2 \\, \\text{mm}\\) more than in 2003. What was the total amount of rain that fell in Mathborough in 2004?**\n\nHmm, right off the bat, I notice that the problem involves average monthly rainfall over a year. It reminds me of problems where you deal with averages and totals\u2014maybe something similar to calculating total expenses or average scores.\n\nThinking about it, to find the total rainfall for 2004, I should consider both the monthly average and the number of months in a year. That feels like the right direction. But let me brainstorm a bit more to ensure I\u2019m on the right track.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Multiply the Monthly Average by the Number of Months:**\n   - This seems straightforward. Since 2004 is a full year (12 months), multiplying the average monthly rainfall by 12 should give the total.\n\n2. **Adjust the 2003 Total by the Given Increase:**\n   - Another approach could be to find the total rainfall for 2003 and then add the increase for 2004. But wait, since we're given the average monthly increase, maybe this isn't necessary.\n\n3. **Check if February 2004 is a Leap Year:**\n   - A leap year has 29 days in February, which could affect the average. But hold on, the question specifically mentions average monthly rainfall, implying we're dealing with monthly averages regardless of the number of days.\n\nI think the first strategy\u2014multiplying the monthly average by 12\u2014makes the most sense. Let's proceed with that.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Average Monthly Rainfall for 2004**\n\nFirst, I need to determine the average monthly rainfall for 2004. The problem states that 2004's average is \\(2 \\, \\text{mm}\\) more than 2003's.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average monthly rainfall in 2004} = \\text{Average monthly rainfall in 2003} + 2 \\, \\text{mm} = 41.5 \\, \\text{mm} + 2 \\, \\text{mm} = 43.5 \\, \\text{mm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, does adding \\(2 \\, \\text{mm}\\) make sense? Yes, the problem specifies it's an increase, so adding \\(2 \\, \\text{mm}\\) to \\(41.5 \\, \\text{mm}\\) gives \\(43.5 \\, \\text{mm}\\). That feels correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Rainfall for 2004**\n\nNow that I have the average monthly rainfall for 2004, let's calculate the total for the year by multiplying by 12.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total rainfall in 2004} = \\text{Average monthly rainfall in 2004} \\times \\text{Number of months} = 43.5 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 12 = 522 \\, \\text{mm}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nHmm, does \\(522 \\, \\text{mm}\\) seem reasonable? Let me think\u2014last year was \\(41.5 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 12 = 498 \\, \\text{mm}\\). Adding \\(2 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 12 = 24 \\, \\text{mm}\\) to that gives \\(498 \\, \\text{mm} + 24 \\, \\text{mm} = 522 \\, \\text{mm}\\). So yeah, that checks out.\n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Approach**\n\nLet me step back and see if there's a flaw in the approach. Is there any other factor I might be missing?\n\n- **Leap Year Consideration:** The question specifies average monthly rainfall, so whether 2004 is a leap year or not shouldn't affect the monthly average.\n- **Daily Rainfall Variation:** If the problem provided daily rainfall data, that might add complexity, but here we're only dealing with monthly averages.\n\nI think the approach is solid. Multiplying the adjusted monthly average by 12 is straightforward and aligns with how average monthly rainfall should be calculated for a full year.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Total Calculation for 2003**\n\nJust to explore another method and ensure accuracy, let's calculate the total rainfall for 2003 and then add the increase for 2004.\n\n**Total Rainfall in 2003:**\n\n\\[\n41.5 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 12 = 498 \\, \\text{mm}\n\\]\n\n**Increase for 2004:**\n\n\\[\n2 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 12 = 24 \\, \\text{mm}\n\\]\n\n**Total Rainfall in 2004:**\n\n\\[\n498 \\, \\text{mm} + 24 \\, \\text{mm} = 522 \\, \\text{mm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth methods\u2014calculating the average rainfall for 2004 directly or adjusting the total rainfall for 2003\u2014yield the same result. This confirms the correctness of the solution.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet's do a quick sanity check:\n\n- **Consistency with Given Data:** The increase is \\(2 \\, \\text{mm}\\) per month, and there are 12 months, so the total increase aligns with the calculations.\n- **Comparison with Previous Year:** The total for 2004 is \\(522 \\, \\text{mm}\\), which is \\(24 \\, \\text{mm}\\) more than 2003's \\(498 \\, \\text{mm}\\). This matches the expected increase.\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the calculations, the total amount of rain that fell in Mathborough in 2004 is **522 mm**.",
