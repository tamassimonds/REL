  "problem": "Factor $36-9x^2$.",
  "solution": "---\n\n## **Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, we need to factor \\(36 - 9x^2\\). My first thought is that it resembles a quadratic expression. Factoring usually involves breaking it down into simpler multipliers. I've seen similar problems before, so maybe strategies like recognizing perfect squares or applying the difference of squares formula could work. Let's brainstorm to explore the best approach.\n\n---\n\n## **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Difference of Squares:**  \n   The expression looks like \\(a^2 - b^2\\), which factors into \\((a - b)(a + b)\\). This pattern might be applicable here.\n\n2. **Factoring Out a Common Factor:**  \n   I notice both 36 and 9 are multiples of 9. Perhaps factoring out 9 first could simplify the expression, making it easier to handle.\n\n3. **Quadratic Formula or Completing the Square:**  \n   These methods are generally used for solving equations, not just factoring expressions. Seems like overkill for this problem, so I'll keep them as a last resort.\n\n4. **Using Algebra Tiles or Visual Methods:**  \n   Visual methods can aid in understanding factoring, but for a straightforward expression like this, it might be unnecessary.\n\n**Initial Preference:**  \nStarting with factoring out a common factor seems sensible. It might simplify the expression, and then I can see if the difference of squares applies.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Factoring Out a Common Factor**\n\n### **Thought Process**\n\nLet's try factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) first. Since both 36 and 9 are divisible by 9, I'll factor 9 out of the expression.\n\n\\[\n36 - 9x^2 = 9(4 - x^2)\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nDoes this make sense?  \nYes, because if I distribute the 9 back, I get \\(9 \\times 4 = 36\\) and \\(9 \\times (-x^2) = -9x^2\\). So, factoring out 9 is correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Applying the Difference of Squares**\n\n### **Thought Process**\n\nNow, looking at the expression inside the parentheses: \\(4 - x^2\\). This reminds me of the difference of squares since 4 is \\(2^2\\) and \\(x^2\\) is obviously \\(x^2\\). The difference of squares formula is:\n\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = x\\). Let me apply this formula.\n\n\\[\n4 - x^2 = (2 - x)(2 + x)\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nIs this correct?  \nLet me quickly check by expanding \\((2 - x)(2 + x)\\):\n\n\\[\n(2 - x)(2 + x) = 2^2 - x^2 = 4 - x^2\n\\]\n\nYes, that works perfectly. So, the factoring is correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Combining Both Steps**\n\n### **Thought Process**\n\nNow, I'll combine the factored out 9 with the result from the difference of squares.\n\n\\[\n36 - 9x^2 = 9(4 - x^2) = 9(2 - x)(2 + x)\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nDoes the final expression make sense?  \nLet me expand it back to verify:\n\n\\[\n9(2 - x)(2 + x) = 9 \\times (4 - x^2) = 36 - 9x^2\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out. The original expression is perfectly reconstructed.\n\n---\n\n## **Alternative Approach: Direct Difference of Squares**\n\n### **Thought Process**\n\nWait a minute, I initially factored out 9 to simplify, but I wonder if I could have applied the difference of squares directly to the original expression.\n\n- **Original Expression:**  \n  \\(36 - 9x^2\\)\n\n- Notice that both 36 and 9 are perfect squares:  \n  \\(36 = (6)^2\\) and \\(9x^2 = (3x)^2\\)\n\n- So, I can write the expression as:  \n  \\((6)^2 - (3x)^2\\)\n\n- Applying the difference of squares formula:  \n  \\((a - b)(a + b) = (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x)\\)\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nDoes this factorization match the previous one?  \nNot exactly, but let's see if they are equivalent.\n\n\\[\n9(2 - x)(2 + x) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both:\n\n1. \\(9(2 - x)(2 + x)\\):  \n   \\[\n   9 \\times (4 - x^2) = 36 - 9x^2\n   \\]\n\n2. \\((6 - 3x)(6 + 3x)\\):  \n   \\[\n   36 - 9x^2\n   \\]\n\nBoth expand back to the original expression, so both factorizations are correct. However, factoring out the 9 first gives a simpler form.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nI think factoring out the common factor first makes the expression cleaner and easier to handle. But it's good to know that applying the difference of squares directly also works.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me quickly run through the steps again to ensure everything is accurate.\n\n1. **Factored Out 9:**  \n   \\[\n   36 - 9x^2 = 9(4 - x^2)\n   \\]\n   \u2714\ufe0f Verified by distributing back.\n\n2. **Applied Difference of Squares:**  \n   \\[\n   4 - x^2 = (2 - x)(2 + x)\n   \\]\n   \u2714\ufe0f Verified by expanding.\n\n3. **Combined Both Steps:**  \n   \\[\n   36 - 9x^2 = 9(2 - x)(2 + x)\n   \\]\n   \u2714\ufe0f Final expansion matches the original expression.\n\nEverything checks out, so I'm confident the factorization is correct.\n\n---\n\n## **<ANSWER> Solution</ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n36 - 9x^2 = 9(2 - x)(2 + x)\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nReflecting on the process, starting with factoring out the greatest common factor made the problem more straightforward. It allowed me to easily apply the difference of squares formula. Exploring multiple strategies helped confirm the correctness of the solution, and checking each step ensured that no mistakes were made.\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step and verifying each part, I ensured the accuracy of the final answer. This methodical approach is essential in problem-solving to avoid errors and build confidence in the solution.\n\n---\n\n**JibrilKURU Algorithm Explanation:**  \nThinking like a human, brainstorming various strategies, reviewing each step to ensure correctness, and being open to adjusting approaches as needed, reflecting a natural problem-solving process.",
  "ground_truth": "We have $36-9x^2 = 6^2 - (3x)^2 = (6-3x)(6+3x)$.  We can factor a 3 out of each of $6-3x$ and $6+3x$ to give $3\\cdot(2-x)\\cdot 3\\cdot(2+x) = \\boxed{9(2-x)(2+x)}$. (We could also have factored out a 9 at the beginning: $36-9x^2 = 9(4-x^2)=9(2-x)(2+x)$.)"
