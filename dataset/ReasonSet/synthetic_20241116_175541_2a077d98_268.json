I\u2019ll walk through my thought process step by step, brainstorming different approaches, reflecting on their validity, and adjusting as needed. Let\u2019s emulate a human's natural problem-solving journey, complete with initial confusion, possible dead ends, and enlightening \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see that it's about finding the **area of a rectangle inscribed in a triangle**. The triangle has a base of length \\( b \\) and an altitude of length \\( h \\). The rectangle shares its base with the triangle and has a height of \\( x \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Similar Triangles:** This immediately reminds me of problems involving similar triangles. Maybe I can relate the sides of the rectangle to parts of the triangle using similarity.\n  \n- **Area Calculations:** I recall that the area of a rectangle is base times height. Perhaps I can express both dimensions in terms of \\( b \\), \\( h \\), and \\( x \\).\n\n- **Proportionality:** Maybe proportionality plays a role here, where the sides of the rectangle are proportional to the sides of the triangle.\n\nAt this point, I'm leaning towards exploring **similar triangles** and **proportionality**, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the right path. Let\u2019s explore these ideas further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Similar Triangles Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If I draw the rectangle inside the triangle, the top corners of the rectangle will touch the sides of the triangle. Perhaps I can use similar triangles to relate the dimensions.\n\n- Given that the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Identify Similar Triangles:**\n   - The entire triangle has a height \\( h \\) and base \\( b \\).\n   - The rectangle has height \\( x \\), so the remaining height above the rectangle is \\( h - x \\).\n\n2. **Applying Similarity:**\n   - The small triangle at the top has a height \\( h - x \\).\n   - Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding heights equals the ratio of bases.\n\n3. **Proportionality:**\n   - Let\u2019s denote the base of the small triangle as \\( b' \\).\n   - Using the ratio:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{h - x}{h} = \\frac{b'}{b}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     b' = \\frac{b(b - b')}{b} = b - b'\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2b' = b \\Rightarrow b' = \\frac{b}{2}\n     \\]\n   \nWait, this can't be right. **Reflection:**\n\n- **Mistake Identified:** I ended up with \\( b' = \\frac{b}{2} \\), which doesn't align with the geometry. The base of the small triangle should be proportional, but this ratio seems incorrect.\n\n- **Adjusting the Approach:** Maybe I misapplied the similarity. Let\u2019s revisit the proportions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Correcting the Similar Triangles Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Reexamine the similarity ratios. The rectangle\u2019s sides should be proportional to the triangle\u2019s sides, considering their respective heights.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Correct Proportionality:**\n   - Only the height of the small triangle is \\( h - x \\).\n   - The base of the rectangle should reduce proportionally.\n\n2. **Using Similarity:**\n   - Since the triangles are similar:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{h - x}{h} = \\frac{\\text{base of rectangle }}{b}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{h - x}{h} = \\frac{b_r}{b}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     b_r = \\frac{b(h - x)}{h}\n     \\]\n   \n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense?  \n- **Quick Check:** The base of the rectangle \\( b_r \\) depends on \\( h - x \\), which aligns with the idea that as \\( x \\) increases, \\( b_r \\) decreases.\n\n- **Feel Right:** This seems logical. The rectangle\u2019s base is smaller than the triangle\u2019s base, proportional to the height \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Area of the Rectangle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have both dimensions for the rectangle\u2014height \\( x \\) and base \\( b_r = \\frac{b(h - x)}{h} \\)\u2014I can calculate the area.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Area Formula for Rectangle:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = b_r \\times x\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substituting \\( b_r \\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{b(h - x)}{h} \\times x = \\frac{bx(h - x)}{h}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Match Any Options?** Let\u2019s look at the provided options:\n  \n  - **(A)** \\( \\frac{bx}{h}(h - x) \\)\n  - **(B)** \\( \\frac{hx}{b}(b - x) \\)\n  - **(C)** \\( \\frac{bx}{h}(h - 2x) \\)\n  - **(D)** \\( x(b - x) \\)\n  - **(E)** \\( x(h - x) \\)\n\n- **Matching with Option (A):**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{bx(h - x)}{h} = \\frac{bx}{h}(h - x)\n  \\]\n  \n  This exactly matches option (A).\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Cross-Verification:** Thinking back, the proportionality setting up similar triangles seems to have worked correctly after adjusting the initial mistake.\n\n- **Sample Values Test:** Let\u2019s say \\( b = 6 \\), \\( h = 4 \\), and \\( x = 2 \\):\n  \\[\n  b_r = \\frac{6(4 - 2)}{4} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n  \\]\n  \n  Plugging into option (A):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{6 \\times 2}{4} \\times (4 - 2) = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n  \\]\n  \n  **Matches!** This confirms that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and correcting initial missteps, I arrived at the area of the rectangle as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{bx}{h}(h - x)\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{bx}{h}(h - x)\\)\n\nThroughout the process, reflecting on each step helped ensure the approach was correct, and checking against the provided options confirmed the validity of the solution.",
