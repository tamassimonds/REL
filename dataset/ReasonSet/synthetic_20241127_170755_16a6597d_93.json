  "solution": "Alright, let's put everything together into a complete, coherent solution while maintaining the original human touch. I'll keep the final answer unchanged but streamline the process for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the question asks how many positive integers less than 500 can be written as the sum of two positive perfect cubes. At first glance, this reminds me of problems involving sums of squares or cubes, but I'm not entirely sure of the best approach yet. I need to brainstorm some strategies to get started.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **List All Perfect Cubes Less Than 500:**\n   - Maybe I can list all perfect cubes less than 500 and see which sums work.\n   \n2. **Explore Combinations of Cubes:**\n   - Try adding different pairs of cubes to see which sums are less than 500.\n   \n3. **Use Mathematical Formulas:**\n   - Perhaps there's a formula or theorem that can simplify this process.\n\n4. **Programming Approach:**\n   - Writing a simple program to compute all possible sums could be efficient.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nListing cubes and their sums manually might be tedious, but it could give me a better understanding of the problem. Let\u2019s start with that and see how it goes. If it gets too cumbersome, I can switch to a different method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: List All Perfect Cubes Less Than 500**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me list the perfect cubes of positive integers \\( n \\) where \\( n^3 < 500 \\). This will give me the building blocks for the sums.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- \\( 1^3 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 2^3 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 3^3 = 27 \\)\n- \\( 4^3 = 64 \\)\n- \\( 5^3 = 125 \\)\n- \\( 6^3 = 216 \\)\n- \\( 7^3 = 343 \\)\n- \\( 8^3 = 512 \\) (Oops, this is greater than 500)\n\nSo, the perfect cubes less than 500 are:  \n**1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me double-check these calculations to ensure accuracy. Yup, all cubes up to \\( 7^3 \\) are correct, and \\( 8^3 \\) exceeds 500, so I\u2019ll stop there.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Explore Combinations of Cubes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find all unique sums of two different cubes from this list that are less than 500. It seems straightforward, but I should be careful to consider only **positive integers** and **unique sums**.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Use each cube as the first term and add it to each cube equal to or greater than itself.\n- Ensure sums are less than 500.\n- Keep track of unique sums to avoid duplicates.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis might involve a lot of calculations, so I need to organize my work to avoid missing any combinations or repeating sums.\n\n**Check Combinations:**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the smallest cube and work our way up.\n\n1. **Cube = 1**\n   - \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\)\n   - \\( 1 + 8 = 9 \\)\n   - \\( 1 + 27 = 28 \\)\n   - \\( 1 + 64 = 65 \\)\n   - \\( 1 + 125 = 126 \\)\n   - \\( 1 + 216 = 217 \\)\n   - \\( 1 + 343 = 344 \\)\n\n2. **Cube = 8**\n   - \\( 8 + 8 = 16 \\)\n   - \\( 8 + 27 = 35 \\)\n   - \\( 8 + 64 = 72 \\)\n   - \\( 8 + 125 = 133 \\)\n   - \\( 8 + 216 = 224 \\)\n   - \\( 8 + 343 = 351 \\)\n\n3. **Cube = 27**\n   - \\( 27 + 27 = 54 \\)\n   - \\( 27 + 64 = 91 \\)\n   - \\( 27 + 125 = 152 \\)\n   - \\( 27 + 216 = 243 \\)\n   - \\( 27 + 343 = 370 \\)\n\n4. **Cube = 64**\n   - \\( 64 + 64 = 128 \\)\n   - \\( 64 + 125 = 189 \\)\n   - \\( 64 + 216 = 280 \\)\n   - \\( 64 + 343 = 407 \\)\n\n5. **Cube = 125**\n   - \\( 125 + 125 = 250 \\)\n   - \\( 125 + 216 = 341 \\)\n   - \\( 125 + 343 = 468 \\)\n\n6. **Cube = 216**\n   - \\( 216 + 216 = 432 \\)\n   - \\( 216 + 343 = 559 \\) (Exceeds 500, so ignore)\n\n7. **Cube = 343**\n   - \\( 343 + 343 = 686 \\) (Exceeds 500, so ignore)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI\u2019ve listed all combinations where the sum is less than 500. However, I need to ensure that these sums are unique and that I haven't missed any valid combinations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Collect Unique Sums**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI should compile the sums into a list and remove any duplicates to ensure each sum is counted only once.\n\n**Unique Sums List:**\n\nLet\u2019s jot down all the unique sums from the combinations above:\n\n- \\( 2, 9, 28, 65, 126, 217, 344, 16, 35, 72, 133, 224, 351, 54, 91, 152, 243, 370, 128, 189, 280, 407, 250, 341, 468, 432 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute, thinking like a human, I realize listing them like this might lead to errors or missing duplicates. It would be better to organize them in ascending order to spot any duplicates easily.\n\n**Ordered Unique Sums:**\n\nLet me sort these sums to check for duplicates:\n\n- \\( 2, 9, 16, 28, 35, 54, 65, 72, 91, 126, 128, 133, 152, 189, 217, 224, 243, 250, 280, 341, 344, 351, 370, 407, 432, 468 \\)\n\n**Checking for Duplicates:**\n\nLooking through the ordered list, I don't see any duplicates. So, it seems I've captured all unique sums correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore proceeding, let me verify if this approach is correct. Is there anything I might have overlooked? For instance, do I need to consider sums involving the same cube twice, or have I missed any combinations?\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nActually, I included sums like \\( 1 + 1 \\) and \\( 8 + 8 \\), which are valid since the problem allows the sum of two **positive perfect cubes**, including repeating the same cube. So, I think my approach is valid.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet me randomly pick a few sums and ensure they are correct:\n\n- \\( 1 + 8 = 9 \\) \u2013 Correct\n- \\( 27 + 64 = 91 \\) \u2013 Correct\n- \\( 125 + 216 = 341 \\) \u2013 Correct\n\nEverything seems to check out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Count the Unique Sums**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to count how many unique sums I have that are less than 500.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nCounting the ordered list:\n\n- There are **26** unique sums.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, 26 seems like a plausible number, but let me double-check to ensure I haven't missed any sums or included any duplicates. I\u2019ll recount the list to be certain.\n\n**Recount:**\n\nAfter recounting, I still arrive at **26** unique sums. So, it seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let me consider if there's a more efficient method or if I might have overlooked something. For example, would writing a simple program help verify the sums, or is there a mathematical formula that could simplify this?\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Programming Approach**\n\nWriting a small script to compute all possible sums could serve as a verification step. However, since I've manually listed and verified the sums already, this might be an unnecessary step. But it\u2019s always good to have a backup method.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the straightforward nature of the problem and the successful manual verification, I\u2019ll proceed with the manual count.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThere are **26** positive integers less than 500 that can be written as the sum of two positive perfect cubes.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy listing all perfect cubes less than 500, exploring all combinations of their sums, ensuring uniqueness, and verifying each step, I've determined that there are 26 such integers. Regular reflection and verification throughout the process helped ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThis step-by-step approach enabled me to tackle the problem effectively, ensuring no unique sums were missed while keeping the process organized and error-free.",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $7^3 < 500 < 8^3,$ so any positive integer that can be written as the sum of two positive perfect cubes must be written as the sum of two cubes $a^3 + b^3$ where $1 \\le a \\le 7$ and $1 \\le b \\le 7.$ We can make a chart of the sum of two such cubes: $$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}\n& 1^3 & 2^3 & 3^3 & 4^3 & 5^3 & 6^3 & 7^3 \\\\ \\hline\n1^3 & 2 & 9 & 28 & 65 & 126 & 217 & 344 \\\\\n2^3 & & 16 & 35 & 72 & 133 & 224 & 351 \\\\\n3^3 & & & 54 & 91 & 152 & 243 & 370 \\\\\n4^3 & & & & 128 & 189 & 280 & 407 \\\\\n5^3 & & & & & 250 & 341 & 468 \\\\\n6^3 & & & & & & 432 & {559} \\\\\n7^3 & & & & & & & {686}\n\\end{array}\n$$ As we can see from the chart, there are $\\boxed{26}$ such numbers less than $500.$"
