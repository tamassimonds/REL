  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll emulate a genuine thought process, complete with brainstorming, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the question is about two 2-digit positive integers. Their average is equal to a decimal number formed by placing one integer before the decimal point and the other after.\n\n1. **Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n   - **Set Up an Equation:** Maybe create an equation involving averages.\n   - **Think About Decimals:** Consider how the decimal number is formed.\n   - **Explore Combinations:** Try different pairs of two-digit numbers to see patterns.\n\nHonestly, I'm a bit unsure where to start, so let me explore a few strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 1: Setting Up an Average Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's try setting up an equation based on the definition of an average. The average of two numbers is their sum divided by two. Maybe I can relate this to the decimal number given.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n\n   - Let the two integers be \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n2. **Write the Average:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{A + B}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express the Decimal Number:**\n\n   - The decimal number is formed by writing \\( A \\) before the decimal point and \\( B \\) after, so:\n   \n   \\[\n   A.B = A + \\frac{B}{100}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{A + B}{2} = A + \\frac{B}{100}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis setup seems logical. Let me simplify the equation to see if it leads anywhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Simplifying the Equation**\n\n1. **Multiply Both Sides by 100 to Eliminate Fractions:**\n\n   \\[\n   100 \\times \\frac{A + B}{2} = 100 \\times \\left( A + \\frac{B}{100} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   50(A + B) = 100A + B\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand Both Sides:**\n\n   \\[\n   50A + 50B = 100A + B\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rearrange Terms:**\n\n   \\[\n   50B - B = 100A - 50A\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   49B = 50A\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( B \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{50A}{49}\n   \\]\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\n**Checking for Validity:**  \nSince \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are two-digit integers, this equation suggests that \\( B \\) is \\( \\frac{50}{49} \\) times \\( A \\). But \\( \\frac{50}{49} \\approx 1.02 \\), meaning \\( B \\) is slightly larger than \\( A \\).\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?**  \n  Yes, since both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are two-digit numbers, and this ratio keeps \\( B \\) within the two-digit range.\n\n**But Wait...**  \nThe solution seems too straightforward. Let me plug in some sample values to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Testing with Sample Values**\n\n**Sample 1:**\n\n- **Let \\( A = 49 \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  B = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{49} = 50\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculate the Average:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{49 + 50}{2} = \\frac{99}{2} = 49.5\n  \\]\n\n- **Form the Decimal Number:**\n  \n  \\[\n  49.50\n  \\]\n\n- **Comparison:**\n  \n  \\[\n  49.5 \\neq 49.50\n  \\]\n\n**Wait, That Can't Be Right!**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, the average doesn't match the decimal number formed. There's definitely something off here. Maybe my initial equation isn't capturing the relationship correctly.\n\n**Time to Reconsider:**  \nLooks like Strategy 1 didn't work as expected. I need to think of a different approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 2: Leveraging the Properties of Averages and Decimals**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet me think differently. The average of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is a number with at most one decimal place (since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are integers). Meanwhile, \\( A.B \\) is a decimal with exactly two decimal places. Perhaps I can leverage this difference.\n\n**Alternative Setup:**  \nConsider that the average \\( \\frac{A + B}{2} \\) must equal \\( A + \\frac{B}{100} \\). This implies that the decimal part of the average comes solely from \\( \\frac{B}{100} \\).\n\n1. **Rewrite the Equation:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{A + B}{2} - A = \\frac{B}{100}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{B - A}{2} = \\frac{B}{100}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cross-Multiply to Eliminate Fractions:**\n\n   \\[\n   100(B - A) = 2B\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expand and Rearrange:**\n\n   \\[\n   100B - 100A = 2B\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   100B - 2B = 100A\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   98B = 100A\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Solve for \\( A \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{98B}{100} = \\frac{49B}{50}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{49}{50}B\n   \\]\n\n**Interpretation:**  \nThis means \\( A \\) is \\( \\frac{49}{50} \\) times \\( B \\), or \\( A \\) is 98% of \\( B \\).\n\n**Check for Validity:**  \nSince \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are two-digit integers, this ratio should hold within that range.\n\n---\n\n### **Testing the New Equation with Samples**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's find two-digit integers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) that satisfy \\( A = \\frac{49}{50}B \\).\n\n**Finding Suitable Integers:**  \nMultiply both sides by 50 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n50A = 49B\n\\]\n\nThis implies that \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) must be multiples of 49 and 50, respectively, within the two-digit range.\n\n**Sample Calculation:**\n\n1. **Set \\( B = 50 \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{49}{50} \\times 50 = 49\n   \\]\n   \n   - **Check:**\n     - \\( A = 49 \\), \\( B = 50 \\)\n     - Average \\( = \\frac{49 + 50}{2} = 49.5 \\)\n     - Decimal number \\( = 49.50 \\)\n     - **Match:** \\( 49.5 = 49.50 \\)\n\n**WAIT A MOMENT!**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nActually, \\( 49.5 \\) and \\( 49.50 \\) are numerically equal. So this sample does satisfy the condition.\n\n**But Let's Double-Check:**  \nIs there a smaller pair of integers that also satisfies this?\n\n2. **Set \\( B = 100 \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{49}{50} \\times 100 = 98\n   \\]\n   \n   - **Check:**\n     - \\( A = 98 \\), \\( B = 100 \\)\n     - Average \\( = \\frac{98 + 100}{2} = 99 \\)\n     - Decimal number \\( = 98.100 \\)\n     - **Mismatch:** \\( 99 \\neq 98.100 \\)\n\n**REALIZATION:**  \nOh, wait! When \\( B = 100 \\), \\( A \\) becomes 98, which still satisfies the ratio, but the decimal representation exceeds two digits after the decimal point. Therefore, \\( B \\) must remain a two-digit number.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**  \nThe smallest valid pair is \\( A = 49 \\) and \\( B = 50 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe smaller of the two integers is **49**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap and Reflection**\n\n**1. Initial Attempt:**\n\n   - Started by setting up an average equation, but sample values didn't align, indicating a flaw in the approach.\n\n**2. Brainstorming Alternative Strategies:**\n\n   - Considered expressing the decimal differently but realized the initial setup was correct. The issue was with sample values leading to invalid two-digit numbers.\n\n**3. Leveraging Ratios:**\n\n   - Simplified the equation to find a proportional relationship between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), leading to \\( A = \\frac{49}{50}B \\).\n\n**4. Testing with Valid Samples:**\n\n   - Found that \\( A = 49 \\) and \\( B = 50 \\) satisfy the condition, with the average matching the decimal representation.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nBy verifying with sample values and ensuring that both integers remain within the two-digit range, the solution is confirmed to be correct.\n\n**Closing Thoughts:**  \nThis problem required careful consideration of how averages and decimal representations relate. Initial missteps were valuable in steering towards the correct approach, emphasizing the importance of testing and validating equations with real-world samples.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's how I would naturally think through solving this problem, adjusting my strategies along the way, and ensuring the solution holds up through verification.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the two numbers be $m=AB$ and $n=CD$ (where $A,B,C$ and $D$ are digits). The average of $m$ and $n$ is $\\frac{m+n}{2}$ and the number formed by writing $m$ before the decimal point and $n$ after the decimal point is: $$AB.CD = AB + 0.CD = AB+\\frac{CD}{100} = m+\\frac{n}{100}.$$ Setting these equal gives: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{m+n}{2} &= m+\\frac{n}{100}\\\\\n50m+50n &= 100m+n\\\\\n49n &= 50m\n\\end{align*} From this it follows that $n$ a multiple of 50. As $n$ is a 2-digit positive integer this means that $n=50$. So now $50m = 49n = 49\\cdot 50$, so $m=49$. Thus the integers are $49$ and $50$, so the smaller integer is $\\boxed{49}$."
