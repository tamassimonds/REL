    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each approach, and checking if I'm on the right track throughout. Let's see where this takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe equation given is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot f(x) + 4 \\cdot g(x) = h(x) \\]\n\nwhere \\( f(x) \\), \\( g(x) \\), and \\( h(x) \\) are polynomials. We know:\n\n- The degree of \\( f(x) \\) is **8**.\n- The degree of \\( h(x) \\) is **9**.\n  \n**Question:** What is the **minimum possible degree** of \\( g(x) \\)?\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Polynomial Degrees:** I remember that the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of \\( x \\) in it. When adding or multiplying polynomials, the degrees can impact the resulting polynomial\u2019s degree.\n  \n- **Combination of Polynomials:** Since \\( h(x) \\) is a combination of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\), perhaps the degrees of these polynomials affect the degree of \\( h(x) \\).\n  \n- **Properties of Degrees:** Maybe I can use properties like the degree of a sum or the degree of scaled polynomials to find the minimum degree of \\( g(x) \\).\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**  \n  1. **Degree Addition Rule:** Check if the degrees add up in a specific way.  \n  2. **Contradiction Approach:** Assume different degrees for \\( g(x) \\) and see if they hold.  \n  3. **Scaling Effects:** Consider how multiplying a polynomial by a constant affects its degree.  \n  4. **Degree of a Sum:** Determine how the degrees of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) combine to affect \\( h(x) \\).\n\nInitial Reaction: This seems like a problem involving the interplay between polynomial degrees. I'm leaning towards exploring how the degrees affect each other, possibly using the properties of polynomial addition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Degree Addition Rule**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s start by considering how the degrees of polynomials combine when added together. I recall that, in general:\n\n- The degree of a sum \\( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) \\) is the maximum degree of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\), unless the leading terms cancel each other out.\n\nBut wait, our equation is slightly different:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot f(x) + 4 \\cdot g(x) = h(x) \\]\n\nHere, \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are multiplied by constants (3 and 4). Does that change anything?\n\n**Exploring:**\n\nMultiplying a polynomial by a non-zero constant doesn\u2019t change its degree. So:\n\n- \\( \\text{deg}(3 \\cdot f(x)) = \\text{deg}(f(x)) = 8 \\)\n- \\( \\text{deg}(4 \\cdot g(x)) = \\text{deg}(g(x)) \\)\n\nThus, the degree of \\( h(x) \\) should be the maximum of the degrees of \\( 3 \\cdot f(x) \\) and \\( 4 \\cdot g(x) \\):\n\n\\[ \\text{deg}(h(x)) = \\max(8, \\text{deg}(g(x))) \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense because the degree of a polynomial sum is determined by the highest degree among the addends, provided there\u2019s no cancellation.\n\n**Checking:** Given \\( \\text{deg}(h(x)) = 9 \\), for the maximum to be 9, \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) \\) must at least be 9.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Assigning \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) \\) = 9**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s assume the degree of \\( g(x) \\) is 9. If \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) = 9 \\), then:\n\n\\[ \\text{deg}(h(x)) = \\max(8, 9) = 9 \\]\n\nThis satisfies the given condition that \\( \\text{deg}(h(x)) = 9 \\).\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) = 9 \\) \u2192 \\( \\text{deg}(h(x)) = 9 \\)\n- This aligns with the provided information.\n\n**Insight:**\n\nAt first glance, it seems like assigning \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) = 9 \\) works. But is this the **minimum** possible degree for \\( g(x) \\)? Maybe I need to explore further to ensure there isn't a lower degree that still satisfies the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering the Contradiction Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens if we assume \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) < 9 \\). \n\n- For \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) < 9 \\), the maximum degree between \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) would be 8, because \\( \\text{deg}(f(x)) = 8 \\).\n\nBut this would lead to:\n\n\\[ \\text{deg}(h(x)) = \\max(8, \\text{deg}(g(x))) = 8 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that can't be right because we know \\( \\text{deg}(h(x)) = 9 \\). So, if \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) < 9 \\), it contradicts the given condition.\n\n**Insight:**\n\nThis suggests that \\( g(x) \\) must have a degree of at least 9 for \\( h(x) \\) to reach its degree of 9.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Reassessing the Minimum Degree for \\( g(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven that assigning \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) = 9 \\) satisfies all conditions and assuming any lower degree leads to a contradiction, it seems that the **minimum** possible degree for \\( g(x) \\) is indeed 9.\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- **If \\( g(x) \\) has degree 9:**  \n  - \\( \\text{deg}(h(x)) = \\max(8, 9) = 9 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  \n- **If \\( g(x) \\) has degree < 9:**  \n  - \\( \\text{deg}(h(x)) = \\max(8, \\text{deg}(g(x))) = 8 \\) \u2716\ufe0f Contradicts given \\( \\text{deg}(h(x)) = 9 \\)\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe degree of \\( g(x) \\) must be **9** to ensure that \\( h(x) \\) reaches its degree of 9.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe minimum possible degree of \\( g(x) \\) is **9**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Strategy Reflection:** Starting with exploring the degree addition rule helped me identify the relationship between the degrees of \\( f(x) \\), \\( g(x) \\), and \\( h(x) \\). \n- **Contradiction Method:** This method confirmed that any degree lower than 9 for \\( g(x) \\) would contradict the given degree of \\( h(x) \\).\n- **Checking Worked:** Regularly checking each step ensured that the logic held throughout, preventing mistakes.\n\nOverall, carefully considering how polynomial degrees interact and checking assumptions led to the correct minimum degree for \\( g(x) \\).",
