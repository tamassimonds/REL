    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work as I go, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I notice it's about making a piecewise function **continuous**. Continuity at a point usually means that the limits from the left and right at that point are equal to the function's value. \n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**  \n  - This reminds me of problems where you have to match pieces of a function at a specific point, in this case, \\( x = 3 \\).\n  - I think I need to ensure that both pieces of the function agree at \\( x = 3 \\).\n  - Maybe setting the two expressions equal at \\( x = 3 \\) would work?\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**  \n  1. **Set the two expressions equal at \\( x = 3 \\):** This seems straightforward\u2014if the function is continuous, the output from both pieces should match at that point.\n  2. **Check left-hand and right-hand limits separately:** Ensure both limits are equal to the function value at \\( x = 3 \\).\n  3. **Graphical Approach:** Visualize the function to see if there's a jump or gap at \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n- **Which to Try First?**  \n  I'm leaning towards **Strategy 1**, setting the two expressions equal at \\( x = 3 \\). It seems the simplest and most direct way to ensure continuity. If this doesn't work, I'll explore the other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Set the Two Expressions Equal at \\( x = 3 \\)**\n\nLet's apply Strategy 1. I'll set the two pieces of the function equal to each other at \\( x = 3 \\) to find the required value of \\( a \\).\n\n- **Given Function:**\n  \\[\n  f(x) = \n  \\begin{cases} \n  x + 2 & \\text{if } x > 3 \\\\ \n  2x + a & \\text{if } x \\leq 3 \n  \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n\n- **Set the Two Expressions Equal at \\( x = 3 \\):**\n  \\[\n  3 + 2 = 2(3) + a\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculate:**\n  \\[\n  5 = 6 + a\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  5 - 6 = a\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  a = -1\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This gives me \\( a = -1 \\). It seems logical because if the function is continuous, both pieces should provide the same output at \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - Left side: \\( 3 + 2 = 5 \\)\n  - Right side with \\( a = -1 \\): \\( 2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 \\)\n  - Both sides equal: \\( 5 = 5 \\). Perfect!\n\n- **Does This Approach Make Sense?**  \n  Yes, setting the two expressions equal ensures that there\u2019s no jump or gap at \\( x = 3 \\), which is a core requirement for continuity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verify by Checking Left-Hand and Right-Hand Limits**\n\nEven though Strategy 1 worked, let's double-check by examining the left-hand and right-hand limits at \\( x = 3 \\). This will confirm that my solution is robust.\n\n- **Right-Hand Limit (\\( x \\to 3^+ \\)):**\n  \\[\n  f(x) = x + 2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\lim_{x \\to 3^+} f(x) = 3 + 2 = 5\n  \\]\n\n- **Left-Hand Limit (\\( x \\to 3^- \\)):**\n  \\[\n  f(x) = 2x + a\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\lim_{x \\to 3^-} f(x) = 2(3) + (-1) = 6 - 1 = 5\n  \\]\n\n- **Limit Equality:**\n  \\[\n  \\lim_{x \\to 3^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 3^-} f(x) = 5\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Both limits are equal and match the function value at \\( x = 3 \\). This further validates that \\( a = -1 \\) makes the function continuous.\n\n- **Is This Consistent With Strategy 1?**  \n  Absolutely. Strategy 1 provided the correct value of \\( a \\), and verifying with limits confirms its correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\nAlthough Strategy 1 worked well, it's good to explore other methods to ensure comprehensive understanding.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy:**  \n  **Graphical Approach:** Graphing both pieces to visually check continuity at \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - If I were to plot \\( f(x) = x + 2 \\) and \\( f(x) = 2x + a \\) on a graph, adjusting \\( a \\) to \\( -1 \\) should align both pieces at \\( x = 3 \\).\n  - This visual confirmation can serve as an additional check.\n\n- **Potential Drawbacks:**\n  - Graphing might not be precise without actual plotting tools.\n  - It\u2019s more time-consuming than algebraic methods.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  While useful, the graphical approach is less practical here since we already have a solid algebraic solution. It\u2019s always good to have multiple strategies, but ensuring algebraic correctness is often sufficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Did Strategy 1 Work?**  \n  Yes, setting the two expressions equal at \\( x = 3 \\) directly provided the correct value of \\( a = -1 \\).\n\n- **Was the Verification Step Helpful?**  \n  Absolutely. Checking left-hand and right-hand limits confirmed the continuity condition was met, reinforcing the correctness of \\( a = -1 \\).\n\n- **Is There Anything More to Consider?**  \n  No, the problem is straightforward in terms of ensuring continuity at \\( x = 3 \\). Alternative strategies, like graphical methods, can be helpful for visual learners but aren't necessary here.\n\n- **Final Answer:**  \n  To make the piecewise function continuous, \\( a \\) must be **\\(-1\\)**.\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem step by step, exploring different strategies, and constantly reflecting and verifying, I've arrived at the solution confidently. This methodical process ensures accuracy and deepens understanding.",
