    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking it through just as a human would. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work often, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see this problem:\n\n**User's Request:**\n\"The length of a rectangle is increased by 25%, but the width is decreased to keep the area unchanged. By what percent was the rectangle's width decreased?\"\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving percentages and dimensions of geometric shapes. I think I've dealt with similar percentage change problems before, especially those related to maintaining area.\n\n- **Possible Approaches:**\n  1. **Use Algebraic Equations:** Set up equations based on the given percentage changes.\n  2. **Percentage Increase and Decrease Calculations:** Calculate the new dimensions using percentage changes.\n  3. **Area Equivalence Approach:** Since the area remains unchanged, relate the changes in length and width to the area formula.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not sure which method will be the most straightforward. Maybe starting with algebra would set a clear foundation.\n\n### **Step 1: Define Variables and Set Up the Problem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet me define the dimensions of the rectangle before any changes. This will help me set up equations based on the percentage changes.\n\n- **Let:**\n  - \\( L \\) = Original length of the rectangle\n  - \\( W \\) = Original width of the rectangle\n  - \\( A = L \\times W \\) = Original area of the rectangle\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n- **Option A:** Calculate the new length after a 25% increase.\n- **Option B:** Since the area remains unchanged, the product of the new length and new width should equal the original area.\n\nI think **Option B** is more direct because it directly relates the changes in length and width to the area.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the New Length After the Increase**\n\n**Calculation:**\n- The length is increased by 25%.\n- New length \\( L' = L + 0.25L = 1.25L \\)\n\n**Checking:** \nWait, that seems straightforward. A 25% increase means multiplying by 1.25. That makes sense.\n\n### **Step 3: Set Up the Equation for the Unchanged Area**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince the area remains unchanged, the product of the new length and new width should equal the original area.\n\n- **Equation:** \n  \\[\n  A' = L' \\times W' = A \\\\\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  1.25L \\times W' = L \\times W\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis equation relates the new width \\( W' \\) to the original dimensions. It looks correct because it maintains the area.\n\n### **Step 4: Solve for the New Width \\( W' \\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Divide both sides by \\( 1.25L \\) to isolate \\( W' \\):\n  \\[\n  W' = \\frac{L \\times W}{1.25L} = \\frac{W}{1.25}\n  \\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n- \\( W' = \\frac{W}{1.25} = \\frac{W}{\\frac{5}{4}} = \\frac{4W}{5} \\)\n\n**Checking:**\nHmm, dividing by 1.25 makes sense because the length increased by that factor, so the width needs to adjust accordingly to maintain the area. This seems correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Percentage Decrease in Width**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to determine by what percentage the width decreased from its original value to the new value.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Percentage Decrease Formula:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Original Width} - \\text{New Width}}{\\text{Original Width}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n  \\]\n  \n- **Applying the Values:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\left( \\frac{W - \\frac{4W}{5}}{W} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\left( \\frac{W - 0.8W}{W} \\right) \\times 100\\% = (0.2) \\times 100\\% = 20\\%\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nA 20% decrease makes sense. I reduced the width to 80% of its original value to balance the 25% increase in length and keep the area unchanged.\n\n### **Step 6: Quick Check of the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet me verify if this makes sense. The length increased by 25%, and to maintain the area, the width decreased proportionally.\n\n- **Original Area:** \\( A = L \\times W \\)\n- **New Length:** \\( L' = 1.25L \\)\n- **New Width:** \\( W' = \\frac{4W}{5} \\)\n- **New Area:** \n  \\[\n  A' = L' \\times W' = 1.25L \\times \\frac{4W}{5} = \\frac{5L \\times 4W}{5} = 4LW = A\n  \\]\n  \n**Conclusion:**\nThe new area equals the original area, confirming that the calculations are correct.\n\n### **Step 7: Alternative Approach to Verify the Solution**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\nMaybe I can use a percentage change formula directly to see if I arrive at the same percentage decrease in width.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Initial Width:** \\( W \\)\n- **New Width:** \\( \\frac{4W}{5} \\)\n\n**Using Percentage Change Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\left( \\frac{\\frac{4W}{5} - W}{W} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{0.8W - W}{W} \\right) \\times 100\\% = (-0.2) \\times 100\\% = 20\\%\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\nThis alternative approach also gives a 20% decrease, which aligns with the previous calculation. It's always good to verify using a different method.\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Confirming the Solution**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:** By using an algebraic approach and verifying with a percentage change formula, I ensured the correctness of the solution.\n- **Consistency in Results:** Both methods yielded a 20% decrease in width, confirming the accuracy.\n- **Reflection:** It's important to cross-check calculations, especially when dealing with percentage changes, to avoid common pitfalls.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe rectangle's width was decreased by **20%**.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step approach, reflecting and checking along the way, ensured a thorough understanding and accurate solution to the problem. By considering multiple strategies and validating the results, I could confidently determine the percentage decrease in the rectangle's width.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the original area be $x$. Since the area of the rectangle is length multiplied by width, increasing the length of a rectangle by 25 percent increases the area to $1.25x$. We need to multiply this area by some number $y$ to decrease it back to $x$. We have the equation $1.25xy=x\\Rightarrow y=1/1.25=.8$. So the width needs to be decreased to $.8$ times of the original in order to change the area back to the original area. Thus, the width needs to be adjusted $\\boxed{20}$ percent."
