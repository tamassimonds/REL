  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into crafting a complete and coherent solution based on the provided working out. I'll guide you through brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and finalizing the conclusion\u2014all while maintaining the original insights.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming**\n\nWhen tackling the question, \"Is it possible for a negative number to have a square root?\" my **initial reaction** is to recall basic concepts about square roots. I remember learning that squaring any real number\u2014whether positive or negative\u2014always yields a positive result. This naturally leads me to wonder, \u201cHow can a negative number have a square root if squaring always produces a positive outcome?\u201d\n\n**But wait**, there's a faint memory from my math classes about imaginary numbers. Maybe they hold the key here. Let's explore various strategies to deepen our understanding.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Thinking in Terms of Real Numbers:**\n   - **Initial Idea:** Only positive numbers have square roots since squaring always results in a positive value.\n   - **Reflection:** If that's the case, do negative numbers lack square roots entirely within the real number system?\n\n2. **Considering Imaginary Numbers:**\n   - **Another Angle:** I recall that imaginary numbers were introduced to handle the square roots of negative numbers. Perhaps this is relevant.\n   - **Reflection:** **Hmm**, this seems promising. But how exactly do imaginary numbers fit in?\n\n3. **Testing with Examples:**\n   - **Concrete Approach:** Let's square different numbers (both real and imaginary) to observe the outcomes.\n   - **Reflection:** This hands-on approach could help solidify the concept by providing concrete evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Testing Real Numbers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo start, let\u2019s square some real numbers and see the results.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- \\((-2)^2 = 4\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n**Wait a minute**, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative, the square is always positive. This confirms my initial thought: within the real number system, negative numbers don't have real square roots.\n\n**<ANSWER>Negative numbers don't have square roots in the real number system.</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Introducing Imaginary Numbers**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nSince real numbers don't provide square roots for negative numbers, perhaps it's time to consider imaginary numbers. I **vaguely** remember that the imaginary unit \\(i\\) is defined as the square root of \\(-1\\).\n\n**Exploring Further:**\n\n- **Wait**, if \\(i^2 = -1\\), then squaring \\(i\\) yields a negative number. **Oh!** This might be the key to finding square roots of negative numbers.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis feels like the right direction. Let's see how this concept applies to other negative numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying Imaginary Numbers to Negative Square Roots**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nCan we express the square root of any negative number using \\(i\\)?\n\n**Calculation Strategy:**\n\nFor a negative number \\(-a\\) (where \\(a\\) is positive), can we write its square root as \\(\\sqrt{-a} = \\sqrt{a} \\times i\\)?\n\n**Testing with an Example:**\n\nLet\u2019s take \\(\\sqrt{-4}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{-4} = \\sqrt{4} \\times i = 2i\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** If we square \\(2i\\):\n  \\[\n  (2i)^2 = 4i^2 = 4(-1) = -4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** **Yes!** Squaring \\(2i\\) returns \\(-4\\), which matches the original negative number. This confirms that using \\(i\\) works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Generalizing the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf this approach works for \\(-4\\), does it apply to any negative number?\n\n**General Formula:**\n\nFor any negative number \\(-a\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{-a} = \\sqrt{a} \\times i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis formula makes sense because squaring \\(\\sqrt{a} \\times i\\) would return \\(-a\\).\n\n**Checking with Another Example:**\n\nLet\u2019s try \\(\\sqrt{-9}\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{-9} = \\sqrt{9} \\times i = 3i\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\\[\n(3i)^2 = 9i^2 = 9(-1) = -9\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:** It works!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n**Alright**, after exploring multiple approaches:\n\n- **Real Numbers:** Negative numbers don't have square roots.\n- **Imaginary Numbers:** Introducing \\(i\\) allows us to define square roots for negative numbers.\n\n**Checking Consistency:**\n\nEach example tested confirms that using \\(i\\) provides a valid square root for negative numbers.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**<ANSWER>Yes, it is possible for a negative number to have a square root, but only within the complex number system using imaginary numbers.</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014starting with real numbers and then incorporating imaginary numbers\u2014we've determined that negative numbers do indeed have square roots, but they exist in the **complex number system**. The key lies in using the imaginary unit \\(i\\), where \\(i^2 = -1\\), to express these square roots.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **At first**, I thought negative numbers might not have square roots because squaring always yields a positive result. However, recalling the concept of imaginary numbers led me to the correct solution. By testing examples and verifying calculations, I confirmed that negative numbers do have square roots in the complex number system. **This reminds me** of the importance of extending familiar concepts beyond the real numbers to fully understand them.\n\n---\n\n**<ANSWER>Solution:</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>Yes, it is possible for a negative number to have a square root, but only within the complex number system using imaginary numbers.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Summary**\n\nThrough a step-by-step exploration, starting with real numbers and progressing to imaginary numbers, we've concluded that negative numbers have square roots in the complex number system. This approach not only confirms the existence of such square roots but also reinforces the fundamental role of imaginary numbers in extending our mathematical understanding.",
