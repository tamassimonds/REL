  "problem": "An ordinary $6$-sided die has a number on each face from $1$ to $6$ (each number appears on one face). How many ways can I paint two faces of a die red, so that the numbers on the red faces don't add up to $7$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and walk through the thought process just like we would naturally. We'll brainstorm different strategies, explore them step by step, reflect along the way, and ensure our approach is correct before finalizing the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. The question is asking how many ways we can paint two faces of a standard six-sided die red, ensuring that the numbers on those faces don't add up to 7.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This reminds me of problems involving combinations and restrictions.\n- I know that on a standard die, opposite faces add up to 7. Maybe that's relevant here.\n- I'm thinking about listing all possible pairs and then eliminating those that don't meet the criteria.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **List All Possible Pairs and Exclude Invalid Ones:** Enumerate all pairs of faces, then remove those whose numbers add up to 7.\n2. **Use Combinatorics with Constraints:** Calculate the total combinations and subtract the unwanted cases.\n3. **Symmetry Considerations:** Perhaps leverage the die's symmetry to simplify the counting.\n\nI'm leaning towards starting with the first strategy\u2014listing all possible pairs\u2014because it seems straightforward. If it gets too messy, I'll reconsider.\n\n**Actually, Scratch That:**\n- Wait a minute, listing all pairs might be tedious. Maybe I should just calculate the total combinations and subtract the invalid ones instead. Yeah, let's try that to keep things cleaner.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Total Combinations**\n\nHow many possible ways can we paint two faces of a standard six-sided die red, ensuring that the numbers on those faces don't add up to 7?\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAlright, let's start by finding the total number of ways to choose two faces to paint red on a six-sided die without any restrictions.\n\n**Wait a Second:**\n- Hmm, this reminds me of basic combinatorics where we need to find combinations of faces. Let's see how that works.\n\n**Calculation:**\nWe need to choose 2 faces out of 6, so we'll use the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total pairs} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, so there are 15 possible ways to choose two faces to paint red without considering any restrictions. But wait, let's list them to make sure I'm on the right track.\n\n> **Total Combinations:** 15\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Pairs to Exclude**\n\nNow, let's identify which pairs of faces need to be excluded because their numbers add up to 7.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI remember that on a standard die, opposite faces always add up to 7. So, I need to exclude those pairs.\n\n**Actually, Scratch That:**\n- Initially, I thought about listing all pairs, but now I realize it's more efficient to just focus on the pairs that need to be excluded.\n\n**Knowledge Recall:**\nOn a standard six-sided die, the opposite faces are:\n- 1 and 6\n- 2 and 5\n- 3 and 4\n\n**Application:**\nLet's list the pairs where the numbers add up to 7:\n\n- (1, 6)\n- (2, 5)\n- (3, 4)\n\n**Double-Checking:**\n- Wait, let me think\u2014are there any other pairs that add up to 7? No, only the opposite faces do.\n\n> **Pairs to Exclude:** 3\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Valid Combinations**\n\nAlright, now let's find the number of valid pairs by subtracting the invalid ones from the total.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure that the numbers on the painted faces don't add up to 7, I'll subtract the three invalid pairs from the total.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Valid pairs} = \\text{Total pairs} - \\text{Invalid pairs} = 15 - 3 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Hmm, this seems straightforward, but I want to make sure it's correct. Let's list the remaining valid pairs to verify.\n\n**Valid Pairs:**\n1. (1, 2)\n2. (1, 3)\n3. (1, 4)\n4. (1, 5)\n5. (1, 6) \u2192 Excluded\n6. (2, 3)\n7. (2, 4)\n8. (2, 5) \u2192 Excluded\n9. (2, 6)\n10. (3, 4) \u2192 Excluded\n11. (3, 5)\n12. (3, 6)\n13. (4, 5)\n14. (4, 6)\n15. (5, 6)\n\nAfter excluding the three invalid pairs, we're left with 12 valid pairs.\n\n> **Valid Combinations:** 12\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Validating the Approach**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's double-check our method to ensure its correctness.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Does this approach cover all possible cases?\n- Am I missing any restrictions or additional conditions?\n\n**Actually, Scratch That:**\n- Initially, I thought listing all pairs was necessary, but realizing that subtracting the invalid pairs is sufficient makes the process more efficient.\n\n**General Validation:**\n- The total number of combinations accounts for all possible pairings of faces.\n- By explicitly identifying and excluding only the pairs where the numbers add up to 7, we ensure that all remaining pairs meet the condition.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Everything seems to align correctly. The method is straightforward and doesn't overlook any cases.\n\n> **Conclusion:** The approach is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finalizing the Answer**\n\nAfter verifying the calculations and the method's validity, we can confidently state the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThere are **12** ways to paint two faces of a die red so that the numbers on the red faces don't add up to 7.\n\n<ANSWER>12</ANSWER>\n\n**Alternative Strategy Confirmation:**\n- Even if I considered using symmetry or other combinatorial methods, the result remains consistent. This reinforces the correctness of the initial approach.\n\n> **Final Decision:** The initial strategy was effective and led to the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy starting with a straightforward combinatorial approach, identifying specific constraints, and validating each step, we ensured the correctness of the solution. Regular reflections and checks throughout the process helped maintain accuracy and confirmed that the final answer is indeed **12** valid combinations.",
  "ground_truth": "I can pick one face in $6$ ways. Then, I have $4$ choices for the second face, because I can't pick the first face again, nor can I pick the unique face with which it makes $7$. So I seem to have $6\\cdot 4 = 24$ choices -- but this actually overcounts the possible results by a factor of $2$, because in the end, it doesn't matter which of the two red faces I chose first and which I chose second. So the actual number of possibilities is $24/2$, or $\\boxed{12}$.\n\nThere's another neat way to see this! If you have an ordinary die, you may notice that the pairs of numbers which add up to $7$ are all on pairs of opposite faces. (For example, the $1$ is opposite the $6$.) This means that in order to paint two faces that don't add up to $7$, I must choose any two faces that aren't opposite. Two faces that aren't opposite must share an edge, and there is exactly one pair of faces meeting along each edge of the die. Since a cube has $12$ edges, there are $\\boxed{12}$ choices I can make."
