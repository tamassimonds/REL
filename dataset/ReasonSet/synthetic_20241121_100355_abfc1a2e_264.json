  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's weave together all the elements into a coherent, step-by-step solution while maintaining the original thoughts, reflections, and strategies. This approach will ensure clarity and demonstrate the complete problem-solving process.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The problem involves variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), which are always positive.\n- It states that \\( x^2 \\) and \\( y \\) vary inversely.\n- Given: When \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 10 \\).\n- Goal: Find \\( x \\) when \\( y = 4000 \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n- Inverse variation implies that as one quantity increases, the other decreases.\n- Considering using the inverse variation formula, but noting that it involves \\( x^2 \\) instead of just \\( x \\).\n- Exploring different strategies to confirm the relationship.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Using Inverse Variation Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Recall that if two quantities vary inversely, their product remains constant.\n- Here, \\( x^2 \\) and \\( y \\) vary inversely, so \\( x^2 \\times y \\) should be constant.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Setting up an equation using the given values to find the constant.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\times y = k \\\\\n(2)^2 \\times 10 = k \\\\\n4 \\times 10 = 40 = k\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- The constant \\( k \\) is 40. This seems straightforward, but does it hold for all cases? Proceeding to verify with the new \\( y \\) value.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Rewriting the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Solving for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) by rearranging the equation.\n- This might simplify the substitution process.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- If \\( x^2 = \\frac{k}{y} \\), then \\( x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{y}} \\). Let's apply this to find \\( x \\) when \\( y = 4000 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{40}{4000} \\\\\nx^2 = 0.01 \\\\\nx = \\sqrt{0.01} = 0.1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- The value \\( x = 0.1 \\) seems reasonable. Increasing \\( y \\) should decrease \\( x^2 \\), which aligns with inverse variation.\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Cross-Multiplying**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Considering cross-multiplying to solve for \\( x \\).\n- However, since the previous method already provided a valid solution, this might be redundant.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The first strategy worked well, so no need to complicate further. Multiple strategies are useful for verification, but here, the initial approach suffices.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n#### **Step 1: Establish the Inverse Relationship**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since \\( x^2 \\) and \\( y \\) vary inversely, their product is a constant \\( k \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Calculating \\( k \\) using the given values is a logical starting point.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\times y = k \\\\\n(2)^2 \\times 10 = k \\\\\n4 \\times 10 = 40 = k\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- \\( k = 40 \\) is consistent with the given data. Ready to proceed to the next step.\n\n#### **Step 2: Set Up the Equation with the New \\( y \\) Value**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- With \\( k \\) known, use the inverse relationship to find \\( x \\) when \\( y = 4000 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Substituting the known values into the equation should yield \\( x^2 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\times 4000 = 40 \\\\\nx^2 = \\frac{40}{4000} \\\\\nx^2 = 0.01\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Dividing 40 by 4000 results in 0.01, which is correct. Moving on to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n#### **Step 3: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Taking the square root of both sides to find \\( x \\).\n- Considering only the positive root since \\( x \\) is always positive.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The square root of 0.01 is straightforward. Calculating it confirms the value of \\( x \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{0.01} = 0.1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- \\( 0.1^2 = 0.01 \\), which matches the equation. The solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Verifying that the inverse relationship holds with the calculated \\( x \\).\n- Ensuring that \\( x^2 \\times y = 40 \\) with the new values.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(0.1)^2 \\times 4000 = 0.01 \\times 4000 = 40\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The product is indeed 40, matching the constant \\( k \\). This confirms the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Final Answer: } & x = 0.1 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Recognized the problem as involving inverse variation between \\( x^2 \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Considered multiple strategies, including using the inverse variation formula and rewriting the equation. The first strategy proved effective.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Approach:** Calculated the constant \\( k \\), set up the equation with the given \\( y \\) value, and solved for \\( x \\).\n\n- **Continuous Reflection and Checking:** Verified calculations at each step to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Final Verification:** Confirmed that the inverse relationship holds with the computed value of \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:** Brainstorming different methods is beneficial. Even if the first strategy works, having alternatives helps in verification.\n\n- **Continuous Checking:** Regular checks prevent errors and ensure correctness before finalizing the solution.\n\n- **Learning from the Process:** Exploring various strategies and reflecting at each step enhances problem-solving skills, making the process more robust and reliable.\n\n---\n\nBy meticulously following this structured approach, the solution is not only correct but also thoroughly validated at each step, ensuring complete accuracy and understanding.",
