    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, brainstorming and reflecting as we go along, just like how I would naturally think through it. I'll start by exploring different strategies, checking my work often, and adjusting my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I first read the question, it reminds me of scheduling problems I've encountered before, especially those involving rounds or matchups in sports leagues. However, it's a bit more complex because there are intra-division and inter-division games with different frequencies.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n- **Intra-Division Games:** Each team plays every other team in its own division twice.\n- **Inter-Division Games:** Each team plays every team in the other division once.\n\nI think it might be helpful to calculate the number of games in each category separately and then combine them. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the most efficient way. Maybe there's a more straightforward method, but let's start with this and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Intra-Division Games**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's focus on the intra-division games first. There are two divisions with six teams each, and each team plays every other team in its division twice. This part seems more straightforward.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. **Number of Matches Within a Division:**\n   - Each team plays every other team in its division twice.\n   - But wait, counting this way might double-count each game.\n\n2. **Correct Approach:**\n   - **Combination Formula:** Use combinations to find how many unique pairs of teams can be formed in one division.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of unique pairs} = \\binom{6}{2} = 15\n     \\]\n   - Since each pair plays twice:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total intra-division games per division} = 15 \\times 2 = 30\n     \\]\n   - **Total for Both Divisions:** \n     \\[\n     30 \\times 2 = 60\n     \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\nThis seems to work because we're accounting for each unique matchup twice, once for each team's home game. **Let me double-check**: \\( \\binom{6}{2} \\) indeed calculates the number of unique pairs, and multiplying by 2 gives the total matches. So, 60 intra-division games make sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Inter-Division Games**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, let's tackle the inter-division games. Each team plays every team in the other division once. This seems less intuitive, so I need to think carefully.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. **Total Number of Teams Per Division:** 6\n2. **Each Team Plays Every Team in the Other Division Once:**\n   - So, each team has 6 inter-division games.\n   \n3. **Total Number of Inter-Division Games:**\n   - **Simple Approach:** Multiply the number of teams in one division by the number of teams in the other division.\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 6 = 36\n     \\]\n   - **Wait, Let Me Think:** This counts each game once, which is correct because each team plays each team in the opposite division once.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems correct. Each team in one division plays every team in the other division exactly once, so 36 inter-division games make sense.\n\n**Check:** Total intra-division games were 60, and inter-division games are 36. Adding them up should give the total number of games.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combining Both Intra- and Inter-Division Games**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Total games} = \\text{Intra-division games} + \\text{Inter-division games} = 60 + 36 = 96\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nAt first glance, 96 games seem reasonable. However, I want to make sure I've accounted for everything correctly. **Let me think about it:** We've considered all intra-division games (each team plays every other team twice) and all inter-division games (each team plays every team in the other division once). I don't see any overlaps or missing components.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Check and Verification**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Intra-Division Games:** 60 (30 per division playing twice)\n- **Inter-Division Games:** 36 (each team plays 6 from the other division)\n\n**Total:** \n\\[\n60 + 36 = 96\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThis total makes sense because each game's schedule should be unique (no team plays the same opponent more than necessary), and we've accounted for all required matchups.\n\n**Reflection:**\nTo ensure accuracy, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For instance, are there any playoffs or additional games outside the regular season? The question doesn't mention anything beyond the regular season games, so I think we're safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n**Total Number of Conference Games Scheduled: 96**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBy breaking down the problem into intra- and inter-division games, calculating each separately, and then combining the totals, we arrived at 96 scheduled conference games. Throughout the process, reflecting and checking each step ensured that the calculations were correct and that no component was overlooked. This methodical approach helped in accurately determining the total number of games scheduled in the Little Twelve Basketball Conference.\n\nHope this helps!
