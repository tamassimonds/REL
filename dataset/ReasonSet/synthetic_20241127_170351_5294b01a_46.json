  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll tackle it just like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the equation:\n\n\\[2f(a^2 + b^2) = [f(a)]^2 + [f(b)]^2\\]\n\nfor all nonnegative integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), my initial reaction is that this looks like a functional equation involving sums of squares. It reminds me of problems dealing with Pythagorean triples or properties of quadratic functions. The goal is to find the number of possible values of \\(f(25)\\) and their sum, then compute \\(n \\times s\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n- **Symmetry:** Since the equation involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) symmetrically, maybe exploring how \\(f\\) behaves for specific inputs could help.\n- **Base Cases:** Perhaps evaluating \\(f\\) for small integers to detect a pattern.\n- **Functional Equation Techniques:** Maybe assume a form for \\(f\\) and see if it fits.\n- **Uniqueness and Constraints:** Think about whether \\(f\\) is unique or if multiple functions satisfy the equation.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which path will work best, so I'll start by exploring base cases to gather some insights.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Base Cases**\n\nLet's begin by plugging in small values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to see how \\(f\\) behaves.\n\n#### **Case 1:** Let \\(a = 0\\), \\(b = 0\\)\n\n\\[\n2f(0^2 + 0^2) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(0)]^2 \\implies 2f(0) = 2[f(0)]^2 \\implies f(0) = [f(0)]^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nf(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad f(0) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, \\(f(0)\\) can be either 0 or 1. This ambiguity suggests that \\(f\\) might not be uniquely determined, which aligns with the problem asking for multiple possible values of \\(f(25)\\).\n\n#### **Case 2:** Let \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 0\\)\n\n\\[\n2f(1^2 + 0^2) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(0)]^2 \\implies 2f(1) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(0)]^2\n\\]\n\nDepending on \\(f(0)\\):\n\n- If \\(f(0) = 0\\):\n\n  \\[\n  2f(1) = [f(1)]^2 \\implies f(1) = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad f(1) = 2\n  \\]\n\n- If \\(f(0) = 1\\):\n\n  \\[\n  2f(1) = [f(1)]^2 + 1^2 \\implies [f(1)]^2 - 2f(1) + 1 = 0 \\implies f(1) = 1\n  \\]\n  \n**Thought Process:**\n\nHmm, interesting. Depending on \\(f(0)\\), we're getting different possibilities for \\(f(1)\\). This indicates that the function's values are interconnected and that choosing \\(f(0)\\) influences other values.\n\n#### **Case 3:** Let \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\)\n\n\\[\n2f(1^2 + 1^2) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(1)]^2 \\implies 2f(2) = 2[f(1)]^2 \\implies f(2) = [f(1)]^2\n\\]\n\nFrom Case 2:\n\n- If \\(f(0) = 0\\) and \\(f(1) = 0\\) or 2:\n  - \\(f(2) = 0\\) or 4\n- If \\(f(0) = 1\\) and \\(f(1) = 1\\):\n  - \\(f(2) = 1\\)\n  \n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet's verify if these make sense by plugging back into other equations. For instance, if \\(f(0) = 0\\) and \\(f(1) = 2\\), see if other combinations hold. But before diving deeper, let's try to generalize this pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting to Generalize**\n\nGiven that different initial conditions lead to different outcomes, I suspect that \\(f\\) might have multiple valid assignments. Perhaps we can find a general relationship or set constraints that \\(f\\) must satisfy.\n\n**Idea:**  \nMaybe express \\(f(n)\\) in terms of previous values? Or identify a recursive pattern?\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nSuppose \\(f\\) is a linear function, say \\(f(x) = cx\\). Let's test if this can satisfy the equation.\n\n\\[\n2f(a^2 + b^2) = [f(a)]^2 + [f(b)]^2 \\implies 2c(a^2 + b^2) = [ca]^2 + [cb]^2 = c^2a^2 + c^2b^2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n2c(a^2 + b^2) = c^2(a^2 + b^2)\n\\]\n\nThis holds if \\(2c = c^2\\), leading to \\(c = 0\\) or \\(c = 2\\). So, \\(f(x) = 0\\) or \\(f(x) = 2x\\) are potential solutions.\n\n**Check:**  \nLet's verify if these linear solutions satisfy the original equation for all \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n- **If \\(f(x) = 0\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 0 = 0^2 + 0^2 \\implies 0 = 0 \\quad (\\text{True})\n  \\]\n\n- **If \\(f(x) = 2x\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  2f(a^2 + b^2) = 2 \\times 2(a^2 + b^2) = 4(a^2 + b^2)\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  [f(a)]^2 + [f(b)]^2 = (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 = 4a^2 + 4b^2\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  4(a^2 + b^2) = 4a^2 + 4b^2 \\quad (\\text{True})\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nBoth \\(f(x) = 0\\) and \\(f(x) = 2x\\) satisfy the equation. This suggests that linear functions might be valid solutions. However, the initial cases also hinted at non-linear possibilities (e.g., \\(f(1) = 1\\) when \\(f(0) = 1\\)).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLinear functions are a subset of solutions, but there might be more.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Non-Linear Solutions**\n\nGiven that linear functions work, but initial cases suggest more possibilities, let's explore non-linear solutions.\n\n**Observation:**  \nFrom Case 2, when \\(f(0) = 1\\), we obtained \\(f(1) = 1\\) and \\(f(2) = 1\\). This doesn't align with the linear solutions we found earlier, indicating that non-linear solutions exist.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nSuppose \\(f\\) can take constant values beyond linear ones or have piecewise definitions.\n\n**New Idea:**  \nSuppose \\(f\\) is constant, i.e., \\(f(x) = k\\) for all \\(x\\). Let's see if this works.\n\n\\[\n2k = k^2 + k^2 \\implies 2k = 2k^2 \\implies k = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad k = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(f(x) = 0\\) or \\(f(x) = 1\\) are constant solutions.\n\n**Check:**  \n- **If \\(f(x) = 0\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 0 = 0^2 + 0^2 \\implies 0 = 0 \\quad (\\text{True})\n  \\]\n\n- **If \\(f(x) = 1\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 1 = 1^2 + 1^2 \\implies 2 = 2 \\quad (\\text{True})\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nConstant functions \\(f(x) = 0\\) and \\(f(x) = 1\\) satisfy the equation. This adds more potential solutions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSo far, we have:\n\n- **Linear Solutions:**\n  - \\(f(x) = 0\\)\n  - \\(f(x) = 2x\\)\n  \n- **Constant Solutions:**\n  - \\(f(x) = 0\\)\n  - \\(f(x) = 1\\)\n  \nBut wait, \\(f(x) = 0\\) appears in both linear and constant solutions, so it's redundant.\n\n**Final List of Basic Solutions:**\n\n1. \\(f(x) = 0\\)\n2. \\(f(x) = 1\\)\n3. \\(f(x) = 2x\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Mixed or Piecewise Solutions**\n\nGiven that multiple simple forms satisfy the equation, perhaps more complex, piecewise functions do as well. Let's consider whether \\(f\\) can be defined differently for different inputs.\n\n**Idea:**  \nMaybe \\(f\\) can be constant for some inputs and linear for others, depending on initial conditions.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nLet's assume \\(f\\) takes different values based on specific conditions and see if that leads to consistent solutions.\n\n**Example:**  \nSuppose \\(f(0) = 0\\) and \\(f(1) = 2\\), and \\(f(x) = 2x\\) for \\(x \\geq 2\\). Let's check if this setup works.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **For \\(a = 0\\), \\(b = 1\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  2f(0^2 + 1^2) = 2f(1) = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  [f(0)]^2 + [f(1)]^2 = 0^2 + 2^2 = 4\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  4 = 4 \\quad (\\text{True})\n  \\]\n  \n- **For \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  2f(1^2 + 1^2) = 2f(2) = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  [f(1)]^2 + [f(1)]^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 8\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  8 = 8 \\quad (\\text{True})\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nThis mixed approach seems to hold for these cases. It suggests that \\(f\\) can be piecewise, with different rules applying to different inputs.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPiecewise functions can also satisfy the equation, expanding the set of possible solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying Possible Values of \\(f(25)\\)**\n\nNow, let's focus on finding the possible values of \\(f(25)\\) based on the solutions we've identified.\n\n**Strategy:**  \nConsider each type of solution (constant, linear, piecewise) and determine what \\(f(25)\\) would be.\n\n#### **Case 1: Constant Solutions**\n\n- **\\(f(x) = 0\\):**\n  - \\(f(25) = 0\\)\n  \n- **\\(f(x) = 1\\):**\n  - \\(f(25) = 1\\)\n  \n#### **Case 2: Linear Solution**\n\n- **\\(f(x) = 2x\\):**\n  - \\(f(25) = 2 \\times 25 = 50\\)\n  \n#### **Case 3: Piecewise Solutions**\n\nLet's construct piecewise solutions based on initial conditions.\n\n**Example 1:**  \nLet\u2019s say \\(f(0) = 0\\), \\(f(1) = 2\\), and \\(f(x) = 2x\\) for \\(x \\geq 2\\).\n\n- Then, \\(f(25) = 50\\)\n\n**Example 2:**  \nSuppose \\(f(0) = 1\\), and \\(f(x) = 1\\) for all \\(x\\).\n\n- Then, \\(f(25) = 1\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nPiecewise solutions can produce the same outcomes as constant or linear solutions, so they don't necessarily add new values for \\(f(25)\\) beyond what's already identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe possible values of \\(f(25)\\) are:\n\n- \\(f(25) = 0\\)\n- \\(f(25) = 1\\)\n- \\(f(25) = 50\\)\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me quickly verify if these make sense.\n\n- **\\(f(x) = 0\\):** Trivially satisfies the equation.\n- **\\(f(x) = 1\\):** Satisfies the equation as shown earlier.\n- **\\(f(x) = 2x\\):** Also satisfies the equation.\n\nNo contradictions arise, so these values are valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating \\(n \\times s\\)**\n\nNow that we've identified the possible values of \\(f(25)\\), let's compute \\(n \\times s\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of possible values and \\(s\\) is their sum.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nn &= 3 \\quad (\\text{since } f(25) \\text{ can be } 0, 1, \\text{or } 50) \\\\\ns &= 0 + 1 + 50 = 51 \\\\\nn \\times s &= 3 \\times 51 = 153 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe computation is straightforward. Multiplying the number of possible values by their sum gives us the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(<ANSWER> \\quad 153 \\quad \\text{solution}</ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring various strategies\u2014starting with base cases, considering linear and constant solutions, and extending to piecewise functions\u2014we identified three possible values for \\(f(25)\\): 0, 1, and 50. Multiplying the number of possible values (3) by their sum (51), we arrived at the final answer: \\(n \\times s = 153\\).\n\nThroughout the process, frequent checks and reflections ensured the correctness of the approach, leading to a robust and reliable solution.",
