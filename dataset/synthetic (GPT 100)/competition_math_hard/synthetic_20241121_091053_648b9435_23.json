  "solution": "To determine the probability that a randomly generated sequence of ten bits (0s and 1s) does not contain two consecutive 1s, we will proceed through several structured steps.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Sequence\nLet \\( a_n \\) represent the number of valid sequences of length \\( n \\) that do not have two consecutive 1s. We aim to establish a recurrence relation to compute \\( a_n \\).\n\n### Step 2: Establishing the Recurrence Relation\nWe analyze how a valid sequence can end:\n- If it ends with a 0, the first \\( n-1 \\) digits can be any valid sequence of length \\( n-1\\), contributing \\( a_{n-1} \\).\n- If it ends with a 1, the digit before it must be 0 (to prevent consecutive 1s), allowing the first \\( n-2 \\) digits to be any valid sequence of length \\( n-2\\), contributing \\( a_{n-2} \\).\n\nThus, the recurrence relation can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Base Cases\nWe need to clarify our base cases:\n- For \\( n = 1 \\): The valid sequences are \"0\" and \"1\", hence \\( a_1 = 2 \\).\n- For \\( n = 2 \\): The valid sequences are \"00\", \"01\", and \"10\", leading to \\( a_2 = 3 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Compute Values for \\( n = 3 \\) to \\( n = 10 \\)\nNow, we can compute the values for \\( a_n \\) from \\( n = 3 \\) to \\( n = 10 \\):\n\n- \\( a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8 \\)\n- \\( a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 8 + 5 = 13 \\)\n- \\( a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 13 + 8 = 21 \\)\n- \\( a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 21 + 13 = 34 \\)\n- \\( a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 34 + 21 = 55 \\)\n- \\( a_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 55 + 34 = 89 \\)\n- \\( a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 = 89 + 55 = 144 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Total Sequences and Probability Calculation\nThe total number of bit sequences of length 10 is \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\).\n\nThe probability of not having two consecutive 1s is given by:\n\\[\nP(\\text{no consecutive 1s}) = \\frac{a_{10}}{2^{10}} = \\frac{144}{1024}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying the Probability\nTo simplify \\( \\frac{144}{1024} \\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD):\n- The prime factorization of 144 is \\( 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\).\n- The prime factorization of 1024 is \\( 2^{10} \\).\n\nThus, the GCD is \\( 2^4 = 16 \\).\n\nDividing both the numerator and denominator by 16 gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{144 \\div 16}{1024 \\div 16} = \\frac{9}{64}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation of \\( m+n \\)\nWe find \\( P(\\text{no consecutive 1s}) = \\frac{9}{64} \\), with \\( m = 9 \\) and \\( n = 64 \\). As these numbers are relatively prime, we calculate \\( m+n = 9 + 64 = 73 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{73}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let $a_n$ denote the number of sequences of length $n$ that do not contain consecutive $1$s. A sequence of length $n$ must either end in a $0$ or a $1$. If the string of length $n$ ends in a $0$, this string could have been formed by appending a $0$ to any sequence of length $n-1$, of which there are $a_{n-1}$ such strings. If the string of length $n$ ends in a $1$, this string could have been formed by appending a $01$ (to avoid consecutive $1$s) to any sequence of length $n-2$, of which there are $a_{n-2}$ such strings. Thus, we have the recursion\\[a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\\]Solving for initial conditions, we find $a_1 = 2, a_2 = 3$. Thus we have the Fibonacci sequence with shifted indices; indeed $a_n = F_{n+2}$, so $a_{10} = F_{12} = 144$. The probability is $\\frac{144}{2^{10}} = \\frac{9}{64}$, and $m+n=\\boxed{73}$."
