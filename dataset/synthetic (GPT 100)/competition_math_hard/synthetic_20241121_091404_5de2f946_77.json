  "problem": "Our school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if at most one of the triplets is in the starting lineup?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of ways to select 6 starters from a volleyball team of 14 players, where at most one of the triplets (Alicia, Amanda, and Anna) can be included, we can approach the problem by considering two distinct cases.\n\n### Team Composition\n- Total players: 14\n- Triplets: 3 (Alicia, Amanda, Anna)\n- Other players: 11 (14 - 3)\n\n### Case Analysis\nWe analyze two cases based on the inclusion of triplets:\n\n**Case 1: No triplet included**\n- We need to select all 6 starters from the 11 non-triplet players.\n- The number of ways to choose 6 from 11 is calculated using the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{6} = \\frac{11!}{6!5!} = 462\n\\]\n\n**Case 2: Exactly one triplet included**\n- First, we choose 1 triplet from the 3 available:\n\\[\n\\binom{3}{1} = 3\n\\]\n- Next, we select the remaining 5 players from the 11 non-triplet players:\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{5} = \\frac{11!}{5!6!} = 462\n\\]\n- Therefore, the total for this case is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 462 = 1386\n\\]\n\n### Total Combinations\nTo find the overall total combinations of selecting the starters, we sum the results from both cases:\n\\[\n462 \\text{ (no triplet)} + 1386 \\text{ (one triplet)} = 1848\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the total number of ways to choose 6 starters, given that at most one triplet can be included, is **1848**.",
  "ground_truth": "We can add together the number of lineups with one triplet and with no triplets.   The number of lineups with no triplets is $\\binom{11}{6} = 462$, since we must choose 6 starters from the 11 remaining players.  When one triplet is in the lineup, there are $3\\cdot \\binom{11}{5} = 1386$ options.  So the total number of lineups with at most one triplet is $1386 + 462 = \\boxed{1848}$."
