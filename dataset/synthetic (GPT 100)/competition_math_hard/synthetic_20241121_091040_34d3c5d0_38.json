  "problem": "How many interior diagonals does an icosahedron have?  (An $\\emph{icosahedron}$ is a 3-dimensional figure with 20 triangular faces and 12 vertices, with 5 faces meeting at each vertex.  An $\\emph{interior}$ diagonal is a segment connecting two vertices which do not lie on a common face.)",
  "solution": "To find the number of interior diagonals in an icosahedron, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Icosahedron Structure**: An icosahedron consists of 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces. Each vertex belongs to 5 faces.\n\n2. **Total Line Segments Calculation**: The total number of line segments connecting any two vertices is found using the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\). For 12 vertices, this is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n   \\]\n   This total includes all edges and diagonals.\n\n3. **Edge Count**: An icosahedron has 30 edges. We determine this by calculating the total number of edges from the triangular faces:\n   - Each triangular face has 3 edges. Thus, with 20 faces:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 3 = 60\n   \\]\n   Since each edge is counted twice (once for each face it belongs to), we divide by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of edges} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Face Diagonals Count**: In the case of a triangular face, there are no diagonals, as all vertices are adjacent. Thus, the number of face diagonals is 0.\n\n5. **Calculating Interior Diagonals**: Finally, we find the number of interior diagonals using:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interior diagonals} = \\text{Total line segments} - \\text{Number of edges} - \\text{Number of face diagonals}\n   \\]\n   Substituting in the known values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interior diagonals} = 66 - 30 - 0 = 36\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of interior diagonals in an icosahedron is \n\\[\n\\boxed{36}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There are 12 vertices in the icosahedron, so from each vertex there are potentially 11 other vertices to which we could extend a diagonal.  However, 5 of these 11 points are connected to the original point by an edge, so they are not connected by interior diagonals.  So each vertex is connected to 6 other points by interior diagonals.  This gives a preliminary count of $12 \\times 6 = 72$ interior diagonals.  However, we have counted each diagonal twice (once for each of its endpoints), so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcounting, and the answer is $\\dfrac{12 \\times 6}{2} = \\boxed{36}$ diagonals."
