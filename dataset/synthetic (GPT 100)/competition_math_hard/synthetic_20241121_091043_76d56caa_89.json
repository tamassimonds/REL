  "problem": "Suppose that 7 boys and 13 girls line up in a row. Let $S$ be the number of places in the row where a boy and a girl are standing next to each other. For example, for the row $\\text{GBBGGGBGBGGGBGBGGBGG}$ we have that $S=12$. The average value of $S$ (if all possible orders of these 20 people are considered) is closest to\n$\\text{(A)}\\ 9\\qquad\\text{(B)}\\ 10\\qquad\\text{(C)}\\ 11\\qquad\\text{(D)}\\ 12\\qquad\\text{(E)}\\ 13$\n",
  "solution": "To calculate the average number of adjacent boy-girl pairs, denoted as \\( S \\), in a lineup of 7 boys and 13 girls, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding \\( S \\)**: \\( S \\) counts the pairs of adjacent positions where a boy and a girl stand next to each other. In a total of 20 people (7 boys and 13 girls), there are 19 adjacent positions.\n\n2. **Counting Total Arrangements**: The total arrangements of 7 boys and 13 girls in a lineup can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total arrangements} = \\frac{20!}{7! \\times 13!}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Examining Adjacent Pairs**: Each of the 19 positions can form either a boy-girl (BG) pair or a girl-boy (GB) pair. To find the average \\( S \\), we will determine the probability of any specific adjacent pair being a boy-girl or girl-boy pairing.\n\n4. **Calculating Pair Probabilities**: For any adjacent position, we analyze two scenarios:\n   - The first position has a boy and the second has a girl.\n   - The first position has a girl and the second has a boy.\n\n   The probability that a specific adjacent pair is BG is:\n   \\[\n   P(BG) = \\frac{7}{20} \\times \\frac{13}{19}\n   \\]\n   The probability for a GB pair is:\n   \\[\n   P(GB) = \\frac{13}{20} \\times \\frac{7}{19}\n   \\]\n\n   Adding these probabilities gives the total probability for either pairing:\n   \\[\n   P(BG \\text{ or } GB) = P(BG) + P(GB) = 2 \\times \\frac{7}{20} \\times \\frac{13}{19} = \\frac{182}{380} = \\frac{91}{190}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating Expected Value \\( E(S) \\)**: Given there are 19 adjacent positions, the expected value \\( E(S) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   E(S) = 19 \\times P(BG \\text{ or } GB) = 19 \\times \\frac{91}{190}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   E(S) = \\frac{1729}{190} \\approx 9.1\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Conclusion**: The closest integer to the expected value \\( E(S) \\) is 9. Thus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "We approach this problem using Linearity of Expectation. Consider a pair of two people standing next to each other. Ignoring all other people, the probability that a boy is standing on the left position and a girl is standing on the right position is $\\frac7{20}\\cdot\\frac{13}{19}$. Similarly, if a girl is standing on the left position and a boy is standing on the right position the probability is also $\\frac{7\\cdot 13}{20\\cdot 19}$. Thus, the total probability of the two people being one boy and one girl is $\\frac{91}{190}$.\nThere are a total of 19 different adjacent pairs, so by Linearity of Expectation, we have that the expected value of $S$ is $\\frac{91}{10}$ so $\\boxed{9}$."
