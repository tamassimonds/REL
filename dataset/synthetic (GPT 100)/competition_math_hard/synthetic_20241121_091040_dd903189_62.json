  "problem": "A $2\\times 3$ rectangle and a $3\\times 4$ rectangle are contained within a square without overlapping at any interior point, and the sides of the square are parallel to the sides of the two given rectangles. What is the smallest possible area of the square?",
  "solution": "To determine the smallest possible area of a square that can contain both a \\(2 \\times 3\\) rectangle and a \\(3 \\times 4\\) rectangle without overlap, we need to evaluate various arrangements of these rectangles within the square.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Dimensions\n- **Rectangle A:** \\(2\\) (height) by \\(3\\) (width).\n- **Rectangle B:** \\(3\\) (height) by \\(4\\) (width).\n\n### Step 2: Side by Side Arrangement\nWhen placing the rectangles side by side:\n- **Total Width:** \\(3 + 4 = 7\\)\n- **Maximum Height:** \\(\\max(2, 3) = 3\\)\n\nTo accommodate this arrangement, the required side length of the square is \\(7\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 7 \\times 7 = 49\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Vertical Arrangement\nNext, if we stack the rectangles vertically:\n- **Total Height:** \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n- **Maximum Width:** \\(\\max(3, 4) = 4\\)\n\nHere, the required side length of the square would be \\(5\\) (to fit the height). Therefore, the area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 5 \\times 5 = 25\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Alternative Arrangement - Rotating Rectangles\nBy rotating the \\(2 \\times 3\\) rectangle to \\(3 \\times 2\\), we evaluate the following arrangement:\n- Place the \\(3 \\times 4\\) rectangle next to the \\(3 \\times 2\\) rectangle.\n- **Total Width:** \\(4 + 2 = 6\\)\n- **Maximum Height:** \\(\\max(3, 2) = 3\\)\n\nThis requires a square with a side length of \\(6\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 6 \\times 6 = 36\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter testing various arrangements:\n1. Side by side: Area \\(49\\)\n2. Stacked vertically: Area \\(25\\)\n3. Rotated and side by side: Area \\(36\\)\n\nThe smallest area is obtained when the rectangles are stacked vertically, resulting in a square of side \\(5\\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\text{The smallest possible area of the square is } \\boxed{25} \\text{ area units.}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The side length of the square is at least equal to the sum of the smaller dimensions of the rectangles, which is $2+3=5$.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(5,0)--(5,5)--(0,5)--cycle,dashed);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,2)--(4,2)--(4,5)--(0,5)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,2)--(3,2),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"3\",(1.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"2\",(3,1),W);\nlabel(\"3\",(4,3.5),W);\nlabel(\"4\",(2,5),S);\nlabel(\"5\",(5,2.5),E);\n[/asy]\n\nIf the rectangles are placed as shown, it is in fact possible to contain them within a square of side length 5. Thus the smallest possible area is $5^2=\\boxed{25}$."
