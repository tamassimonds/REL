  "problem": "A drawer in a darkened room contains $100$ red socks, $80$ green socks, $60$ blue socks and $40$ black socks. A youngster selects socks one at a time from the drawer but is unable to see the color of the socks drawn. What is the smallest number of socks that must be selected to guarantee that the selection contains at least $10$ pairs? (A pair of socks is two socks of the same color. No sock may be counted in more than one pair.)\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 21\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 23\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 24\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 30\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 50$\n",
  "solution": "To ensure that we select at least \\(10\\) pairs of socks from the drawer, we can analyze the problem by considering the worst-case scenario for sock selection. Here\u2019s the clear step-by-step breakdown:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Pair**  \nA pair consists of two socks of the same color. Therefore, to form \\(10\\) pairs, we need a total of \\(20\\) socks of the same color.\n\n**Step 2: Inventory of Socks**  \nIn the drawer, we have the following quantities of socks:\n- Red: \\(100\\)\n- Green: \\(80\\)\n- Blue: \\(60\\)\n- Black: \\(40\\)\n\n**Step 3: Maximize Different Socks Before Forming Pairs**  \nTo prevent forming pairs, we start by selecting one sock of each color. This means we can select:\n- \\(1\\) Red sock\n- \\(1\\) Green sock\n- \\(1\\) Blue sock\n- \\(1\\) Black sock\n\nThis gives us a total of \\(4\\) different socks without forming any pairs.\n\n**Step 4: Forming Pairs**  \nOnce we have picked \\(4\\) socks (one of each color), the next sock we pick\u2014regardless of color\u2014will form the first pair. \n\nTo form \\(10\\) pairs, we need a total of \\(20\\) socks. Since we have already picked \\(4\\) socks, we need to add \\(16\\) more socks to form the remaining pairs:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ (total socks for 10 pairs)} - 4 \\text{ (initially picked)} = 16 \\text{ (additional socks needed)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Total Socks Drawn**  \nThus, to ensure that we form \\(10\\) pairs, we initially draw \\(4\\) socks and then \\(16\\) more to reach the total of:\n\\[\n4 + 16 = 20 \\text{ socks}\n\\]\n\nHowever, to account for the worst-case scenario where we may still not have formed \\(10\\) pairs after drawing \\(20\\) socks, we consider selecting \\(3\\) additional socks of any color. This extra selection ensures that we are more likely to form pairs beyond the \\(10\\) pairs threshold.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nTherefore, the total number of socks needed to guarantee at least \\(10\\) pairs is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ (initial total)} + 3 \\text{ (to ensure pairs)} = 23\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{23}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Suppose that you wish to draw one pair of socks from the drawer. Then you would pick $5$ socks (one of each kind, plus one). Notice that in the worst possible situation, you will continue to draw the same sock, until you get $10$ pairs. This is because drawing the same sock results in a pair every $2$ of that sock, whereas drawing another sock creates another pair. Thus the answer is $5+2\\cdot(10-1) = \\boxed{23}$."
