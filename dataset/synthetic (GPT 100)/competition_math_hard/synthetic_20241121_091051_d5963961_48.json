  "problem": "Suppose the point $(1,2)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac{f(x)}2$. Then there is one point which must be on the graph of $y=\\frac{f^{-1}(x)}{2}$. What is the sum of that point's coordinates?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Given Information**: The point \\((1,2)\\) lies on the graph of \\(y = \\frac{f(x)}{2}\\). This implies that when we substitute \\(x = 1\\) into the equation, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{f(1)}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine \\(f(1)\\)**: Rearranging the equation yields:\n\n   \\[\n   f(1) = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, we find that \\(f(1) = 4\\).\n\n3. **Using the Inverse Function**: With \\(f(1) = 4\\), we apply the property of inverse functions: if \\(f(a) = b\\), then \\(f^{-1}(b) = a\\). Hence, we conclude:\n\n   \\[\n   f^{-1}(4) = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Consider the Function \\(y = \\frac{f^{-1}(x)}{2}\\)**: We will determine a point on this graph by setting \\(x = 4\\):\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{f^{-1}(4)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the point \\((4, \\frac{1}{2})\\) is on the graph of \\(y = \\frac{f^{-1}(x)}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Sum of the Coordinates**: To find the sum of the coordinates of the point \\((4, \\frac{1}{2})\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of coordinates} = 4 + \\frac{1}{2} = 4.5\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Answer**: Thus, the sum of the coordinates is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}} \\text{ or } 4.5.\n\\]\n\nIn conclusion, the final answer is \\(4.5\\).",
  "ground_truth": "Since $(1,2)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac{f(x)}2$, we know that $$2 = \\frac{f(1)}{2},$$which implies that $f(1)=4$. Therefore, $f^{-1}(4)=1$, which implies that $\\left(4,\\frac12\\right)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac{f^{-1}(x)}{2}$. The sum of this point's coordinates is $\\boxed{\\frac 92}$."
