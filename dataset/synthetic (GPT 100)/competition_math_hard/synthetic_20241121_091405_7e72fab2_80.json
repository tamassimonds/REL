  "problem": "Anthony made $5$ of his first $12$ free throw attempts. If he makes $2/3$ of his next $24$ attempts, by how many percentage points will he increase his overall success rate percentage? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of determining the impact of additional free throw attempts on Anthony's success rate, we will follow a structured approach:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Current Success Rate\n\nAnthony has made 5 successful free throws out of 12 attempts. His current success rate can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Success Rate} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Successful Attempts}}{\\text{Total Attempts}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nApplying this to Anthony's situation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Success Rate} = \\left( \\frac{5}{12} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 41.67\\%\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine Additional Attempts\n\nAnthony plans to attempt 24 more free throws and is expected to make \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of these attempts. To find the number of successful throws, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Successful Attempts} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 24 = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Successes and Attempts\n\nNow we will combine the results from both sets of attempts:\n\n- **Total Successful Attempts:**\n  \n\\[\n\\text{Total Successful Attempts} = 5 + 16 = 21\n\\]\n\n- **Total Attempts:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Attempts} = 12 + 24 = 36\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate New Success Rate\n\nNext, we calculate Anthony's new success rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Success Rate} = \\left( \\frac{21}{36} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 58.33\\%\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Increase in Success Rate\n\nFinally, we determine the increase in Anthony's success rate by subtracting the current success rate from the new success rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Increase} = \\text{New Success Rate} - \\text{Current Success Rate}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Increase} = 58.33\\% - 41.67\\% = 16.66\\%\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we find that the increase is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Increase} \\approx 17\\%\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the increase in Anthony's overall success rate percentage is:\n\n**17%**",
  "ground_truth": "If Anthony makes $2/3$ of his next $24$ attempts, he will make another $16$ free throws. Then he will have $5 + 16 = 21$ successful throws in $12 + 24 = 36$ attempts. That's a success rate of $21/36 = 7/12$, which is $58.3\\%$. His success rate before was $5/12$, which is $41.6\\%$. The increase is $58.3 - 41.6 = 16.7$, or $\\boxed{17\\%}$ to the nearest whole number."
