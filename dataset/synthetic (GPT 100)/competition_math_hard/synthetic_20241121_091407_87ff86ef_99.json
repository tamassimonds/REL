  "problem": "The center of a circle has coordinates $(6,-5)$. The circle is reflected about the line $y=x$. What are the $x,y$ coordinates of the center of the image circle? State the $x$ coordinate first.",
  "solution": "To find the coordinates of the center of the image circle after reflecting the original center across the line \\( y = x \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Reflection Properties**: The line \\( y = x \\) indicates that when a point \\( (a, b) \\) is reflected across this line, its coordinates are switched. Therefore, \\( (x, y) \\) becomes \\( (y, x) \\).\n\n2. **Original Center**: The center of the original circle is given as \\( (6, -5) \\).\n\n3. **Applying Reflection**: We reflect the point \\( (6, -5) \\):\n   - The coordinates switch from \\( (6, -5) \\) to \\( (-5, 6) \\).\n\n4. **New Coordinates**: After the reflection, the new coordinates of the center of the image circle are \\( (-5, 6) \\).\n\n5. **Final Formatting**: We present the answer with the \\( x \\) coordinate first, followed by the \\( y \\) coordinate.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>-5, 6 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The center of the image circle is simply the center of the original circle reflected over the line $y=x$. When reflecting over this line, we swap the $x$ and $y$ coordinates. Thus, the image center is the point $\\boxed{(-5, 6)}$."
