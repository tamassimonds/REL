  "problem": "I am playing a walking game with myself.  On move 1, I do nothing, but on move $n$ where $2 \\le n \\le 25$, I take one step forward if $n$ is prime and two steps backwards if the number is composite.  After all 25 moves, I stop and walk back to my original starting point.  How many steps long is my walk back?",
  "solution": "To determine the total number of steps I take during my walking game from numbers 2 to 25, I will analyze each move based on whether the number is prime or composite.\n\n1. **Definitions:**\n   - **Prime numbers** are greater than 1 and have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n   - **Composite numbers** are greater than 1 and have additional divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\n2. **Numbers from 2 to 25:**\n   The numbers in this range are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.\n\n3. **Identification of Prime and Composite Numbers:**\n   - **Prime numbers between 2 and 25:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 (Total: 9)\n   - **Composite numbers between 2 and 25:** 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25 (Total: 15)\n\n4. **Counting Steps:**\n   - For each prime number, I take **1 step forward**. Therefore, the total steps forward for primes is \\(9 \\text{ primes} \\times 1 \\text{ step} = 9 \\text{ steps forward}\\).\n   - For each composite number, I take **2 steps backward**. Thus, the steps backward for composites is \\(15 \\text{ composites} \\times 2 \\text{ steps} = 30 \\text{ steps backward}\\).\n\n5. **Net Movement Calculation:**\n   - To determine my net position, I subtract the total backward steps from the total forward steps: \\(9 \\text{ steps forward} - 30 \\text{ steps backward} = -21 \\text{ steps}\\).\n   - This means I end up 21 steps behind my starting point.\n\n6. **Walking Back to Original Position:**\n   - To return to my original position, I must take 21 steps forward.\n\nIn conclusion, the length of my walk back to the original starting point is:\n\n<ANSWER>21 steps</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We begin by counting how many prime and composite numbers there are between 2 and 25 inclusive.  The prime numbers in that range are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, so there are 9 prime numbers.  This means that there are $24 - 9 = 15$ composite numbers.\n\nFor each of the 9 prime numbers, I take one step forward, and for each of the 15 composite numbers, I take two steps back, for a net total of $9(1)+(15)(-2)=-21$ steps forward, i.e., 21 steps backwards.  Hence after 25 moves, I am 21 steps away from my original starting point, so my walk back is $\\boxed{21}$ steps long."
