  "problem": "A rectangular array of chairs is an arrangement of the chairs in rows and columns such that each row contains the same number of chairs as every other row and each column contains the same number of chairs as every other column.  If there must be at least two chairs in every row and column and all of the chairs in the room must be included, how many arrays are possible in a classroom containing $36$ chairs? Note that $12$ rows of $3$ chairs is different from $3$ rows of $12$ chairs.",
  "solution": "To determine the possible rectangular arrangements of 36 chairs, we must identify the factors of 36 while ensuring that there are at least 2 chairs in each row and each column.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the factors of 36.\n\nThe factors of 36 are as follows:\n- 1 (not allowed, as each row and column must have at least 2 chairs)\n- 2\n- 3\n- 4\n- 6\n- 9\n- 12\n- 18\n- 36\n\n### Step 2: Find valid pairs of factors.\n\nWe need to find pairs of factors (representing rows and columns) whose product equals 36 and both values are at least 2. The valid pairs are:\n1. \\( (2, 18) \\)\n2. \\( (3, 12) \\)\n3. \\( (4, 9) \\)\n4. \\( (6, 6) \\)\n5. \\( (9, 4) \\)\n6. \\( (12, 3) \\)\n7. \\( (18, 2) \\)\n\n### Step 3: Count unique configurations.\n\nEach pair \\( (r, c) \\), where \\( r \\) is the number of rows and \\( c \\) is the number of columns, represents a unique configuration. The pairs \\( (r, c) \\) and \\( (c, r) \\) are considered different, except for \\( (6, 6) \\).\n\nWe list the unique configurations:\n- \\( (2, 18) \\)\n- \\( (3, 12) \\)\n- \\( (4, 9) \\)\n- \\( (6, 6) \\)\n- \\( (9, 4) \\)\n- \\( (12, 3) \\)\n- \\( (18, 2) \\)\n\n### Total configurations\n\nEach valid pair counts as one configuration, leading to a total of:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ unique configurations.} \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total number of rectangular arrangements of 36 chairs that satisfy the requirement of having at least 2 chairs in each row and column is 7.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<7> solution</7>",
  "ground_truth": "We are counting the number of ways 36 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers such that one of the numbers is not 1. Factoring 36, we find that $36=2^2\\cdot3^2$. The possible values for the number of rows is 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 (notice that we cannot have 1 row). Each value corresponds to a unique arrangement of the chairs. Thus, there are $\\boxed{7}$ possible arrays."
