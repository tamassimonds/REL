  "problem": "How many non-congruent triangles with only integer side lengths have a perimeter of 15 units?",
  "solution": "To find the number of non-congruent triangles with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 15 units, we can follow a systematic approach:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem\nWe seek integer sides \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) such that:\n\\[\na + b + c = 15\n\\]\nand the triangle inequalities must hold:\n1. \\( a + b > c \\)\n2. \\( a + c > b \\)\n3. \\( b + c > a \\)\n\n### Step 2: Express One Side in Terms of the Others\nWe can express \\( c \\) as:\n\\[\nc = 15 - a - b\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the triangle inequalities, we derive conditions that must be satisfied:\n1. From \\( a + b > c \\): \\( a + b > 15 - a - b \\) implies \\( a + b \\geq 8 \\).\n2. From \\( a + c > b \\): \\( 15 - b > b \\) implies \\( b \\leq 7 \\).\n3. From \\( b + c > a \\): \\( 15 - a > a \\) implies \\( a \\leq 7 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine Possible Values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)\nGiven \\( a \\leq 7 \\) and \\( b \\leq 7 \\), we explore each possible value for \\( a \\) and determine valid corresponding values for \\( b \\).\n\n- **Case 1: \\( a = 1 \\)**\n  - \\( b + c = 14 \\): Only pair \\( (7, 7) \\) works.\n    - Triangle: \\( (1, 7, 7) \\)\n\n- **Case 2: \\( a = 2 \\)**\n  - \\( b + c = 13 \\): Valid pair \\( (6, 7) \\).\n    - Triangle: \\( (2, 6, 7) \\)\n\n- **Case 3: \\( a = 3 \\)**\n  - \\( b + c = 12 \\): Pairs \\( (5, 7) \\) and \\( (6, 6) \\) are valid.\n    - Triangles: \\( (3, 5, 7) \\) and \\( (3, 6, 6) \\)\n\n- **Case 4: \\( a = 4 \\)**\n  - \\( b + c = 11 \\): Pairs \\( (4, 7) \\) and \\( (5, 6) \\) work.\n    - Triangles: \\( (4, 4, 7) \\) and \\( (4, 5, 6) \\)\n\n- **Case 5: \\( a = 5 \\)**\n  - \\( b + c = 10 \\): Only pair \\( (5, 5) \\) works.\n    - Triangle: \\( (5, 5, 5) \\)\n\n- **Case 6: \\( a = 6 \\)**\n  - \\( b + c = 9 \\): Pair \\( (6, 3) \\) is redundant, already counted.\n\n- **Case 7: \\( a = 7 \\)**\n  - Not enough values left for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n### Step 4: Collect Unique Triangles\nThe unique non-congruent triangles found are:\n1. \\( (1, 7, 7) \\)\n2. \\( (2, 6, 7) \\)\n3. \\( (3, 5, 7) \\)\n4. \\( (3, 6, 6) \\)\n5. \\( (4, 4, 7) \\)\n6. \\( (4, 5, 6) \\)\n7. \\( (5, 5, 5) \\)\n\n### Final Count\nThus, there are **7 unique non-congruent triangles** with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 15.\n\nFinal answer: **7**.",
  "ground_truth": "In a triangle, the lengths of any two sides must add up to a value larger than the third length's side.  This is known as the Triangle Inequality.  Keeping this in mind, we list out cases based on the length of the shortest side.\n\nCase 1:  shortest side has length $1$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $7$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{1,7,7\\}$.\n\nCase 2:  shortest side has length $2$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $6$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{2,6,7\\}$.\n\nCase 3:  shortest side has length $3$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $6$ and $6$ or $5$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{3,6,6\\}$ and $\\{3,5,7\\}$.\n\nCase 4:  shortest side has length $4$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $5$ and $6$ or $4$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{4,5,6\\}$ and $\\{4,4,7\\}$.\n\nCase 5:  shortest side has length $5$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $5$ and $5$.  This leads to the set $\\{5,5,5\\}$.\n\nHence there are $\\boxed{7}$ sets of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of $15$ units."
