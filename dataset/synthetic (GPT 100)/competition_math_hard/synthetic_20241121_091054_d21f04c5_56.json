  "problem": "How many of the integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive, can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers?\n",
  "solution": "To determine how many integers between 1 and 1000 can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers, we start from the difference of squares formula:\n\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\n\\]\n\nLet \\(x = a - b\\) and \\(y = a + b\\). The values \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must have the same parity (both even or both odd), which means their product \\(xy\\) shares this attribute as well.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Odd Integers**: Any integer \\(n\\) that is odd can be expressed as the product of two odd integers, so any odd integer can be represented as a difference of squares.\n  \n2. **Even Integers**: For even integers, we consider two cases:\n   - **Multiples of 4**: If \\(n\\) is a multiple of 4 (i.e., \\(n = 4k\\)), it can be expressed as the difference of two squares.\n   - **Even numbers of the form \\(4k + 2\\)**: These cannot be expressed as the difference of squares.\n\n### Counting the Valid Integers:\n1. **Counting Odd Integers Between 1 and 1000**:\n   The odd integers in this range are \\(1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 999\\). This forms an arithmetic series with:\n   - First term \\(a = 1\\)\n   - Common difference \\(d = 2\\)\n\n   The number of odd integers is given by:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{999 - 1}{2} + 1 = 500\n\\]\n\n2. **Counting Even Integers that are Multiples of 4 Between 1 and 1000**:\n   The multiples of 4 in this range are \\(4, 8, 12, \\ldots, 1000\\). This also forms an arithmetic series with:\n   - First term \\(a = 4\\)\n   - Common difference \\(d = 4\\)\n\n   The number of multiples of 4 is:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{1000 - 4}{4} + 1 = 250\n\\]\n\n### Total Count of Valid Integers:\nAdding the counts of odd integers and even integers that are multiples of 4 yields the total number of integers between 1 and 1000 that can be expressed as a difference of squares:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = \\text{Number of odd integers} + \\text{Number of multiples of 4} = 500 + 250 = 750\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of integers between 1 and 1000 that can be expressed as the difference of squares of two nonnegative integers is \n\n\\(\\boxed{750}\\).\n\n<ANSWER>750</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Notice that all odd numbers can be obtained by using $(a+1)^2-a^2=2a+1,$ where $a$ is a nonnegative integer. All multiples of $4$ can be obtained by using $(b+1)^2-(b-1)^2 = 4b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. Numbers congruent to $2 \\pmod 4$ cannot be obtained because squares are $0, 1 \\pmod 4.$ Thus, the answer is $500+250 = \\boxed{750}.$"
