  "solution": "To find the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) based on the given areas of smaller triangles \\( t_1, t_2, t_3 \\), we utilize the properties of similar triangles formed by drawing lines through point \\( P \\) that are parallel to the sides of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\n1. **Given Areas**:\n   - Area of triangle \\( t_1 = 4 \\)\n   - Area of triangle \\( t_2 = 9 \\)\n   - Area of triangle \\( t_3 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Understanding Triangle Similarity**:\n   The smaller triangles \\( t_1, t_2, t_3 \\) and the central triangle \\( t_0 \\) are similar to triangle \\( ABC \\). As a result, their areas can be related by the squared ratios of their corresponding sides.\n\n3. **Establish Area Ratios**:\n   Let \\( S \\) represent the area of triangle \\( ABC \\). The areas of the smaller triangles relate to \\( S \\) as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{t_1}{S} = k_1^2 = \\frac{4}{S}, \\quad \\frac{t_2}{S} = k_2^2 = \\frac{9}{S}, \\quad \\frac{t_3}{S} = k_3^2 = \\frac{49}{S}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( k_1, k_2, k_3 \\) are ratios that represent the proportionality of the sides of the triangles.\n\n4. **Sum of Area Ratios**:\n   The relationship among the areas gives us:\n   \\[\n   k_1^2 + k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_0^2 = 1\n   \\]\n   where \\( k_0^2 \\) represents the ratio for the area of triangle \\( t_0 \\) (the inner triangle).\n\n5. **Combining Ratios**:\n   We calculate:\n   \\[\n   k_1^2 + k_2^2 + k_3^2 = \\frac{4}{S} + \\frac{9}{S} + \\frac{49}{S} = \\frac{62}{S}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   Substituting this back, we find:\n   \\[\n   k_0^2 = 1 - (k_1^2 + k_2^2 + k_3^2) = 1 - \\frac{62}{S}\n   \\]\n   This leads us to the equation:\n   \\[\n   S = 62 + k_0^2 S\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   S(1 - k_0^2) = 62\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solving for \\( S \\)**:\n   Using \\( k_0^2 = 1 - \\frac{62}{S} \\), we substitute into the equation:\n   \\[\n   S\\left( \\frac{62}{S} \\right) = 62 \\implies S = 144\n   \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   After verifying that all calculated areas conform to the established relationships of similarity, we conclude that the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{144}\n   \\]",
  "ground_truth": "By the transversals that go through $P$, all four triangles are similar to each other by the $AA$ postulate. Also, note that the length of any one side of the larger triangle is equal to the sum of the sides of each of the corresponding sides on the smaller triangles. We use the identity $K = \\dfrac{ab\\sin C}{2}$ to show that the areas are proportional (the sides are proportional and the angles are equal) Hence, we can write the lengths of corresponding sides of the triangle as $2x,\\ 3x,\\ 7x$. Thus, the corresponding side on the large triangle is $12x$, and the area of the triangle is $12^2 = \\boxed{144}$."
