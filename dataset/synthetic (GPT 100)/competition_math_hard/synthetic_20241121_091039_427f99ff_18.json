  "problem": "My three friends and I have dinner together every weekend. Each weekend, two of us cook and the other two clean up afterwards. How many different ways are there for us to choose who cooks and who cleans?",
  "solution": "To determine how many different ways you and your three friends can decide who cooks and who cleans, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total Participants**: There are 4 friends in total, including you.\n\n2. **Choosing Cooks**: We need to select 2 out of these 4 friends to take on the cooking duties. The number of combinations can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combinations} = \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n   \\]\n   where \\(n\\) is the total number of friends (4) and \\(k\\) is the number of cooks to be chosen (2).\n\n   Plugging in the values gives us:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, calculating the factorials:\n\n   \\[\n   4! = 24 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2! = 2\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n\n   This means there are 6 different ways to choose which 2 friends will cook.\n\n3. **Identifying Cleaners**: Once the cooks are chosen, the remaining 2 friends will automatically take on the cleaning responsibilities. Therefore, there is no need for additional selection for the cleaners.\n\n4. **Total Arrangements**: Since each unique selection of cooks corresponds directly to a unique pair of cleaners, the total number of ways to organize cooking and cleaning duties is the same as the number of ways to choose the cooks.\n\nThus, the total number of different ways for the group to decide cooking and cleaning roles is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**: <ANSWER>6 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "There are four ways to choose the first cook and three ways to choose the second cook, but this counts every pair of cooks twice since order doesn't matter. Once the cooks are chosen, the two people left over are the cleaners. So, there are $(4\\cdot 3)/2=\\boxed{6}$ ways for us to choose who cooks and who cleans."
