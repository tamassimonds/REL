  "problem": "Compute the exact value of the expression $\\left|\\pi - | \\pi - 7 | \\right|$.  Write your answer using only integers and $\\pi$, without any absolute value signs.",
  "solution": "To evaluate the expression \\(\\left|\\pi - | \\pi - 7 | \\right|\\), we'll proceed in a systematic manner:\n\n**Step 1: Compute \\( |\\pi - 7| \\).**\n\nSince \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14\\), we find that:\n\\[\n\\pi - 7 \\approx 3.14 - 7 = -3.86.\n\\]\nTherefore, the absolute value is:\n\\[\n|\\pi - 7| = 7 - \\pi.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute into the original expression.**\n\nNow, we substitute \\( |\\pi - 7| \\) back into the expression:\n\\[\n\\left|\\pi - | \\pi - 7 | \\right| = |\\pi - (7 - \\pi)|.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify \\( \\pi - (7 - \\pi) \\).**\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\n\\pi - (7 - \\pi) = \\pi - 7 + \\pi = 2\\pi - 7.\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate \\( |2\\pi - 7| \\).**\n\nNext, we need to determine:\n\\[\n|2\\pi - 7|.\n\\]\nSince \\(2\\pi \\approx 6.28\\), we see that:\n\\[\n2\\pi - 7 \\approx 6.28 - 7 = -0.72.\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n|2\\pi - 7| = 7 - 2\\pi.\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: State the final answer.**\n\nPutting this all together, we find:\n\\[\n\\left|\\pi - | \\pi - 7 | \\right| = |2\\pi - 7| = 7 - 2\\pi.\n\\]\n\nIn conclusion, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7 - 2\\pi}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "We begin by examining the quantity $|\\pi - 7|$.  Since $\\pi$ is less than 4, clearly $\\pi-7$ will be negative.  Hence we must negate this quantity to obtain its absolute value, which is always positive.  In other words, \\[ |\\pi - 7| = -(\\pi - 7) = 7- \\pi. \\]Continuing, we next consider the expression $\\pi-|\\pi - 7|$, which reduces to $2\\pi - 7$ in light of the above computation.  Since $\\pi$ is less than 3.5, this quantity is also negative.  Hence we must negate it just as before when taking absolute value, leading to our final answer of $\\boxed{7-2\\pi}.$"
