  "problem": "How many points of intersection are there between the graphs of the following equations: \\begin{align*}\ny &=|2x + 5|, \\\\\ny &= -|3x - 2|\n\\end{align*}",
  "solution": "To determine the points of intersection between the equations:\n\n\\[\ny = |2x + 5|\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -|3x - 2|\n\\]\n\nwe set the two expressions for \\( y \\) equal to each other:\n\n\\[\n|2x + 5| = -|3x - 2|\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Absolute Values\n\nThe left side, \\( |2x + 5| \\), is always non-negative (greater than or equal to zero):\n\n\\[\n|2x + 5| \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nThe right side, \\( -|3x - 2| \\), is always non-positive (less than or equal to zero):\n\n\\[\n-|3x - 2| \\leq 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Conditions for Equality\n\nFor the equation \\( |2x + 5| = -|3x - 2| \\) to hold, both sides must equal zero because one side cannot be positive while the other is negative. Thus, we require:\n\n\\[\n|2x + 5| = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -|3x - 2| = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve Each Absolute Value Equation\n\n1. **Solving \\( |2x + 5| = 0 \\)**:\n\n   \\[\n   2x + 5 = 0 \\implies 2x = -5 \\implies x = -\\frac{5}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solving \\( -|3x - 2| = 0 \\)**:\n\n   \\[\n   |3x - 2| = 0 \\implies 3x - 2 = 0 \\implies 3x = 2 \\implies x = \\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Compare Solutions\n\nThe values we found are:\n- From \\( |2x + 5| = 0 \\): \\( x = -\\frac{5}{2} \\)\n- From \\( -|3x - 2| = 0 \\): \\( x = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n\nSince \\( -\\frac{5}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) are different values and do not coincide, this indicates that there is no single \\( x \\) that satisfies both absolute value equations simultaneously.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBecause there are no common solutions for \\( x \\), we conclude that there are no points of intersection between the two graphs.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>0 solutions</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The first function has a minimum value of 0, while the second has a maximum of 0.  Also, their zeros occur at different spots (in the former case, at $x = -\\frac{5}{2}$, in the latter, at $x = \\frac{2}{3}$).  Hence their graphs do not intersect, so our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$"
