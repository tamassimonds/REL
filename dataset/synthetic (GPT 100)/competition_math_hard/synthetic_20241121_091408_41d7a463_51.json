  "problem": "Contractor Steve agreed to complete a job in 30 days. After 6 days he found that the 8 people assigned to the work had already done $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the job. If everyone works at the same rate, what is the least number of people he must keep on the job to ensure that the job will be completed on time?",
  "solution": "To determine how many people need to stay on the job to complete it on time after 6 days, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Total Work\nThe entire job is defined as 1 unit of work, which needs to be finished in 30 days.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Work Done in the First 6 Days\nIn the first 6 days, 8 workers completed \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the job. This means:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work done} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nThus, the remaining work is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining work} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine Time Left\nAfter 6 days of work, there are:\n\n\\[\n30 - 6 = 24 \\text{ days remaining}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Work Rate of 8 People\nThe 8 workers completed \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the job over 6 days, resulting in a work rate of:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work rate of 8 people} = \\frac{1/3}{6} = \\frac{1}{18} \\text{ units per day}\n\\]\n\nTo find the work rate for one person, we divide this by 8:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work rate of 1 person} = \\frac{1/18}{8} = \\frac{1}{144} \\text{ units per day}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Set up the Equation for People Needed\nLet \\(n\\) be the number of people required to finish the remaining \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) units in 24 days. The work rate for \\(n\\) workers is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work rate of } n \\text{ people} = n \\cdot \\frac{1}{144}\n\\]\n\nOver 24 days, they must complete \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the work:\n\n\\[\n24 \\cdot \\left(n \\cdot \\frac{1}{144}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\(n\\)\nThis equation can be simplified:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24n}{144} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6 results in:\n\n\\[\nn = 4\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nTo ensure the job is completed on time, Steve needs to keep at least 4 people working.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>4 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "There are 24 days left, which is 4 times what has already happened. Thus, if Steve keeps all 8 workers, they'll do $4\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}$ of the job in these 24 days. He only needs $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the job done in these 24 days, or half of $\\frac{4}{3}$, so he must keep at least half of his workers: $\\boxed{4}$."
