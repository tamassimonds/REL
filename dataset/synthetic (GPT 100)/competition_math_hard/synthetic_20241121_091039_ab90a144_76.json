  "problem": "At the end of a professional bowling tournament, the top 5 bowlers have a playoff. First #5 bowls #4. The loser receives $5$th prize and the winner bowls #3 in another game. The loser of this game receives $4$th prize and the winner bowls #2. The loser of this game receives $3$rd prize and the winner bowls #1. The winner of this game gets 1st prize and the loser gets 2nd prize. In how many orders can bowlers #1 through #5 receive the prizes?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 10\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 24\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 120\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{none of these}$\n",
  "solution": "To determine the number of possible orders in which bowlers #1 through #5 can receive prizes based on the described playoff structure, we can break down the process as follows:\n\n1. **Playoff Structure Overview**: The playoff consists of four matches:\n   - Match 1: Bowler #5 vs. Bowler #4\n   - Match 2: Winner of Match 1 vs. Bowler #3\n   - Match 3: Winner of Match 2 vs. Bowler #2\n   - Match 4: Winner of Match 3 vs. Bowler #1\n\n2. **Match Outcomes**: Each match can end in one of two ways, with one bowler winning and advancing, while the other is eliminated and assigned a prize according to their position in the sequence:\n   - Match 1 has 2 outcomes (either #4 or #5 wins).\n   - Match 2 also has 2 outcomes (either the winner of Match 1 or #3 wins).\n   - Match 3 has 2 outcomes (the winner of Match 2 or #2 wins).\n   - Match 4 has 2 outcomes (the winner of Match 3 or #1 wins).\n\n3. **Total Combinations Calculation**: Since each of the four matches can result in 2 distinct outcomes, the total combinations of outcomes can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16\n   \\]\n\n4. **Prize Assignments**: The prizes are assigned based on the outcomes:\n   - The loser of Match 1 receives 5th place.\n   - The loser of Match 2 receives 4th place.\n   - The loser of Match 3 receives 3rd place.\n   - The loser of Match 4 receives 2nd place.\n   - The winner of Match 4 receives 1st place.\n\nEvery match ultimately determines the ranking of all bowlers based on these outcomes.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the total number of different orders in which bowlers #1 through #5 can receive their prizes, as dictated by the playoff structure, is 16.\n\nFinal answer: **16**",
  "ground_truth": "We have $2$ choices for who wins the first game, and that uniquely determines $5^{\\text{th}}$ place. Then there are $2$ choices for a next game and that uniquely determines $4^{\\text{th}}$ place, followed by $2$ choices for the next game that uniquely determines $3^{\\text{rd}}$ place. Finally, there are $2$ choices for the last game, which uniquely determines both $1^{\\text{st}}$ and $2^{\\text{nd}}$ places, since the winner is $1^{\\text{st}}$ and the loser is $2^{\\text{nd}}$. Thus the number of possible orders is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = \\boxed{16}$."
