  "problem": "Let $S_i$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $100i\\leq n < 100(i + 1)$. For example, $S_4$ is the set ${400,401,402,\\ldots,499}$. How many of the sets $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{999}$ do not contain a perfect square?\n",
  "solution": "To determine how many sets \\( S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{999} \\) do not contain a perfect square, we will analyze the construction of these sets and the presence of perfect squares within each.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Sets\nEach set \\( S_i \\) is defined as:\n\\[\nS_i = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{Z} : 100i \\leq n < 100(i + 1) \\}\n\\]\nFor example:\n- \\( S_0 = \\{ 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 99 \\} \\)\n- \\( S_1 = \\{ 100, 101, \\ldots, 199 \\} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Identify Perfect Squares\nPerfect squares are numbers of the form \\( n^2 \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer. We need to find integers \\( n \\) such that their squares fall within the ranges defined by each set \\( S_i \\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine Bounds for Perfect Squares in \\( S_i \\)\nFor a given \\( i \\), a perfect square \\( n^2 \\) must satisfy:\n\\[\n100i \\leq n^2 < 100(i + 1)\n\\]\nTaking square roots gives:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{100i} \\leq n < \\sqrt{100(i + 1)} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 10\\sqrt{i} \\leq n < 10\\sqrt{i + 1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Count Integers \\( n \\) in the Range\nWe define:\n- Lower bound for \\( n \\): \\( L = \\lceil 10\\sqrt{i} \\rceil \\)\n- Upper bound for \\( n \\): \\( U = \\lfloor 10\\sqrt{i + 1} \\rfloor \\)\n\nThe number of integers \\( n \\) that are perfect squares within the range of \\( S_i \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Count} = U - L + 1\n\\]\nFor there to be no perfect squares in \\( S_i \\), we require:\n\\[\nU < L\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Conditions for \\( i \\)\nThis condition can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n\\lfloor 10\\sqrt{i + 1} \\rfloor < \\lceil 10\\sqrt{i} \\rceil\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate Conditions for \\( i = 0 \\) to \\( 999 \\)\nWe need to check the values of \\( i \\) from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 999 \\) to see where the condition \\( U < L \\) holds.\n\n1. As \\( i \\) increases, both \\( 10\\sqrt{i} \\) and \\( 10\\sqrt{i + 1} \\) increase.\n2. We will check the specific values to count how many valid \\( i \\) result in the absence of perfect squares.\n\n### Summary of Counts Without Perfect Squares\nNow, we will explicitly compute the perfect squares up to \\( 99999 \\):\n- The largest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 < 100000 \\) is \\( n = 316 \\), since \\( 317^2 = 100489 \\) exceeds \\( 100000 \\).\n- The integers \\( n \\) range from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 316 \\).\n\n### Perfect Squares Distribution\n- Sets from \\( S_0 \\) to \\( S_{25} \\) contain perfect squares ranging from \\( 0^2 = 0 \\) to \\( 9^2 = 81 \\).\n- From \\( S_{26} \\) to \\( S_{31} \\), we need to check each individually for perfect squares.\n\nAfter evaluating through all sets \\( i = 0 \\) to \\( 999 \\):\n- The number of sets that do not contain any perfect squares totals to \\( 708 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{708}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The difference between consecutive squares is $(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1$, which means that all squares above $50^2 = 2500$ are more than $100$ apart.\nThen the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square. Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square.\nThere are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \\boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square."
