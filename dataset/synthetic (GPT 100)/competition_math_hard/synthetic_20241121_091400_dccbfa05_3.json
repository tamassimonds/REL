  "solution": "To find the perimeter of the region bounded by the semicircular arcs on the sides of a square, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Identify the square's dimensions:\nThe sides of the square measure \\( \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\).\n\n### 2. Determine the radius of the semicircles:\nEach semicircular arc is constructed on one side of the square, with the radius \\( r \\) equal to half the length of the side. Thus:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\pi} = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\n\\]\n\n### 3. Calculate the circumference of a full circle:\nThe circumference \\( C \\) of a full circle is given by:\n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r \n\\]\n\nSubstituting for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\right) = 2\n\\]\n\n### 4. Find the length of one semicircular arc:\nThe length \\( L \\) of a semicircular arc is half the circumference:\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{C}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\n### 5. Total perimeter of the region:\nSince there are four semicircular arcs (one on each side of the square), the total perimeter \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = 4 \\cdot L = 4 \\cdot 1 = 4\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe total perimeter of the region bounded by the semicircular arcs is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since the square has side length $2/\\pi$,  the diameter of each circular section is $2/\\pi$. The boundary of the region consists of  4 semicircles, whose total perimeter is twice the circumference of a  circle having  diameter $2/\\pi$. Hence the perimeter of the region is \\[\n2\\cdot \\left(\\pi\\cdot \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right) = \\boxed{4}.\n\\]"
