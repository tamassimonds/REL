  "problem": "There are $20n$ members in the Trumpington marching band, and when they line up in rows of 26, there are 4 band members left over. If $n$ is an integer and there are fewer than 1000 band members, what is the maximum number of people that could be in the Trumpington marching band?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of members in the Trumpington marching band, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Total Members**:\n   The number of band members is given by \\(20n\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer. We know that when arranged in rows of 26, there are 4 members left over, expressed as:\n   \\[\n   20n \\equiv 4 \\mod 26\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rearranging the Equation**:\n   Rearranging the congruence, we have:\n   \\[\n   20n - 4 \\equiv 0 \\mod 26 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 20n \\equiv 4 \\mod 26\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the Congruence**:\n   We can simplify this congruence by dividing both sides by 4:\n   \\[\n   5n \\equiv 1 \\mod 13\n   \\]\n   To solve for \\(n\\), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 13.\n\n4. **Finding the Inverse**:\n   Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, or by testing values, we find:\n   \\[\n   5 \\cdot 8 \\equiv 40 \\equiv 1 \\mod 13\n   \\]\n   Thus, the inverse of 5 modulo 13 is 8.\n\n5. **Determining \\(n\\)**:\n   Multiplying both sides of the equation \\(5n \\equiv 1 \\mod 13\\) by 8 gives us:\n   \\[\n   n \\equiv 8 \\mod 13\n   \\]\n   This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   n = 8 + 13k \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculating Total Members**:\n   Substituting back into the expression for the number of members, we get:\n   \\[\n   20n = 20(8 + 13k) = 160 + 260k\n   \\]\n\n7. **Applying Restrictions**:\n   We know there are fewer than 1000 members, so:\n   \\[\n   160 + 260k < 1000\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   260k < 840 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k < \\frac{840}{260} \\approx 3.23\n   \\]\n   Thus, the valid integer values for \\(k\\) are 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n8. **Finding Maximum Members**:\n   To find the total number of members for the maximum value of \\(k\\):\n   - If \\(k = 3\\):\n     \\[\n     20n = 160 + 260 \\cdot 3 = 160 + 780 = 940\n     \\]\n\n9. **Conclusion**:\n   Therefore, the maximum number of members in the Trumpington marching band is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{940}\n   \\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since there are 4 band members left over when they line up in rows of 26, we have $20n \\equiv 4\\pmod{26}$. We divide both sides of the congruence by 4, remembering that we have to divide 26 by the greatest common divisor of 4 and 26. The original congruence is equivalent to \\[\n5n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]So we would like to find a multiple of 13 which is one less than a multiple of 5. Noticing that $13\\cdot 3$ has a units digit of 9, we identify $(13\\cdot 3 + 1)/5 =8$ as the inverse of 5 (mod 13). Multiplying both sides of our congruence by 8 gives \\[\nn \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]We have found that $n$ satisfies the conditions given in the problem if $n=8+13k$ for some positive integer $k$ and $20n<1000$. Rewriting the inequality $20n<1000$ as $n<50$, we solve $8+13k < 50$ to find that the maximum solution is $k=\\lfloor 42/13\\rfloor = 3$. When $k=3$, the number of band members is $20(8+13(3))=\\boxed{940}$."
