  "problem": "A circle with a radius of 2 units has its center at $(0, 0)$. A circle with a radius of 7 units has its center at $(15, 0)$. A line tangent to both circles intersects the $x$-axis at $(x, 0)$ to the right of the origin. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To find the point where the tangent line to both circles intersects the x-axis, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Circles**:\n   - Circle 1: Center at \\((0,0)\\), Radius \\( r_1 = 2 \\) \n     \\[\n     x^2 + y^2 = 4\n     \\]\n   - Circle 2: Center at \\((15,0)\\), Radius \\( r_2 = 7 \\)\n     \\[\n     (x - 15)^2 + y^2 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Tangent Line**:\n   Let the slope of the tangent line be \\( m \\) and the y-intercept be \\( b \\). The goal is to create equations that relate \\( m \\) and \\( b \\) based on the condition of tangency from the centers of both circles to the line.\n\n3. **Calculate Distances**:\n   - For Circle 1 (Centred at \\((0,0)\\)):\n     The distance from the center to the line is set to equal the radius \\( r_1 \\):\n     \\[\n     d_1 = \\frac{|b|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}} = 2 \\implies |b| = 2\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}\n     \\]\n   - For Circle 2 (Centred at \\((15,0)\\)):\n     The distance is also set to equal the radius \\( r_2 \\):\n     \\[\n     d_2 = \\frac{|15m - b|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}} = 7 \\implies |15m - b| = 7\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Set Up Equations**:\n   We have two scenarios for \\( b \\) based on the absolute value condition from Circle 1. First, using \\( b = 2\\sqrt{m^2 + 1} \\):\n   \\[\n   15m - 2\\sqrt{m^2 + 1} = 7\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   15m = 9\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}\n   \\]\n   Squaring both sides yields:\n   \\[\n   225m^2 = 81(m^2 + 1) \\implies 144m^2 = 81 \\implies m^2 = \\frac{81}{144} \\implies m = \\frac{3}{4}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find \\( b \\)**:\n   Substituting \\( m = \\frac{3}{4} \\) back into the equation for \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   b = 2\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 + 1} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16} + 1} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Write the Tangent Line Equation**:\n   The equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{5}{2}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Find Intersection with the x-axis**:\n   For intersection with the x-axis, set \\( y = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   0 = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{5}{2}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4}x = -\\frac{5}{2} \\implies x = -\\frac{20}{6} = -\\frac{10}{3}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( b \\) can also be negative, let\u2019s check \\( b = -2\\sqrt{m^2 + 1} \\).\n\n8. **Using \\( b = -2\\sqrt{m^2 + 1} \\)**:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{3}{4}x - \\frac{5}{2}\n   \\]\n   Setting \\( y = 0 \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   0 = \\frac{3}{4}x - \\frac{5}{2} \\implies x = \\frac{20}{6} = \\frac{10}{3}\n   \\]\n\n9. **Conclusion**:\n   Therefore, the point where the tangent line intersects the x-axis is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\frac{10}{3}}\n   \\]",

Notice that the angles at the $x$ axis are vertical angles and are also congruent.  So, these two triangles are similar, and we can set up a ratio: $$\\frac{x}{15-x}=\\frac{2}{7}$$ $$7x=30-2x$$ $$9x=30$$ $$x=\\boxed{\\frac{10}{3}}$$"
