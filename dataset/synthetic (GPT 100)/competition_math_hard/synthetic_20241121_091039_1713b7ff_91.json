  "solution": "To solve the problem, we need to find the ratio of the unit price of Brand X soda to that of Brand Y soda.\n\n1. **Information Overview**:  \n   - Brand X sells 20% more soda than Brand Y and has a price that is 10% lower than Brand Y's price.\n   - Let \\( P \\) be the price of Brand Y.\n   - Let \\( V \\) be the volume of Brand Y soda (in liters).\n\n2. **Price of Brand X**:  \n   - The price of Brand X is 10% less than Brand Y's price:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Price of Brand X} = P - 0.1P = 0.9P\n     \\]\n\n3. **Volume of Brand X**:  \n   - Brand X offers 20% more soda than Brand Y:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Volume of Brand X} = V + 0.2V = 1.2V\n     \\]\n\n4. **Unit Price Calculation**:  \n   - The unit price is defined as the price divided by the volume.\n   - For Brand Y:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Unit Price of Brand Y} = \\frac{P}{V}\n     \\]\n   - For Brand X:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Unit Price of Brand X} = \\frac{0.9P}{1.2V}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Ratio of Unit Prices**:  \n   - We calculate the ratio of the unit price of Brand X to that of Brand Y:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Unit Price of Brand X}}{\\text{Unit Price of Brand Y}} = \\frac{\\frac{0.9P}{1.2V}}{\\frac{P}{V}} \n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this gives:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{0.9P \\cdot V}{1.2V \\cdot P} = \\frac{0.9}{1.2}\n     \\]\n   - Reducing \\( \\frac{0.9}{1.2} \\):  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{0.9 \\div 0.3}{1.2 \\div 0.3} = \\frac{3}{4}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:  \n   - Therefore, the ratio of the unit price of Brand X soda to the unit price of Brand Y soda is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER> \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let $v$ be the volume of soda in Brand Y, and let $p$ be the price of Brand Y soda. Thus, the volume of soda in Brand X is $1.2v$, and the price of Brand X soda is $.9p$.\n\nIt follows that the unit price of Brand X soda is $.9p/1.2v = 3p/4v$, and the unit price of Brand Y soda is $p/v$. The ratio of these unit prices is: $$\\dfrac{\\dfrac{3p}{4v}}{\\dfrac{p}{v}} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.$$"
