  "problem": "A regular hexagon is inscribed in a circle and another regular hexagon is circumscribed about the same circle. What is the ratio of the area of the larger hexagon to the area of the smaller hexagon? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To determine the ratio of the area of a larger hexagon (circumscribed) to that of a smaller hexagon (inscribed) within the same circle, we can follow a systematic approach:\n\n### Step 1: Geometry Overview\n\n- **Inscribed Hexagon**: This hexagon lies entirely within the circle, with its vertices touching the circle. Its radius is denoted as \\( r \\).\n- **Circumscribed Hexagon**: This hexagon surrounds the circle, with each side being tangent to the circle. The distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of a side equals \\( r \\).\n\n### Step 2: Area of the Inscribed Hexagon\n\nThe formula for the area \\( A \\) of a regular hexagon with side length \\( s \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\n\\]\n\nFor the inscribed hexagon, the side length is equal to the radius:\n\n\\[\ns = r\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the inscribed hexagon is:\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{inscribed}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} r^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Area of the Circumscribed Hexagon\n\nFor the circumscribed hexagon, the apothem (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) is also \\( r \\). The relationship between the apothem \\( a \\) and the side length \\( S \\) of the hexagon is:\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{S \\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSetting \\( a = r \\) gives us:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{S \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\implies S = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( S \\) into the area formula:\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{circumscribed}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} S^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\left(\\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( S^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nS^2 = \\left(\\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4r^2}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the circumscribed hexagon becomes:\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{circumscribed}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4r^2}{3} = 2\\sqrt{3} r^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Ratio of the Areas\n\nNow, we compute the ratio \\( R \\) of the area of the larger hexagon to the area of the smaller hexagon:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{A_{\\text{circumscribed}}}{A_{\\text{inscribed}}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3} r^2}{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} r^2}\n\\]\n\nCancelling \\( r^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 2}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the final ratio of the area of the larger hexagon to the area of the smaller hexagon is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Form a triangle whose first vertex is the center of the circle and whose other two vertices are the midpoint and one of the endpoints of a side of the larger hexagon, as shown in the diagram.  Since each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees, this triangle is a 30-60-90 right triangle.  Let $r$ be the radius of the circle.  The length of the longer leg of the triangle is $r$, so the length of the shorter leg is $r/\\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $2r/\\sqrt{3}$.  Since for the smaller hexagon the length of the segment connecting a vertex to the center is $r$, the dimensions of the larger hexagon are $2/\\sqrt{3}$ times larger than the dimensions of the smaller hexagon.  Therefore, the area of the larger triangle is $(2/\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$ times greater than the area of the smaller triangle.\n\n[asy]\nsize(5cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));\nfor(i=0;i<=5;++i)\n\n{\n\ndraw(dir(60*i)--dir(60*(i+1)));\n\ndraw(2/sqrt(3)*dir(60*i)--2/sqrt(3)*dir(60*(i+1)));\n\n}\ndraw(2/sqrt(3)*dir(0)--(0,0)--dir(30));\ndraw(0.93*dir(30)--dir(30)+0.07*dir(-60)+0.07*dir(210)--dir(30)+0.07*dir(-60));[/asy]"
