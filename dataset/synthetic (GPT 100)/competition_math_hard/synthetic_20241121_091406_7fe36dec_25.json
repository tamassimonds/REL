  "problem": "A sphere is inscribed in a cube with edge length 9 inches. Then a smaller cube is inscribed in the sphere. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed cube? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of finding the volume of a cube inscribed within a sphere that is itself inscribed in a larger cube, we can break the solution down into a series of logical steps:\n\n1. **Identify Measurements:**\n   - The side length of the larger cube is 9 inches. \n   - Because the sphere is inscribed in this cube, its diameter is also 9 inches. Consequently, the radius \\( r \\) of the sphere is:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Relationship Between Smaller Cube and Sphere:**\n   - The smaller cube is inscribed within the sphere, meaning the diagonal of the smaller cube equals the diameter of the sphere, which we've established as 9 inches.\n   - Let the side length of the smaller cube be \\( s \\). The formula for the diagonal \\( d \\) of a cube in terms of its side length is:\n     \\[\n     d = s\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, we set the diagonal equal to the diameter:\n     \\[\n     s\\sqrt{3} = 9\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solving for Side Length \\( s \\):**\n   - To isolate \\( s \\), rearranging the equation gives:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}\n     \\]\n   - To rationalize the denominator, we multiply by \\( \\sqrt{3} \\):\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{3} = 3\\sqrt{3} \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Volume of the Smaller Cube:**\n   - The volume \\( V \\) of a cube is calculated using the formula \\( V = s^3 \\):\n     \\[\n     V = (3\\sqrt{3})^3\n     \\]\n   - This can be computed as:\n     \\[\n     V = 3^3 \\cdot (\\sqrt{3})^3 = 27 \\cdot 3\\sqrt{3} = 81\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cubic inches}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\nThe volume of the inscribed cube is:\n<ANSWER> 81\\sqrt{3} cubic inches </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We draw a diagram:\n\n[asy]\nsize(140);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndot((6,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nThe sphere's diameter length is equal to the big cube's side length, which is 9.\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),9));\ndraw((15,6)..(6,8)..(-3,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((15,6)..(6,4)..(-3,6));\ndot((6,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nNow the sphere's diameter is equal to the space diagonal of the small cube, meaning that the distance between two opposite corners of a cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere.  To compute the space diagonal of the cube, let the side length of the cube be $s$, and label points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ as shown below.\n\n[asy]\nsize(85);\npen dps=linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps);\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,0),SW); label(\"$C$\",(9,0),SE); label(\"$D$\",(12,3),NE); label(\"$A$\",(3,3),NW); label(\"$E$\",(12,12),E);\n[/asy] We look at triangle $\\triangle BDE$, where $\\overline{BE}$ is the space diagonal.  $\\overline{DE}$ is a side length of the cube with length $s$. $\\overline{BD}$ is the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with legs length $s$, so its length is $\\sqrt{s^2+s^2}=s\\sqrt{2}$.  So we have \\[BE=\\sqrt{DE^2+BD^2}=\\sqrt{s^2+(s\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{3s^2} = s\\sqrt{3}.\\]Thus, the space diagonal of a cube with side length $s$ has length $s\\sqrt{3}$.  The sphere has diameter 9, which is equal to the space diagonal of the cube, so we have \\[9 = s\\sqrt{3} \\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad s = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]Finally, the volume of the cube is $s^3 = \\left(\\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{81\\sqrt{3}}$."
