  "problem": "Let $X,$ $Y,$ and $Z$ be points such that $\\frac{XZ}{XY} = \\frac{ZY}{XY} = \\frac{1}{2}.$ If $Y = (1, 7)$, $Z = (-1, -7)$, then what is the sum of the coordinates of $X$?",
  "solution": "To determine the coordinates of point \\(X\\) given \\(Y = (1, 7)\\), \\(Z = (-1, -7)\\), and the ratios \\(\\frac{XZ}{XY} = \\frac{ZY}{XY} = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Interpret the Ratios**: The given ratios indicate that:\n   \\[\n   ZY = \\frac{1}{2} XY \\quad \\text{and} \\quad XZ = \\frac{1}{2} XY.\n   \\]\n   This means that both segments \\(XZ\\) and \\(ZY\\) are half the length of segment \\(XY\\), thus making point \\(Z\\) the midpoint of segment \\(XY\\).\n\n2. **Midpoint Formula**: Since \\(Z\\) is the midpoint of \\(XY\\), we can express this relationship mathematically as:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\left(\\frac{x_X + 1}{2}, \\frac{y_X + 7}{2}\\right),\n   \\]\n   where \\(X = (x_X, y_X)\\) is the unknown point we want to find.\n\n3. **Set Up Equations Using Coordinates of \\(Z\\)**: Given \\(Z = (-1, -7)\\), we can set up the following equations:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x_X + 1}{2} = -1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{y_X + 7}{2} = -7.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x_X\\)**: From the first equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x_X + 1}{2} = -1 \\implies x_X + 1 = -2 \\implies x_X = -3.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\(y_X\\)**: From the second equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{y_X + 7}{2} = -7 \\implies y_X + 7 = -14 \\implies y_X = -21.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Coordinates of \\(X\\)**: Therefore, the coordinates of point \\(X\\) are:\n   \\[\n   X = (-3, -21).\n   \\]\n\n7. **Sum of Coordinates**: Finally, we compute the sum of the coordinates of point \\(X\\):\n   \\[\n   -3 + (-21) = -24.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>-24 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "From the problem, we can see that $XZ = ZY$ and $XZ + ZY = XY$, which means that $X,$ $Y,$ and $Z$ form a degenerate triangle. In other words, $Z$ is the midpoint of $XY$. Since from Y to Z, we go 2 steps left and 14 steps down, we do the same to arrive at $X = (-1 - 2, -7 -14) = (-3, -21).$ Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of $X$ is $\\boxed{-24}.$"
