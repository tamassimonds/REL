  "problem": "Given that the polynomial $x^2-5x+t$ has only positive integer roots, find the average of all distinct possible values of $t$.",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we start with the polynomial \\(x^2 - 5x + t\\) and the requirement that it has positive integer roots.\n\nLet the roots of the polynomial be denoted by \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\). According to Vieta's formulas, we have:\n\n1. The sum of the roots:\n   \\[\n   r_1 + r_2 = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. The product of the roots:\n   \\[\n   r_1 \\cdot r_2 = t\n   \\]\n\nGiven that \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) must be positive integers, we can identify the pairs of integers that satisfy the equation \\(r_1 + r_2 = 5\\):\n\n- Possible pairs \\((r_1, r_2)\\) are:\n  - \\( (1, 4) \\)\n  - \\( (2, 3) \\)\n  - \\( (3, 2) \\)\n  - \\( (4, 1) \\)\n\nSince the roots are interchangeable, we only consider the distinct products to determine \\(t\\):\n\n- For the pair \\( (1, 4) \\):\n  \\[\n  t = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4\n  \\]\n- For the pair \\( (2, 3) \\):\n  \\[\n  t = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\n  \\]\n\nThe resulting distinct values of \\(t\\) from these pairs are \\(4\\) and \\(6\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the average of these distinct values:\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{sum of distinct values}}{\\text{number of distinct values}} = \\frac{4 + 6}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this polynomial. Since $-\\frac{b}{a}$ is the sum and $\\frac{c}{a}$ is the product of the roots of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we have $r_1+r_2=5$ and $r_1r_2=t$. Since $r_1$ and $r_2$ are positive integers, the only possible ordered pairs $(r_1,r_2)$ are $(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),$ and $(4,1)$. These produce the values of 4,6,6, and 4 respectively for $t$. Therefore, the average of the distinct possibilities, 4 and 6, is $\\boxed{5}$."
