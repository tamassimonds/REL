  "problem": "There are $20n$ members in the Trumpington marching band, and when they line up in rows of 26, there are 4 band members left over. If $n$ is an integer and there are fewer than 1000 band members, what is the maximum number of people that could be in the Trumpington marching band?",
  "solution": "To determine the maximum number of members in the Trumpington marching band, we start with the following information:\n\n1. The total number of members is expressed as \\(20n\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer.\n2. When the members line up in rows of 26, 4 members are left over, which gives us the congruence relation:\n\n\\[\n20n \\equiv 4 \\mod 26\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we can isolate \\(20n\\):\n\n\\[\n20n - 4 \\equiv 0 \\mod 26\n\\]\n\nThis tells us that \\(20n - 4\\) is divisible by 26, so we can write:\n\n\\[\n20n = 26k + 4 \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{26k + 4}{20}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{13k + 2}{10}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(n\\) to be an integer, \\(13k + 2\\) must be divisible by 10. We set up the congruence:\n\n\\[\n13k + 2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 10\n\\]\n\\[\n3k + 2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 10 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3k \\equiv 8 \\mod 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 10, which is 7. Multiplying both sides of the congruence \\(3k \\equiv 8\\) by 7 gives:\n\n\\[\nk \\equiv 56 \\mod 10 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k \\equiv 6 \\mod 10\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(k\\) can be represented as:\n\n\\[\nk = 10m + 6 \\quad \\text{for some integer } m\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(k\\) into the equation for \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\n20n = 26(10m + 6) + 4 = 260m + 156 + 4 = 260m + 160\n\\]\n\\[\nn = 13m + 8\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(n\\) back to find \\(20n\\):\n\n\\[\n20n = 20(13m + 8) = 260m + 160\n\\]\n\nTo find the maximum number of members, we need \\(20n < 1000\\):\n\n\\[\n260m + 160 < 1000\n\\]\n\\[\n260m < 840 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m < \\frac{840}{260} \\approx 3.230769\n\\]\n\nThe largest integer \\(m\\) that meets this condition is \\(m = 3\\).\n\nCalculating \\(n\\) when \\(m = 3\\):\n\n\\[\nn = 13 \\cdot 3 + 8 = 39 + 8 = 47\n\\]\n\nNow calculating the total number of members:\n\n\\[\n20n = 20 \\cdot 47 = 940\n\\]\n\nFinally, we check the modulo condition:\n\n\\[\n940 \\mod 26 = 4\n\\]\n\nThis holds true, confirming our solution. Therefore, the maximum number of members in the Trumpington marching band is:\n\n<ANSWER>940</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since there are 4 band members left over when they line up in rows of 26, we have $20n \\equiv 4\\pmod{26}$. We divide both sides of the congruence by 4, remembering that we have to divide 26 by the greatest common divisor of 4 and 26. The original congruence is equivalent to \\[\n5n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]So we would like to find a multiple of 13 which is one less than a multiple of 5. Noticing that $13\\cdot 3$ has a units digit of 9, we identify $(13\\cdot 3 + 1)/5 =8$ as the inverse of 5 (mod 13). Multiplying both sides of our congruence by 8 gives \\[\nn \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]We have found that $n$ satisfies the conditions given in the problem if $n=8+13k$ for some positive integer $k$ and $20n<1000$. Rewriting the inequality $20n<1000$ as $n<50$, we solve $8+13k < 50$ to find that the maximum solution is $k=\\lfloor 42/13\\rfloor = 3$. When $k=3$, the number of band members is $20(8+13(3))=\\boxed{940}$."
