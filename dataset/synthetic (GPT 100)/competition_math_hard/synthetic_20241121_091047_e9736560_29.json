  "problem": "An infinite geometric series has a first term of $12$ and a second term of $4.$ A second infinite geometric series has the same first term of $12,$ a second term of $4+n,$ and a sum of four times that of the first series. Find the value of $n.$",
  "solution": "To solve the problem involving two infinite geometric series, we can break the process down into clear steps:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the common ratio of the first series.\nThe first geometric series has a first term \\( a_1 = 12 \\) and a second term \\( a_2 = 4 \\). The common ratio \\( r \\) is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\na_2 = a_1 \\cdot r \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4 = 12 \\cdot r\n\\]\nSolving for \\( r \\):\n\\[\nr = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the first series.\nThe sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series is given by:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a_1}{1 - r}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( a_1 = 12 \\) and \\( r = \\frac{1}{3} \\):\n\\[\nS_1 = \\frac{12}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{12}{\\frac{2}{3}} = 12 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 18\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the second series.\nThe second series also starts with a first term \\( a_1 = 12 \\) and has a second term defined as \\( a_2 = 4 + n \\). Using the same approach, we express the common ratio \\( r_2 \\) as:\n\\[\nr_2 = \\frac{4 + n}{12}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the second series.\nBy the problem's conditions, the sum of the second series \\( S_2 \\) is four times that of the first series:\n\\[\nS_2 = 4 \\cdot S_1 = 4 \\cdot 18 = 72\n\\]\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\\[\nS_2 = \\frac{12}{1 - r_2}\n\\]\nSetting the two expressions for \\( S_2 \\) equal gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{1 - r_2} = 72\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\( r_2 \\).\nCross-multiplying leads to:\n\\[\n12 = 72(1 - r_2)\n\\]\nExpanding:\n\\[\n12 = 72 - 72r_2\n\\]\nRearranging yields:\n\\[\n72r_2 = 72 - 12 = 60 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r_2 = \\frac{60}{72} = \\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Relate \\( r_2 \\) back to \\( n \\).\nSince we have:\n\\[\nr_2 = \\frac{4 + n}{12}\n\\]\nwe can set:\n\\[\n\\frac{4 + n}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\\[\n4 + n = 10\n\\]\nThus, solving for \\( n \\) yields:\n\\[\nn = 10 - 4 = 6\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe value of \\( n \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\] \n\nThis coherent step-by-step approach clearly presents the solution to the problem.",
  "ground_truth": "Note that if the the two series have constant ratios of $a$ and $b,$ respectively, then $4\\left( \\frac{12}{1-a} \\right) = \\frac{12}{1-b}.$ Simplifying, $4(1-b)=1-a.$ Substituting in $a= \\frac{4}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}$ and $b= \\frac{4+n}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{n}{12},$ we quickly find that $n=\\boxed{6}.$"
