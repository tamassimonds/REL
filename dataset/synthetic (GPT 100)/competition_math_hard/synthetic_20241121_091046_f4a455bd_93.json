  "problem": "Four concentric circles are drawn with radii of 1, 3, 5 and 7. The inner circle is painted black, the ring around it is white, the next ring is black and the outer ring is white. What is the ratio of the black area to the white area? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of finding the ratio of the areas of the black and white regions formed by four concentric circles with radii of 1, 3, 5, and 7, we will proceed through the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Areas of the Circles\n\n1. **Radius 1:** \n   \\[\n   A_1 = \\pi (1^2) = \\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Radius 3:** \n   \\[\n   A_2 = \\pi (3^2) = 9\\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Radius 5:** \n   \\[\n   A_3 = \\pi (5^2) = 25\\pi\n   \\]\n\n4. **Radius 7:** \n   \\[\n   A_4 = \\pi (7^2) = 49\\pi\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Areas of the Rings\n\nNext, we find the areas of the regions (rings) between these circles, categorizing them as black or white:\n\n1. **Black Area (inner circle):** \n   The area of the circular region with radius 1:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Black area 1} = A_1 = \\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **White Area (ring between radii 1 and 3):** \n   The area of the ring is given by the area of the larger circle minus the area of the inner circle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{White area 1} = A_2 - A_1 = 9\\pi - \\pi = 8\\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Black Area (ring between radii 3 and 5):** \n   The area of this ring:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Black area 2} = A_3 - A_2 = 25\\pi - 9\\pi = 16\\pi\n   \\]\n\n4. **White Area (ring between radii 5 and 7):** \n   The area for this ring:\n   \\[\n   \\text{White area 2} = A_4 - A_3 = 49\\pi - 25\\pi = 24\\pi\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Areas\n\nNow we can calculate the total areas of the black and white regions:\n\n- **Total Black Area:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Black} = \\text{Black area 1} + \\text{Black area 2} = \\pi + 16\\pi = 17\\pi\n   \\]\n\n- **Total White Area:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total White} = \\text{White area 1} + \\text{White area 2} = 8\\pi + 24\\pi = 32\\pi\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Ratio\n\nFinally, we determine the ratio of the total black area to the total white area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Black Area}}{\\text{Total White Area}} = \\frac{17\\pi}{32\\pi} = \\frac{17}{32}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the ratio of the black area to the white area is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{17}{32}} \n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The areas of the four circles are $\\pi, 9\\pi, 25\\pi$ and $49\\pi$. The areas of the two black regions are $\\pi$ and $25\\pi - 9\\pi = 16\\pi$, for a total black area of $\\pi + 16\\pi = 17\\pi$. The areas of the two white regions are $9\\pi - \\pi = 8\\pi$ and $49\\pi - 25\\pi = 24\\pi$, for a total white area of $8\\pi + 24\\pi = 32\\pi$. The ratio of the black area to the white area is $17\\pi/32\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{17}{32}}.$"
