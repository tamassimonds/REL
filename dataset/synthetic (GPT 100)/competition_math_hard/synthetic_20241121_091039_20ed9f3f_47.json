  "problem": "A merchant offers a large group of items at $30\\%$ off.  Later, the merchant takes $20\\%$ off these sale prices and claims that the final price of these items is $50\\%$ off the original price.  As a percentage of the original price, what is the difference between the true discount and the merchant's claimed discount? (Your answer should be a positive difference.)",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we will systematically analyze the discounts applied by the merchant.\n\n1. **Identify the Original Price**:  \n   Let the original price of the items be \\( P \\).\n\n2. **First Discount (30% off)**:  \n   The merchant offers a 30% discount on the original price, resulting in a sale price of:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{First Sale Price} = P - 0.30P = 0.70P\n   \\]\n\n3. **Second Discount (20% off the sale price)**:  \n   A 20% discount is then applied to the first sale price. We calculate the final sale price as follows:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Sale Price} = 0.70P - 0.20 \\times 0.70P = 0.70P - 0.14P = 0.56P\n   \\]\n\n4. **Claimed Discount**:  \n   The merchant claims that the final price is equal to a 50% discount off the original price, which would be:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Claimed Price} = P - 0.50P = 0.50P\n   \\]\n\n5. **True Discount Calculation**:  \n   The actual discount from the original price to the final sale price is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{True Discount} = P - 0.56P = 0.44P  \n   \\]  \n   This indicates a true discount of 44% off the original price.\n\n6. **Claimed Discount Calculation**:  \n   The claimed discount is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Claimed Discount} = P - 0.50P = 0.50P  \n   \\]  \n   This means the claimed discount is 50% off the original price.\n\n7. **Calculate the Difference**:  \n   We compare the true discount of 44% with the claimed discount of 50%:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 50\\% - 44\\% = 6\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between the true discount and the claimed discount, expressed as a percentage of the original price, is:\n\n<ANSWER>6</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The first discount means that the customer will pay $70\\%$ of the original price.  The second discount means a selling price of $80\\%$ of  the discounted price.  Because $0.80(0.70) = 0.56 = 56\\% $, the customer pays $56\\%$ of the original price and thus receives a $44\\%$ discount, for a difference of $50\\% - 44\\% = \\boxed{6\\%}$."
