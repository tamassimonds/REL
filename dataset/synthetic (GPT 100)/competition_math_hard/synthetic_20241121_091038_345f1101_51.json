  "problem": "A rectangular array of chairs is an arrangement of the chairs in rows and columns such that each row contains the same number of chairs as every other row and each column contains the same number of chairs as every other column.  If there must be at least two chairs in every row and column and all of the chairs in the room must be included, how many arrays are possible in a classroom containing $36$ chairs? Note that $12$ rows of $3$ chairs is different from $3$ rows of $12$ chairs.",
  "solution": "To determine the number of distinct rectangular arrays that can be created with 36 chairs, ensuring at least 2 chairs are present in each row and column, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Factors of 36**:\n   First, we identify the factors of 36. These factors represent potential rows and columns for the chair arrangement:\n   \\[\n   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Select Valid Factor Pairs**:\n   We need to examine each pair of these factors \\( (r, c) \\), where \\( r \\) denotes the number of rows and \\( c \\) denotes the number of columns. The conditions to meet are \\( r \\times c = 36 \\), with both \\( r \\geq 2 \\) and \\( c \\geq 2 \\). From our factor list, the valid pairs that meet these criteria are:\n   - \\( (2, 18) \\)\n   - \\( (3, 12) \\)\n   - \\( (4, 9) \\)\n   - \\( (6, 6) \\)\n   - \\( (9, 4) \\)\n   - \\( (12, 3) \\)\n   - \\( (18, 2) \\)\n\n3. **Count Unique Arrangements**:\n   Each pair represents a unique arrangement due to the distinct specification of rows and columns. For instance, \\( (2, 18) \\) is different from \\( (18, 2) \\). Therefore, we must count each arrangement separately.\n\nAfter listing out all the valid configurations, we find there are a total of 7 unique rectangular arrays of chairs that can be created under the provided conditions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total arrays} = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>7</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We are counting the number of ways 36 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers such that one of the numbers is not 1. Factoring 36, we find that $36=2^2\\cdot3^2$. The possible values for the number of rows is 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 (notice that we cannot have 1 row). Each value corresponds to a unique arrangement of the chairs. Thus, there are $\\boxed{7}$ possible arrays."
