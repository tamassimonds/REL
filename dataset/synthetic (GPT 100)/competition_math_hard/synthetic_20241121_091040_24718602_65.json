  "problem": "John has 12 marbles of different colors, including one red, one green, and one blue marble. In how many ways can he choose 4 marbles, if exactly one of the chosen marbles is red, green, or blue?",
  "solution": "To determine how many ways John can choose 4 marbles from his collection of 12 marbles (which includes one marble each of red, green, and blue) such that exactly one of the chosen marbles is colored red, green, or blue, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Select the Colored Marble\n\nSince we require exactly one colored marble, we begin by selecting which one it will be. The options are:\n\n- Red\n- Green\n- Blue\n\nThis gives us **3 choices** for the colored marble.\n\n### Step 2: Select the Remaining Marbles\n\nAfter choosing a colored marble, we need to choose 3 additional marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (the original 12 marbles minus the one colored marble selected).\n\nThe remaining marbles consist of 9 that are not red, green, or blue.\n\nTo find out how many ways we can select 3 marbles from these 9, we use the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(n\\) is the total number of items (9), and \\(r\\) is the number of items we want to choose (3). Thus, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9!}{3!6!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 84\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Choices\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to select the colored marble by the number of ways to select the remaining marbles:\n\n- **3 ways** to choose the colored marble.\n- **84 ways** to choose the additional 3 marbles.\n\nTherefore, the total number of combinations is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = 3 \\times 84 = 252\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>252 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "There are 3 ways for John to decide which of the red, green, and blue marbles to choose. After he has chosen one of them, he must choose 3 marbles from the other 9. There are $\\binom{9}{3}=84$ ways for him to do this. The total number of valid ways for John to choose four marbles is $3\\cdot 84=\\boxed{252}$."
