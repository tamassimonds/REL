  "problem": "Alexio has 100 cards numbered 1-100, inclusive, and places them in a box. Alexio then chooses a card from the box at random. What is the probability that the number on the card he chooses is a multiple of 2, 3 or 5? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To determine the probability that Alexio draws a card numbered with a multiple of 2, 3, or 5 from a box containing cards numbered 1 to 100, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Total Outcomes\nThe total number of cards is:\n\\[\nN = 100.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Count Favorable Outcomes\nWe will identify how many cards are multiples of 2, 3, or 5 using the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\n1. **Multiples of 2**:\n   The multiples of 2 from 1 to 100 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. This forms an arithmetic sequence with:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{100 - 2}{2} + 1 = 50.\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( |A| = 50 \\).\n\n2. **Multiples of 3**:\n   The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, ..., 99. The count is:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{99 - 3}{3} + 1 = 33.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( |B| = 33 \\).\n\n3. **Multiples of 5**:\n   The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, ..., 100:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{100 - 5}{5} + 1 = 20.\n   \\]\n   So, \\( |C| = 20 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Account for Overlaps\nNext, we calculate overlaps where numbers are counted more than once:\n\n- **Multiples of 6 (2 and 3)**:\n  The count is:\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{96 - 6}{6} + 1 = 16.\n  \\]\n  Thus, \\( |A \\cap B| = 16 \\).\n\n- **Multiples of 10 (2 and 5)**:\n  The count is:\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{100 - 10}{10} + 1 = 10.\n  \\]\n  So, \\( |A \\cap C| = 10 \\).\n\n- **Multiples of 15 (3 and 5)**:\n  The count is:\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{90 - 15}{15} + 1 = 6.\n  \\]\n  Therefore, \\( |B \\cap C| = 6 \\).\n\n- **Multiples of 30 (2, 3, and 5)**:\n  The count is:\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{90 - 30}{30} + 1 = 3.\n  \\]\n  Hence, \\( |A \\cap B \\cap C| = 3 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Inclusion-Exclusion Formula\nWe now apply the Inclusion-Exclusion principle to find the total count of favorable outcomes:\n\\[\n|A \\cup B \\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap C| - |B \\cap C| + |A \\cap B \\cap C|.\n\\]\nSubstituting in the values gives:\n\\[\n|A \\cup B \\cup C| = 50 + 33 + 20 - 16 - 10 - 6 + 3 = 74.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Probability\nThe probability \\( P \\) that Alexio draws a card that is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5 is:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{|A \\cup B \\cup C|}{N} = \\frac{74}{100} = \\frac{37}{50}.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nHence, the final probability that Alexio draws a card numbered with a multiple of 2, 3, or 5 is:\n\\[\n\\frac{37}{50}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There are 50 numbers between 1-100 inclusive which are divisible by 2 --- all the even numbers. To avoid overcounting, we must find all the odd multiples of 3. Beginning with 3, the sequence of all such numbers is $3, 9, 15\\cdots99$, which gives $\\dfrac{99-3}{6}+1=17$ such numbers.\n\nFinally, we must find all odd multiples of 5 which are not divisible by 3. These are 5, 25, 35, 55, 65, 85, and 95. This gives a final count of $50+17+7=74$ numbers between 1-100 inclusive which are multiples of 2, 3, or 5.\n\nThe probability that Alexio selects one of these is therefore $\\boxed{\\dfrac{37}{50}}$."
