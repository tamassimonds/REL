  "problem": "The graph of the parabola defined by the equation $y=(x-2)^2+3$ is rotated 180 degrees about its vertex, then shifted 3 units to the left, then shifted 2 units down. The resulting parabola has zeros at $x=a$ and $x=b$. What is $a+b$?",
  "solution": "Here's a more coherent and concise summary of the solution:\n\nTo solve the problem involving the given parabola \\(y = (x - 2)^2 + 3\\), we will perform a series of transformations systematically.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Vertex\nThe given equation is in vertex form \\(y = a(x - h)^2 + k\\), where the vertex \\((h, k)\\) can be identified as:\n- \\(h = 2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\)\n\nTherefore, the vertex of the parabola is \\((2, 3)\\).\n\n### Step 2: Rotate the Parabola 180 Degrees\nRotating the parabola 180 degrees around its vertex changes its orientation from upward to downward, resulting in the new equation:\n\\[\ny = -((x - 2)^2) + 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Shift the Parabola 3 Units to the Left\nNext, we shift the equation 3 units to the left by replacing \\(x\\) with \\(x + 3\\):\n\\[\ny = -((x + 3 - 2)^2) + 3 = -((x + 1)^2) + 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Equation\nUpon simplification, the equation becomes:\n\\[\ny = -(x + 1)^2 + 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Shift the Parabola 2 Units Down\nTo shift the parabola down by 2 units, we adjust the equation:\n\\[\ny = -(x + 1)^2 + 3 - 2 = -(x + 1)^2 + 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Final Equation\nThe final equation of the transformed parabola is:\n\\[\ny = -(x + 1)^2 + 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Find the Zeros of the New Parabola\nTo find the zeros, we set \\(y = 0\\):\n\\[\n0 = -(x + 1)^2 + 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (x + 1)^2 = 1\n\\]\nFrom this, we derive two cases:\n1. \\(x + 1 = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 0\\)\n2. \\(x + 1 = -1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -2\\)\n\nThus, the zeros are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = -2\\).\n\n### Step 8: Calculate \\(a + b\\)\nLet \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = -2\\). Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\na + b = 0 + (-2) = -2\n\\]\n\nFinally, we conclude that the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The graph of the original parabola ($A$) and its final image ($A'$) after rotation and translation is shown below:\n\n[asy]\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(-3,4,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nyaxis(-3,7,Ticks(f, 2.0));\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn (x-2)^2+3;\n\n}\n\ndraw(\"$A$\", graph(f,0,4), linewidth(1));\nreal g(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn -(x+1)^2+1;\n\n}\n\ndraw(\"$A'$\", graph(g,-3,1), linewidth(1));\n[/asy]\n\nRotating the original parabola 180 degrees changes its equation to $y=-(x-2)^2+3$. Shifting this last parabola to the left changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+3$. Shifting it down changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+1$. So the equation of $A'$ is $y=-(x+1)^2+1$. To find the zeros of this parabola, we set $y=0$ to get $0=-(x+1)^2+1$. Expanding the right hand side gives $0=-x^2-2x$. Dividing through by $-1$ and factoring out an $x$ from the right hand side, we get $0=x(x+2)$, so either $x=0$ or $x+2=0$. Thus, $a=0$ and $b=-2$, so $a+b=\\boxed{-2}$."
