  "problem": "A trapezoid has one base equal to twice its height, $x$, and the other base is three times as long as the height. Write the expression for the area of the trapezoid as a common fraction in terms of the height $x$.",
  "solution": "To find the area of the trapezoid given certain conditions, follow these systematic steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Dimensions:**\n   - The height of the trapezoid is denoted as \\( x \\).\n   - The first base is twice the height: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Base}_1 = 2x\n     \\]\n   - The second base is three times the height:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Base}_2 = 3x\n     \\]\n\n2. **Use the Area Formula:**\n   The area \\( A \\) of a trapezoid can be calculated with the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (b_1 + b_2) \\times h\n   \\]\n   where \\( b_1 \\) and \\( b_2 \\) are the lengths of the two bases, and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n3. **Substitute Known Values:**\n   Plugging in \\( b_1 = 2x \\), \\( b_2 = 3x \\), and \\( h = x \\) into the area formula, we get:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2x + 3x) \\times x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   Combine the lengths of the bases:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5x \\times x\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Area:**\n   Continuing from the previous step, we simplify further:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5x^2\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Calculation:**\n   Thus, we find the area as:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{5}{2} x^2\n   \\]\n\n7. **Present the Final Answer:**\n   The area of the trapezoid, expressed as a common fraction in terms of the height \\( x \\), is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\frac{5}{2} x^2}\n   \\] \n\nIn summary, the area of the trapezoid is \\(\\frac{5}{2} x^2\\).",
  "ground_truth": "The area of a trapezoid is equal to the product of the height and the average of the lengths of the bases. In this case, since the length of the two bases are $2x$ and $3x$ and the length of the height is $x$, the area is equal to $\\frac{2x+3x}{2} \\cdot x=\\frac{5x}{2}\\cdot x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5x^2}{2}}$."
