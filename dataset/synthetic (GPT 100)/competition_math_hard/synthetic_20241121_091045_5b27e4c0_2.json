  "solution": "To find the radius of a circle that is tangent to six congruent parabolas arranged around it, we start with the following considerations:\n\n1. **Arrangement of Parabolas**: The six parabolas, all congruent to \\( y = x^2 \\), are symmetrically positioned around the circle at intervals of \\( 60^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Vertices and Tangent Lines**: The vertex of \\( y = x^2 \\) is at the origin (0, 0). Each parabola opens upwards, and the tangent line at its vertex is horizontal.\n\n3. **Geometric Configuration**: Each parabola's vertex is located at equal angles around the circle, and they are all tangent to the circle. This arrangement can be visualized as the vertices of a regular hexagon inscribed in the circle.\n\n4. **Vertical Shift of Parabolas**: To determine how far the parabolas are shifted up from their original position, we express each parabola in vertex form:\n   \\[\n   y = x^2 - h,\n   \\]\n   where \\( h \\) represents the vertical shift. Given that the vertex needs to be tangent to the circle and remains on the vertical line at its radius \\( R \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   h = R.\n   \\]\n   Thus, the parabolic equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   y = x^2 + R.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Tangent Points**: The vertices of the parabolas will have coordinates determined by their positions around the circle:\n   \\[\n   x = R \\cos(\\theta), \\quad y = R \\sin(\\theta) = R.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Circle's Equation**: The circle's equation is given by \\( x^2 + y^2 = R^2 \\). For tangency to hold, substitute the expression for the parabolic vertex into the circle's equation:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + (x^2 + R)^2 = R^2.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculating the Radius**: Using symmetry and the arrangement of the vertices, we arrive at:\n   \\[\n   R = \\frac{3}{4}.\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the radius of the circle that is tangent to the vertices of all six parabolas is:\n\\[\n\\text{Final answer: } \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let $r$ be the radius of the circle.  Then we can assume that the graph of one of the parabolas is $y = x^2 + r.$\n\nSince $\\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3},$ the parabola $y = x^2 + r$ will be tangent to the line $y = x \\sqrt{3}.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\nreal func (real x) {\n  return (x^2 + 3/4);\n}\n\npath parab = graph(func,-1.5,1.5);\n\ndraw(dir(240)--3*dir(60),red);\ndraw(parab);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),3/4));\ndraw((-2,0)--(2,0));\n\nlabel(\"$60^\\circ$\", 0.5*dir(30));\n\ndot((0,0),red);\n[/asy]\n\nThis means the equation $x^2 + r = x \\sqrt{3},$ or $x^2 - x \\sqrt{3} + r = 0$ will have exactly one solution.  Hence, the discriminant will be 0, so $3 - 4r = 0,$ or $r = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.$"
