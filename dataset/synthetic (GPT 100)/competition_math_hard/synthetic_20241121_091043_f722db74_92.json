  "problem": "Two arithmetic sequences $A$ and $B$ both begin with 30 and have common differences of absolute value 10, with sequence $A$ increasing and sequence $B$ decreasing. What is the absolute value of the difference between the 51st term of sequence $A$ and the 51st term of sequence $B$?",
  "solution": "To solve for the absolute value of the difference between the 51st terms of two arithmetic sequences, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which both start at 30 with a common difference of absolute value 10, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Define the sequences\n\n- **Sequence \\(A\\):** An increasing sequence with:\n  - First term \\(a_1 = 30\\)\n  - Common difference \\(d_A = 10\\)\n\n- **Sequence \\(B\\):** A decreasing sequence with:\n  - First term \\(b_1 = 30\\)\n  - Common difference \\(d_B = -10\\)\n\n### Step 2: Apply the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence\n\nThe formula for the \\(n\\)-th term (\\(T_n\\)) is:\n\n\\[\nT_n = T_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T_1\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n### Step 3: Find the 51st term of sequence \\(A\\)\n\nUsing the formula for sequence \\(A\\):\n\n\\[\nT_{51}^A = 30 + (51 - 1) \\cdot 10 = 30 + 50 \\cdot 10 = 30 + 500 = 530\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the 51st term of sequence \\(B\\)\n\nUsing the formula for sequence \\(B\\):\n\n\\[\nT_{51}^B = 30 + (51 - 1) \\cdot (-10) = 30 + 50 \\cdot (-10) = 30 - 500 = -470\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the absolute value of the difference between the two terms\n\nTo find the absolute difference between \\(T_{51}^A\\) and \\(T_{51}^B\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = T_{51}^A - T_{51}^B = 530 - (-470) = 530 + 470 = 1000\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Finalize the absolute value\n\nThe absolute value of the difference is:\n\n\\[\n|T_{51}^A - T_{51}^B| = |1000| = 1000\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe absolute value of the difference between the 51st terms of sequences \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence whose first term is $a_1$ and whose common difference is $d$ is $a_n=a_1+d(n-1)$.  Therefore, the $n$th term of $A$ is $30+10(n-1)$, and the $n$th term of $B$ is $30-10(n-1)$.  Therefore, the positive difference between the $n$th term of $A$ and the $n$th term of $B$ is $30+10(n-1)-[30-10(n-1)]=20(n-1)$.  Substituting $n=51$, we find that the positive difference between the 51st terms of $A$ and $B$ is $\\boxed{1000}$."
