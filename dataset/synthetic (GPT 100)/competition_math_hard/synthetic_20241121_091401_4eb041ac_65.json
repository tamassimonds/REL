  "problem": "Points $A(3,5)$ and $B(7,10)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of a circle graphed in a coordinate plane. How many square units are in the area of the circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
  "solution": "To find the area of the circle defined by endpoints \\(A(3,5)\\) and \\(B(7,10)\\) as the diameter, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Length of the Diameter\nWe will use the distance formula, which states that the distance \\(d\\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the coordinates of points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n\n- \\(x_1 = 3\\), \\(y_1 = 5\\)\n- \\(x_2 = 7\\), \\(y_2 = 10\\)\n\nwe calculate:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(7 - 3)^2 + (10 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{(4)^2 + (5)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 25} = \\sqrt{41}\n\\]\n\nThus, the diameter \\(AB\\) measures \\( \\sqrt{41} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Find the Radius\nThe radius \\(r\\) of the circle is half the length of the diameter:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Circle\nThe area \\(A\\) of a circle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in the radius we found:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi \\cdot \\frac{41}{4} = \\frac{41\\pi}{4}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe area of the circle is \n\n\\[\n\\frac{41\\pi}{4} \\text{ square units.}\n\\]\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\frac{41\\pi}{4}}\\)",
  "ground_truth": "We must find the radius of the circle in order to find the area. We are told that points $A$ and $B$ are the endpoints of a diameter, so we can find the distance between these two points. We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(7-3)^2 + (10-5)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 25} = \\sqrt{41}$.\n\nSince the diameter has a length of $\\sqrt{41}$, the radius must have length $\\sqrt{41}/2$. Therefore, the answer is $(\\sqrt{41}/2)^2\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{41\\pi}{4}}$."
