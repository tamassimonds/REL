  "problem": "Angela has deposited $\\$8,\\!000$ into an account that pays $6\\%$ interest compounded annually.\n\nBob has deposited $\\$10,\\!000$ into an account that pays $7\\%$ simple annual interest.\n\nIn $20$ years Angela and Bob compare their respective balances. To the nearest dollar, what is the positive difference between their balances?",
  "solution": "To find the positive difference between Angela's and Bob's account balances after 20 years, we'll first calculate each balance separately.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Angela's Total Balance\n\nAngela's account uses compound interest, calculated with the formula:\n\n\\[\nA = P(1 + r)^n\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\(P = 8000\\) (initial deposit)\n- \\(r = 0.06\\) (annual interest rate, 6%)\n- \\(n = 20\\) (years)\n\nSubstituting in the values:\n\n\\[\nA = 8000(1 + 0.06)^{20}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(1 + 0.06 = 1.06\\), we find:\n\n\\[\n1.06^{20} \\approx 3.207135472\n\\]\n\nNow we multiply this by the principal:\n\n\\[\nA \\approx 8000 \\times 3.207135472 \\approx 25657.08\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar gives:\n\n\\[\nA \\approx 25657\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Bob's Total Balance\n\nBob's account earns simple interest, calculated with the formula:\n\n\\[\nA = P(1 + rt)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(P = 10000\\) (initial deposit)\n- \\(r = 0.07\\) (annual interest rate, 7%)\n- \\(t = 20\\) (years)\n\nSubstituting in the values:\n\n\\[\nA = 10000(1 + 0.07 \\cdot 20)\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(0.07 \\cdot 20 = 1.4\\) results in:\n\n\\[\n1 + 1.4 = 2.4\n\\]\n\nNow we compute:\n\n\\[\nA = 10000 \\times 2.4 = 24000\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Positive Difference Between Their Balances\n\nNext, we find the positive difference between their balances:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = |25657 - 24000| = 1657\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between Angela's and Bob's balances after 20 years is:\n\n**$1657**",
  "ground_truth": "We may find Angela's balance by simply finding $\\$8,\\!000(1 + 0.06)^{20} \\approx \\$25,\\!657.08.$\n\nWe may find Bob's balance by finding $\\$10,\\!000(1 + 20 \\cdot 0.07) \\approx \\$24,\\!000.$\n\nTherefore, the difference between their balances is roughly $\\$25,\\!657.08 - \\$24,\\!000 \\approx \\boxed{\\$1,\\!657}.$"
