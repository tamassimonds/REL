    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: **Find the remainder of \\(2^8\\) when it is divided by 5.**\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, my brain starts jumping between different strategies. Here\u2019s what comes to mind:\n\n1. **Direct Calculation:** Just compute \\(2^8\\) and then divide by 5 to find the remainder.\n   \n2. **Modular Arithmetic:** Use properties of modulo operations to simplify the calculation.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition:** Look for patterns in the powers of 2 modulo 5 to see if there's a repeating cycle.\n\n4. **Fermat's Little Theorem:** Since 5 is prime, maybe I can apply Fermat\u2019s theorem to simplify the exponent.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which method will be the most efficient, so I\u2019ll explore each one, starting with the most straightforward: direct calculation. If that seems too cumbersome, I'll switch approaches. Let\u2019s see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Trying Direct Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet me just compute \\(2^8\\) directly and then determine what it is modulo 5. This seems like the most straightforward approach, but I wonder if calculating \\(2^8\\) outright is necessary.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n2^8 = 256\n\\]\n\nNow, divide 256 by 5 to find the remainder:\n\n\\[\n256 \\div 5 = 51 \\text{ with a remainder of } 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nOkay, so \\(256 \\mod 5 = 1\\). That seems to work. But wait, let me think about this\u2014doing \\(2^8\\) directly feels a bit heavy. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, calculating \\(2^8\\) gives me 256, which is correct, but it seems like overkill. There might be a more efficient method, especially since exponents can grow large quickly. Perhaps I should consider using modular arithmetic or recognizing patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Modular Arithmetic**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nInstead of calculating \\(2^8\\) directly, maybe I can find a pattern by evaluating smaller powers of 2 modulo 5. This might reveal a cycle that could make the calculation easier.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's compute the first few powers of 2 modulo 5:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2^1 & \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\\\\n2^2 & \\equiv 4 \\mod 5 \\\\\n2^3 & \\equiv 8 \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\\\\n2^4 & \\equiv 16 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Observation:**  \nWait a minute\u2014\\(2^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\)! That\u2019s interesting because it means every fourth power of 2 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\n**Pattern Insight:**  \nThis suggests a repeating cycle:\n\n\\[\n2^1 \\equiv 2, \\quad 2^2 \\equiv 4, \\quad 2^3 \\equiv 3, \\quad 2^4 \\equiv 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the powers of 2 modulo 5 repeat every 4 steps.\n\n**Check:**  \nI can verify this by continuing the pattern:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2^5 & \\equiv 2 \\times 1 \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\\\\n2^6 & \\equiv 2 \\times 2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 5 \\\\\n2^7 & \\equiv 2 \\times 4 \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\\\\n2^8 & \\equiv 2 \\times 3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Final Result Using Pattern:**  \nSo, \\(2^8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\), which matches our direct calculation.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis method is much simpler and avoids dealing with large numbers like 256. Recognizing the cycle makes it easy to find remainders for higher powers.\n\n**Mistake Check:**  \nWait, does this work every time? Let me think. Since \\(2^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\), then \\(2^{4k} \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\) for any integer \\(k\\). Since 8 is a multiple of 4, it makes sense that \\(2^8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\). This checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with Fermat's Little Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince 5 is a prime number, I could also apply Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if \\(p\\) is prime and \\(a\\) is not divisible by \\(p\\), then \\(a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p\\).\n\n**Application:**\n\nHere, \\(a = 2\\) and \\(p = 5\\), so according to Fermat's theorem:\n\n\\[\n2^{5-1} = 2^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis directly tells me that \\(2^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\), and since \\(2^8 = (2^4)^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\).\n\n**Check:**  \nSo, \\(2^8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\). This aligns with our earlier findings using the pattern method.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nFermat's Little Theorem provides a quick way to verify the result without having to compute large exponents directly. It confirms that our earlier approaches are correct.\n\n**Mistake Check:**  \nDoes this always apply? Yes, as long as 5 is prime and 2 is not divisible by 5, Fermat's theorem holds. So, it's a valid check.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification and Consistency Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I've explored multiple methods\u2014direct calculation, recognizing patterns, and applying Fermat's Little Theorem\u2014it's important to ensure that all approaches agree. This adds confidence to the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Direct Calculation:** \\(2^8 = 256\\), and \\(256 \\mod 5 = 1\\).\n- **Pattern Method:** From the cycle, \\(2^8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\).\n- **Fermat's Theorem:** \\(2^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\), so \\(2^8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll methods consistently yield the same remainder: **1**. This assures me that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nGoing through different strategies helped confirm the result. Initially, the direct calculation seemed straightforward, but recognizing patterns and applying Fermat's theorem provided more efficient and elegant solutions. It's always good to cross-verify using multiple approaches, especially when dealing with modular arithmetic.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe remainder of \\(2^8\\) when divided by 5 is **1**.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration mimics a human thought process, complete with brainstorming, strategy exploration, reflection, and continuous checking to ensure accuracy.
