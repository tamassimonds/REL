    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it step by step, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking along the way to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at the equation:\n\n\\[x^3 - 10x^2 + 55x - c = 0\\]\n\nand I see that **two of the roots have a product of 30**, my initial reaction is to think about the relationships between the roots of a polynomial and its coefficients. This reminds me of Vieta's formulas, which relate the roots of a polynomial to its coefficients.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. I recall that Vieta's formulas involve the sum and product of the roots, but it's been a while since I've applied them. Maybe I should write down what I remember to see if it'll help.\n\n#### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use Vieta's Formulas:**  \n   - Maybe I can use the relationships between the roots and the coefficients to set up equations involving the known product of the roots.\n\n2. **Assign Variables to Roots:**  \n   - Perhaps assigning variables to the roots and using their product and the coefficients to create equations could work.\n\n3. **Factor the Polynomial:**  \n   - Another idea is to try factoring the polynomial if possible, but that might be tricky without knowing all the roots.\n\n4. **Consider Complex Roots:**  \n   - Since it's a cubic equation, there could be three roots, and one might be complex if the polynomial doesn't factor nicely.\n\nHonestly, **Vieta's Formulas** seem like a good starting point since they directly relate the roots to the coefficients. But before committing, I should reflect: **Does this make sense? Can I apply it here?**\n\n### **Step 1: Recap on Vieta's Formulas**\n\nVieta's formulas state that for a cubic equation:\n\n\\[x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\]\n\n- The sum of the roots (\\(r_1 + r_2 + r_3\\)) is \\(-a\\).\n- The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time (\\(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3\\)) is \\(b\\).\n- The product of the roots (\\(r_1r_2r_3\\)) is \\(-c\\).\n\nWait, in our equation:\n\n\\[x^3 - 10x^2 + 55x - c = 0\\]\n\nthe coefficients are:\n\n- \\(a = -10\\)\n- \\(b = 55\\)\n- \\(c = -c\\)\n\nHmm, so according to Vieta\u2019s:\n\n- The sum of the roots \\(r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 10\\) (since \\(-(-10) = 10\\))\n- The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time \\(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 55\\)\n- The product of the roots \\(r_1r_2r_3 = c\\)\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\nThis seems promising because I can relate the roots and their products to the coefficients. But I wonder if I can set up a system of equations to solve for \\(c\\) using the given product of two roots.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign Variables to Roots**\n\nLet's assume:\n\n- \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), and \\(r_3\\) are the roots\n- Given: \\(r_1r_2 = 30\\) (the product of two roots)\n\nNow, according to Vieta's:\n\n1. \\(r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 10\\)\n2. \\(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 55\\)\n3. \\(r_1r_2r_3 = c\\)\n\nWait a moment. I have \\(r_1r_2 = 30\\), so I can use this to simplify the equations. Let me see how.\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe I can express \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) in terms of \\(r_3\\) and use that to find \\(c\\). But red flag: I need another equation involving \\(r_1\\) or \\(r_2\\) to proceed.\n\n### **Step 3: Express \\(r_1r_2\\) in Terms of Other Roots**\n\nSince \\(r_1r_2 = 30\\), and I know \\(r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 10\\), I can attempt to express \\(r_1 + r_2\\) in terms of \\(r_3\\):\n\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 = 10 - r_3\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't immediately help with finding \\(c\\). I need to find another way.\n\n#### **Realization:**\n\nMaybe I can use the second equation involving the sum of the products of the roots. Let me see:\n\n\\[\nr_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 55\n\\]\n\nSince \\(r_1r_2 = 30\\), substitute that into the equation:\n\n\\[\n30 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 55\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nr_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 25\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\nOkay, now I have an equation involving \\(r_1r_3\\) and \\(r_2r_3\\). This seems to be getting somewhere. But I still need another relationship to solve for \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), and \\(r_3\\) individually.\n\n### **Step 4: Use the Product of the Roots**\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[\nr_1r_2r_3 = c\n\\]\n\nBut right now, I don't have \\(r_3\\) or \\(r_1r_3\\) and \\(r_2r_3\\) separately. Perhaps I can find another equation involving \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), and \\(r_3\\).\n\n#### **Wait, I Might Be Overcomplicating It:**\n\nLooking back, maybe I don't need to find \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), and \\(r_3\\) individually. Perhaps I can express everything in terms of \\(r_3\\) and then find \\(c\\).\n\n### **Step 5: Express \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) in Terms of \\(r_3\\)**\n\nFrom earlier, I have:\n\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 = 10 - r_3\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nr_1r_2 = 30\n\\]\n\nHmm, this reminds me of solving a quadratic equation. Maybe I can set up a quadratic equation whose roots are \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\).\n\n#### **Step 6: Set Up the Quadratic Equation**\n\nThe sum and product of \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) can be used to construct the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - (sum \\, of \\, roots)x + (product \\, of \\, roots) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nx^2 - (10 - r_3)x + 30 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis quadratic equation has roots \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\).\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\nThis looks promising because now I can relate \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) to \\(r_3\\). But how can I connect this back to \\(c\\)?\n\n### **Step 7: Use the Second Vieta's Equation**\n\nRecall:\n\n\\[\nr_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 55\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(r_1r_2 = 30\\):\n\n\\[\n30 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 55\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nr_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 25\n\\]\n\nWait, I can factor this:\n\n\\[\nr_3(r_1 + r_2) = 25\n\\]\n\nBut I know \\(r_1 + r_2 = 10 - r_3\\), so:\n\n\\[\nr_3(10 - r_3) = 25\n\\]\n\nHmm, this looks like a quadratic equation in terms of \\(r_3\\). Let me write it down.\n\n#### **Step 8: Expand and Rearrange**\n\n\\[\nr_3(10 - r_3) = 25\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n10r_3 - r_3^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\nr_3^2 - 10r_3 + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\nWait, this quadratic equation seems familiar. Let me see if it can be factored:\n\n\\[\nr_3^2 - 10r_3 + 25 = (r_3 - 5)^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, the only solution is:\n\n\\[\nr_3 = 5\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's interesting. If \\(r_3 = 5\\), then I can find \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\).\n\n### **Step 9: Find \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\)**\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 = 10 - r_3 = 10 - 5 = 5\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nr_1r_2 = 30\n\\]\n\nSo, I have:\n\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 = 5\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1r_2 = 30\n\\]\n\nWait, this doesn't seem right because for real numbers, the product can't be larger than the square of the sum divided by four. Let's check this.\n\n#### **Reality Check:**\n\nIf \\(r_1 + r_2 = 5\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 = 6.25\n\\]\n\nBut \\(r_1r_2 = 30\\), which is greater than 6.25. This suggests that \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) must be complex conjugates.\n\n#### **Moment of Confusion:**\n\nHmm, this means that \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) are not real numbers. Let me think about that. If the roots are complex, maybe the polynomial has no real roots other than \\(r_3\\).\n\n### **Step 10: Accepting Complex Roots**\n\nOkay, so it's possible that \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) are complex roots. This sometimes happens in cubic equations with real coefficients when the product of two roots is larger than the square of their sum.\n\n#### **Insight:**\n\nI can proceed knowing that \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) are complex but their product is given as 30.\n\n### **Step 11: Finding \\(c\\)**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\nr_1r_2r_3 = c\n\\]\n\nWe already found:\n\n\\[\nr_3 = 5\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nr_1r_2 = 30\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nr_1r_2r_3 = 30 \\times 5 = 150\n\\]\n\nBut wait, I have \\(r_1r_2 = 30\\), so:\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 5 = 150\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(c = 150\\).\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\nThis seems correct because all the relationships hold:\n\n- \\(r_1 + r_2 = 5\\)\n- \\(r_1r_2 = 30\\)\n- \\(r_3 = 5\\)\n- \\(r_1r_2r_3 = 150\\)\n\n### **Step 12: Verifying with the Original Equation**\n\nLet me double-check if these values satisfy the original equation.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[x^3 - 10x^2 + 55x - c = 0\\]\n\nwith \\(c = 150\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[x^3 - 10x^2 + 55x - 150 = 0\\]\n\n#### **Check:**\n\n1. The sum of the roots should be 10:\n\n   \\[\n   r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 5 + 5 + r_3 = 10\n   \\]\n\n   That checks out.\n\n2. The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time should be 55:\n\n   \\[\n   r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 30 + 25 + 25 = 80\n   \\]\n\n   Wait, this doesn't match. The expected sum is 55, but my calculation gives 80. Hmm, this indicates a problem.\n\n#### **Identifying the Issue:**\n\nThere seems to be a mistake. Let's revisit the calculations.\n\n### **Step 13: Re-examine the Equations**\n\nFrom earlier steps, I have:\n\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 = 5\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1r_2 = 30\n\\]\n\\[\nr_3 = 5\n\\]\n\nBut, in the second Vieta\u2019s equation:\n\n\\[\nr_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 55\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n30 + 5r_1 + 5r_2 = 55\n\\]\n\nBut \\(r_1 + r_2 = 5\\), so:\n\n\\[\n30 + 5 \\times 5 = 30 + 25 = 55\n\\]\n\nWait, this matches the expected sum of 55. So, the earlier check was incorrect.\n\n#### **Moment of Clarity:**\n\nThe calculations are consistent. \\(c = 150\\) is correct because all Vieta\u2019s relationships are satisfied.\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nAfter carefully exploring different strategies and verifying each step, I've determined that \\(c = 150\\). Initially, I encountered a moment of confusion regarding the sum of the products of the roots, but a deeper reflection clarified that the calculations were indeed correct. Accepting that \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) are complex conjugates helped resolve the apparent inconsistency.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nc = 150\n\\]",
