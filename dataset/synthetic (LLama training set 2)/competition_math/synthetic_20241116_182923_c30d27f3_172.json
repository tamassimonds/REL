    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work regularly to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question: \n\n**\"How many distinct three-digit numbers can be written with the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 if no digit may be used more than once in a three-digit number?\"**\n\nMy initial reaction is that this involves **permutations** since we're dealing with arranging a set of digits where order matters and repetition isn't allowed. But looking at it, I realize there might be a constraint related to the **hundreds place** that makes it slightly different from a typical permutation problem.\n\nLet me brainstorm:\n\n- **Option 1:** Use permutations directly to count the arrangements of three digits from four.\n- **Option 2:** Consider the position of each digit (hundreds, tens, units) and calculate accordingly.\n- **Option 3:** List out all possible combinations manually to verify the total.\n- **Option 4:** Use a combinatorial approach to select digits and then arrange them.\n\nI'm leaning towards starting with **Option 2**, considering the position of each digit, because the hundreds place can't be zero (but we don't have zero here, so it's fine). If this doesn't work smoothly, I'll explore the other options.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Role of Each Digit's Position**\n\nLet me think about the positions in a three-digit number:\n\n- **Hundreds place:** Must be filled by one of the digits 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- **Tens place:** Can be any of the remaining three digits.\n- **Units place:** Can be any of the remaining two digits after filling the hundreds and tens places.\n\n**Reflection:** This makes sense because each position reduces the pool of available digits by one. It reminds me of calculating permutations but constrained by the specific digit positions.\n\n**Quick Check:** \n- Does it align with the rules of distinct digits? Yes.\n- Am I overcounting or undercounting? Not yet, but need to proceed carefully.\n\n**Plan:** Multiply the number of choices for each position.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Number of Choices for Each Position**\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n1. **Hundreds place:** \n   - 4 options (1, 2, 3, or 4)\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - 3 remaining options after selecting the hundreds digit\n\n3. **Units place:** \n   - 2 remaining options after selecting the hundreds and tens digits\n\nSo, the total number of distinct three-digit numbers is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n- **Does this number seem reasonable?** Yes, it's not too large considering the constraints.\n- **Is there a simpler way to verify?** Perhaps by considering the permutations of selecting and arranging three digits from four.\n\n**Plan:** To confirm, I'll consider **Option 4** where I select digits and then arrange them.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Alternative Approach \u2013 Selecting and Arranging Digits**\n\nLet\u2019s see if this method aligns with our previous calculation.\n\n1. **Select 3 digits from 4:**\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 digits from 4 is \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\).\n\n2. **Arrange the selected digits:**\n   - Each selection can be arranged in \\(3! = 6\\) ways.\n\nSo, total distinct numbers:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 6 = 24\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Is this consistent with our earlier calculation?** Yes, both methods yield 24.\n- **Does this confirm the correctness?** It adds confidence because we're approaching it differently but arriving at the same total.\n\n**Check:** \n- **Quick sanity check:** 4 selections each giving 6 arrangements makes sense with the digit constraints.\n- **No discrepancies noticed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying by Listing Some Examples**\n\nTo ensure our approach is correct, let's list a few distinct three-digit numbers formed by this process:\n\n- **Selecting 1, 2, 3:**\n  - 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321\n\n- **Selecting 1, 2, 4:**\n  - 124, 142, 214, 241, 412, 421\n\nAnd similarly for other selections.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Do these numbers adhere to the rules?** Yes, all digits are distinct and within the range.\n- **Are there any duplicates or missing combinations?** No, each selection generates unique permutations.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Counting the examples:** For each set of three digits, there are 6 permutations. With 4 sets, \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, calculating based on position constraints, and verifying by selecting and arranging digits, I'm confident that the number of distinct three-digit numbers is **24**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does the final answer align with all approaches?** Yes, all methods consistently lead to the same total.\n- **Is there anything overlooked?** No, the role of each digit's position and the permutations are well accounted for.\n- **Does this feel right?** Absolutely, the calculations are straightforward, and multiple approaches confirm the result.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying through multiple methods, I've ensured that the approach and the final answer are both correct and reliable. This process mimics human thinking, incorporating checks and flexibility to adapt if something doesn't seem right.",
