I'll try to think through it as a human would, making sure to check my work and adjust my approach when needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem states that the image of the point \\((1,1)\\) under reflection across the line \\(y = mx + b\\) is \\((9,5)\\). We need to find \\(m + b\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Understanding Reflection:** When a point is reflected across a line, the line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the original and reflected points. This is a fundamental property of reflections.\n  \n- **Given Points:** I have the original point \\((1, 1)\\) and the reflected point \\((9, 5)\\). Reflecting \\((1, 1)\\) to \\((9, 5)\\) means the line \\(y = mx + b\\) passes through the midpoint of these two points.\n\n- **Finding the Midpoint:** Maybe I can start by finding the midpoint to determine a point that lies on the reflecting line.\n\n- **Equation of the Line:** Once I have a point on the line, I might need to figure out the slope \\(m\\) and intercept \\(b\\) to write the equation of the line.\n\n- **Alternative Approaches:** Alternatively, I could use the properties of perpendicular slopes since the line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector.\n\n**Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure how to proceed, especially with finding \\(m\\) and \\(b\\). Maybe calculating the midpoint first is a good starting point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Midpoint**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start by finding the midpoint between \\((1, 1)\\) and \\((9, 5)\\). This point should lie on the line \\(y = mx + b\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nThe midpoint \\((M_x, M_y)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nM_x = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = \\frac{1 + 9}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\\[\nM_y = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = \\frac{1 + 5}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the midpoint is \\((5, 3)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, this makes sense because the midpoint should be equidistant from both original and reflected points. \\((5, 3)\\) is indeed halfway between \\((1, 1)\\) and \\((9, 5)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Slope \\(m\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have a point \\((5, 3)\\) on the line of reflection, I need to find the slope \\(m\\). I know that the line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector, so the slope of this line is perpendicular to the slope of the line connecting \\((1, 1)\\) and \\((9, 5)\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Find the Slope of the Connecting Line:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{5 - 1}{9 - 1} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Perpendicular Slope:**\n\n   The slope of the line of reflection \\(m\\) is the negative reciprocal of the connecting line's slope:\n\n   \\[\n   m = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = -2\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me double-check this. The slope of the connecting line is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), so the perpendicular slope should indeed be \\(-2\\). This feels right because perpendicular lines have slopes that multiply to \\(-1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Intercept \\(b\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the slope \\(m = -2\\), I need to find the intercept \\(b\\) to complete the equation of the line \\(y = mx + b\\). I can use the point \\((5, 3)\\) that lies on the line.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nPlugging the coordinates of the point into the line equation:\n\n\\[\n3 = -2(5) + b\n\\]\n\\[\n3 = -10 + b\n\\]\n\\[\nb = 3 + 10 = 13\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(b = 13\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me verify this. If \\(m = -2\\) and \\(b = 13\\), then the line equation is \\(y = -2x + 13\\). Plugging in the midpoint \\((5, 3)\\):\n\n\\[\n3 = -2(5) + 13 = -10 + 13 = 3\n\\]\n\nThis checks out. The point \\((5, 3)\\) lies on the line.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating \\(m + b\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFinally, I need to find \\(m + b\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nm + b = -2 + 13 = 11\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems straightforward. Adding the slope and intercept gives \\(11\\). I'll quickly check if everything aligns with the original problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me verify if the line \\(y = -2x + 13\\) correctly reflects the point \\((1, 1)\\) to \\((9, 5)\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Confirming Midpoint:**\n\n   The midpoint was calculated as \\((5, 3)\\), which lies on the line \\(y = -2x + 13\\).\n\n2. **Checking Reflection:**\n\n   If \\((5, 3)\\) is on the line, the distances from \\((1, 1)\\) to \\((5, 3)\\) and from \\((5, 3)\\) to \\((9, 5)\\) should be equal, and the line should bisect the segment perpendicularly.\n\n   - Distance from \\((1, 1)\\) to \\((5, 3)\\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{(5 - 1)^2 + (3 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 4} = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n\n   - Distance from \\((5, 3)\\) to \\((9, 5)\\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{(9 - 5)^2 + (5 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 4} = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n\n   Both distances are equal, confirming the reflection is accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nEverything checks out. The line \\(y = -2x + 13\\) correctly reflects \\((1, 1)\\) to \\((9, 5)\\), and \\(m + b = 11\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nm + b = 11\n\\]\n\n---\n\nAlright! Throughout this process, I started by identifying key properties of reflections, specifically that the reflecting line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the original and reflected points. By first finding the midpoint, I established a point on the reflecting line. Subsequently, I determined the slope of the reflecting line by leveraging the relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines. With both the slope and a point on the line, I found the y-intercept, completing the line's equation. Finally, I calculated \\(m + b\\) to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Always ensure to double-check each step, especially when dealing with geometric properties like reflections, as small errors can lead to incorrect conclusions.",

  "ground_truth": "The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection.  The slope of the segment is $\\frac{5-1}{9-1}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Since the line of reflection is perpendicular, its slope, $m$, equals $-2$.  By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment are $\\left(\\frac{9+1}2,\\frac{5+1}2\\right)=(5,3)$.   Since the line of reflection goes through this point, we have $3=(-2)(5)+b$, and so $b=13$.  Thus $m+b=-2+13=\\boxed{11}.$"
