    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore each step thoroughly, and check my work as I go. It\u2019s essential to mimic a human thought process\u2014complete with initial confusion, realizations, and corrections\u2014so let's approach it naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The question is asking for the **tenth positive integer** that is **both odd and a multiple of 3**.\n- Immediately, I recall that multiples of 3 include numbers like 3, 6, 9, etc.\n- Also, I remember that odd numbers are those not divisible by 2, like 1, 3, 5, etc.\n- **Brainstorming:** So, I need to find numbers that fit both categories\u2014being odd and multiples of 3. \n\nDoes it make sense so far? \n\n- **Reflection:** Yes, because all multiples of 3 that are also odd should be divisible by 3 but not by 2.\n\n**Possible Starting Strategies:**\n\n1. **List the Multiples of 3 and Filter for Odd Numbers:**\n   - This seems straightforward. I can list multiples of 3 and pick the odd ones until I reach the tenth one.\n\n2. **Use a Formula for Odd Multiples of 3:**\n   - Perhaps there's a pattern or formula I can use to find these numbers without listing them all.\n\n3. **Check with Modulo Arithmetic:**\n   - Maybe applying modulo operations could help identify odd multiples of 3 more systematically.\n\n**Brainstorming:** Let me start by listing the multiples of 3 and filtering for odd numbers. If that seems cumbersome, I\u2019ll explore other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Listing Multiples of 3 and Filtering for Odd Numbers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's list the first few multiples of 3: \n  - 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n  - 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n  - 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n  - 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n  - 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n  - 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n  - 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n  - 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n  - 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n\n- **Filtering for Odd Numbers:**\n  - From this list, the odd multiples of 3 are: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27.\n\n**Check:** Wait, I only have five numbers so far. The question asks for the **tenth**. \n\n- **Reflection:** Hmm, I need to continue listing beyond 30 to reach the tenth odd multiple of 3.\n\n**Continuing the List:**\n\n- 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n- 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (even, skip)\n- 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n- 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (even, skip)\n- 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n- 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (even, skip)\n- 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n- 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (even, skip)\n\n**Filtered Odd Multiples of 3:**\n\n- 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57\n\n**Check:** Is this correct? \n\n- **Quick Check:** Yes, these are all odd numbers and multiples of 3.\n- **Mistake Check:** Wait, I should ensure I'm only counting positive integers. All numbers listed are positive, so it's fine.\n\n**Final List of Tenth Odd Multiple of 3:**\n\n- The tenth number in this filtered list is **57**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I listed the first few multiples of 3 and picked out the odd ones.\n- This method works, but let me think if there's a more efficient way to arrive at the same answer without listing so many numbers.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is there a pattern or formula?** \n  - Yes! Odd multiples of 3 occur at every second multiple of 3, starting from 3.\n  - **If I list only the odd multiples of 3:** 3 \u00d7 1, 3 \u00d7 3, 3 \u00d7 5, etc.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\n- **Use a Formula:**\n  - The nth odd multiple of 3 can be represented as 3 \u00d7 (2n - 1), where n is the position in the odd sequence.\n\n- **Calculating the Tenth Odd Multiple of 3:**\n  - n = 10\n  - 3 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 10 - 1) = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n\n**Check:** Does this match? \n\n- **Comparison:** Yes, both methods\u2014listing and using the formula\u2014yield the same result: 57.\n- **Confirmation:** This alternative method is more efficient and confirms the correctness of the first approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I\u2019ve arrived at 57 using both listing and a formula approach.\n- **Quick Check:** Is 57 odd? Yes.\n- **Multiple of 3 Check:** 57 \u00f7 3 = 19, which is an integer.\n- **Position Check:** It\u2019s the tenth number in the filtered list.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does everything align?**\n  - Yes, all checks are satisfied: 57 is odd, a multiple of 3, and it's the tenth in the sequence.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n- The **tenth positive integer** that is **both odd and a multiple of 3 is 57**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Brainstorming and Exploring Strategies:** Started by listing multiples of 3 and filtering for odd numbers, which worked but was a bit lengthy. Realized a formula could streamline the process.\n- **Reflection and Checkpoints:** Constantly verified each step to ensure accuracy, checking that numbers were indeed odd and multiples of 3.\n- **Adaptability:** When the initial method seemed lengthy, switched to a more efficient formula-based approach, confirming correctness.\n- **Final Verification:** Used multiple methods to arrive at and verify the final answer, ensuring reliability.\n\nThis thorough, human-like approach\u2014complete with brainstorming, checking, and reflecting\u2014ensured that the correct answer was reached confidently.",
