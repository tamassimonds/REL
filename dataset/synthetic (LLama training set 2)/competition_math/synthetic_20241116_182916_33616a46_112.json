    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming as I go. It's important to approach it like I would if I were solving it on paper, with initial thoughts, exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing direction if needed.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I notice it's about a matrix that corresponds to projecting onto a certain vector. My initial reaction is:\n\n- **Hmm, I remember something about projection matrices from linear algebra.** They have specific forms and properties.\n- **Wait, I'm asked to find \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\),** which suggests the vector onto which we're projecting might be related to the components \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n- **This looks similar to problems where you need to identify the direction vector from a given projection matrix.** But I'm not entirely sure how to proceed immediately.\n\nAt this point, I'm brainstorming various strategies:\n\n1. **Recall the formula for a projection matrix.** I know that projectors onto a vector have a specific structure.\n2. **Attempt to match the given matrix to a known form.** Maybe identify the vector by comparing components.\n3. **Consider if there's a relationship between the matrix elements and the vector components.** Perhaps \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) relate to the elements of the matrix.\n\nBut I'm not confident yet, so let's explore these ideas.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Recall the Projection Matrix Formula**\n\nI remember that the projection matrix \\( P \\) onto a unit vector \\( \\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 & ab \\\\ ab & b^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **If I can express the given matrix in this form,** I can identify \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), which are the components of the vector onto which we're projecting.\n- **This approach seems logical,** but I need to ensure it aligns with the given matrix.\n\n**Applying the Strategy:**\n\nGiven matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{4}{29} & -\\frac{10}{29} \\\\ -\\frac{10}{29} & \\frac{25}{29} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Matching Components:**\n\n- Comparing with \\( P = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 & ab \\\\ ab & b^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\):\n  - \\( a^2 = \\frac{4}{29} \\)\n  - \\( ab = -\\frac{10}{29} \\)\n  - \\( b^2 = \\frac{25}{29} \\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):**\n   - From \\( a^2 = \\frac{4}{29} \\), \\( a = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{29}} = \\pm \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}} \\)\n   - From \\( b^2 = \\frac{25}{29} \\), \\( b = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{29}} = \\pm \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}} \\)\n   \n   Wait a moment\u2014**should I choose the signs?** Since the projection matrix involves both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the signs need to satisfy \\( ab = -\\frac{10}{29} \\).\n\n   Let's see:\n\n   - If \\( a = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}} \\) and \\( b = -\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}} \\), then:\n     \\[\n     ab = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}} \\times -\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}} = -\\frac{10}{29}\n     \\]\n     **This matches** the given matrix.\n\n   - **Alternative Signs:** If \\( a = -\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}} \\) and \\( b = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}} \\), the same product \\( ab = -\\frac{10}{29} \\) occurs.\n\n   **Reflection:**\n\n   - **Both sign combinations work,** but typically, projection matrices are defined with the vector components having the same signs to maintain direction consistency.\n   - **I\u2019ll proceed with \\( a = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}} \\) and \\( b = -\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}} \\).**\n\n**Result:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}} \\\\ -\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Verifying the Projection Matrix**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Wait, let me ensure that this vector indeed creates the given projection matrix.** It\u2019s crucial to verify that the matrix formed by \\( \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u}^T \\) aligns with the provided matrix.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Calculate \\( \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u}^T \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}} \\\\ -\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}} & -\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}}\\right)^2 & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}} \\times -\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}} \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}} \\times -\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}} & \\left(-\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}}\\right)^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{4}{29} & -\\frac{10}{29} \\\\ -\\frac{10}{29} & \\frac{25}{29} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **This matches exactly with the given matrix,** so the vector is correctly identified.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **It seems my initial strategy works well.** The vector components are correctly identified, and the projection matrix aligns with the given one.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Calculate \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) Directly**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Now, I need to find \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\).** Since we've identified the vector components, this ratio should be straightforward.\n- **But let me double-check that the signs and magnitudes are correct to ensure the ratio makes sense.**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}} \\\\ -\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{-\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{29}}}{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{29}}} = \\frac{-5}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Wait, does this make sense?**\n\n- **The negative sign indicates the direction of the vector components,** which aligns with the original matrix having negative off-diagonal elements.\n- **The magnitude of the ratio is \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\),** suggesting that the \\( y \\)-component is \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\) times the \\( x \\)-component in absolute value.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This ratio seems reasonable.** It reflects the relationship between the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) components of the vector used in the projection.\n- **I\u2019ll move forward with this being the correct answer.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying each step, the ratio \\( \\frac{y}{x} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{-5}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does this align with the properties of a projection matrix?** Yes, the negative off-diagonal elements correspond to the negative \\( ab \\) product, and the diagonal elements represent \\( a^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\).\n- **Is the ratio consistent with the identified vector components?** Absolutely, the signs and magnitudes check out.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **My initial approach worked well,** and by verifying the projection matrix's formation, I ensured the correctness of the vector components.\n- **Exploring alternative strategies reinforced the solution,** and checking the work continuously helped catch any potential errors early on.\n\n**End of Solution**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nBy systematically recalling the projection matrix formula, verifying the vector components, and then directly calculating the desired ratio while checking for consistency, I arrived at \\( \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{-5}{2} \\). Throughout the process, reflecting on each step and being open to adjusting the approach ensured the solution's accuracy.",
