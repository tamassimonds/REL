Specifically, the argument of a logarithm must be greater than zero.\n  \n- **Fraction Inside Logarithm:** There\u2019s a fraction, so both the numerator and denominator play a role. This reminds me of problems involving rational expressions and their domains.\n\n- **Quadratic in Denominator:** The denominator is \\(x^2 - 5\\), which is a quadratic expression. Quadratic expressions can have zeroes, leading to undefined points in the fraction.\n\n**Initial Idea:**\n\nPerhaps I need to find where \\(\\frac{x-2}{x^2-5}\\) is **not defined** first, as that would give me values **not in the domain** of the logarithm.\n\nBut wait... I also need to ensure that the fraction is **greater than zero** because the logarithm's argument must be positive.\n\nSo, maybe I need to find values where the fraction is undefined and where it's less than or equal to zero.\n\nDoes that make sense? Let's see.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Factor the Denominator and Find Zeroes**\n\nMy first thought is to factor the denominator \\(x^2 - 5\\) to find where the fraction is undefined.\n\n- **Factoring:** \n  \\[\n  x^2 - 5 = (x - \\sqrt{5})(x + \\sqrt{5})\n  \\]\n  \n  **Reflection:**\n  \n  Wait, that\u2019s good. By finding the roots, I can identify the points where the fraction is undefined, which are \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nI\u2019ll also need to check where the fraction is positive because logarithms require positive arguments. This might involve testing intervals.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBut wait, just finding where the denominator is zero isn\u2019t enough. I also need to ensure that the fraction itself is positive, so I need to consider both the numerator and denominator.\n\n**Let\u2019s proceed with this strategy and see if it works.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identify Points Where the Fraction is Undefined**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSet the denominator equal to zero:\n\\[\nx^2 - 5 = 0 \\implies x = \\pm \\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so at \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\) and \\(x = -\\sqrt{5}\\), the fraction is undefined. This makes sense because division by zero is undefined.\n\nBut these are just the points where the fraction is undefined. I also need to consider where the fraction is **less than or equal to zero**.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nHmm, I might be missing something. The question asks for the largest value **not in the domain**, so I should focus on the largest value that makes the fraction undefined or negative.\n\nLet me think about it: The largest value that makes the fraction undefined is \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\). However, there might be other values where the fraction is negative.\n\n**Wait, I need to ensure I\u2019m not overlooking anything.**\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 2: Analyze the Sign of the Fraction**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll analyze where \\(\\frac{x-2}{x^2-5}\\) is positive or negative by testing intervals around the points where the denominator is zero.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis should help me identify not only where the fraction is undefined but also where it\u2019s negative, ensuring I capture all values **not in the domain** of the logarithm.\n\n**Let\u2019s proceed with this strategy.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Test Intervals to Determine the Sign of the Fraction**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nI\u2019ll test the sign of \\(\\frac{x-2}{x^2-5}\\) in the intervals:\n1. \\( (-\\infty, -\\sqrt{5}) \\)\n2. \\( (-\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{5}) \\)\n3. \\( (\\sqrt{5}, \\infty) \\)\n\n**Interval 1: \\( (-\\infty, -\\sqrt{5}) \\)**\n- Choose \\(x = -3\\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{-3-2}{(-3)^2-5} = \\frac{-5}{9-5} = \\frac{-5}{4} < 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  \n  So, in this interval, the fraction is negative.\n\n**Interval 2: \\( (-\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{5}) \\)**\n- Choose \\(x = 0\\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{0-2}{0^2-5} = \\frac{-2}{-5} = \\frac{2}{5} > 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  \n  Here, the fraction is positive.\n\n**Interval 3: \\( (\\sqrt{5}, \\infty) \\)**\n- Choose \\(x = 3\\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3-2}{3^2-5} = \\frac{1}{9-5} = \\frac{1}{4} > 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  \n  In this interval, the fraction is also positive.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait a minute... I see that the fraction is negative in the first interval and positive in the second and third intervals. So, the largest value where the fraction is negative is at the boundary of these intervals.\n\nBut, the problem asks for the largest value **not in the domain**. The largest value where the fraction is undefined is \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\), but it\u2019s also where the sign changes.\n\n**Hmm, I need to consider both points where the fraction is undefined and where it\u2019s negative.**\n\n**Realization:**\n\nI think I need to focus on where the fraction is undefined and also consider the sign to ensure I\u2019m capturing all cases where the logarithm\u2019s argument is invalid.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 3: Consider Both Undefined Points and Negative Values**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nLet\u2019s combine the findings: The fraction is undefined at \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{5}\\), and also, in the interval \\( (-\\infty, -\\sqrt{5}) \\), the fraction is negative.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis means that any value \\(x\\) where the fraction is either undefined or negative is **not in the domain** of the logarithm.\n\n**Let\u2019s list these values:**\n\n1. Undefined at \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\) and \\(x = -\\sqrt{5}\\)\n2. Negative in the interval \\( (-\\infty, -\\sqrt{5}) \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSo, the largest value **not in the domain** is \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\), since it\u2019s the largest point where the fraction is undefined.\n\nBut, there are also values less than \\(-\\sqrt{5}\\) where the fraction is negative.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nI need to ensure that the final answer is the largest such value. Since the question specifically asks for the largest value **not in the domain**, and \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\) is the largest point where the fraction is undefined, it makes sense to consider \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\) as the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Confirming the Answer**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet\u2019s double-check: The largest value where the fraction is undefined is \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\). Although the fraction is also negative for values less than \\(-\\sqrt{5}\\), \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\) is the largest such value that causes the fraction to be undefined.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nDoes it make sense? Yes, because \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\) is the boundary where the fraction transitions from being undefined to having a defined value.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nWait, could there be other values affecting the domain that I missed? Let me think... The only points impacting the domain are where the denominator is zero and where the fraction is negative.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI\u2019ve considered both undefined points and negative values, and \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\) is indeed the largest value **not in the domain** of the logarithm.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014factoring the denominator, analyzing the sign of the fraction, and considering both undefined points and negative values\u2014I determined that the largest value **not in the domain** of \\(\\log\\frac{x-2}{x^2-5}\\) is \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\).\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected and checked each step to ensure the approach was correct, adjusting as needed to arrive at the final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "In order for $\\dfrac{x-2}{x^2-5}$ to be defined, we must have $x^2 - 5 \\not = 0$. So, $x \\not = \\pm \\sqrt 5$.\n\nIn order for $\\log \\dfrac{x-2}{x^2-5}$ to be defined, we must have $\\dfrac{x-2}{x^2 - 5} > 0$. There are two cases to consider: when $x^2 - 5 > 0$ and when $x^2 - 5 < 0$.\n\nCase 1: $x^2 - 5 > 0$. Since $x^2 - 5 > 0$, we have that $x < -\\sqrt{5}$ or $x > \\sqrt 5$. From $\\dfrac{x-2}{x^2 - 5} > 0$, we have $x -2 > 0$, or $x > 2$. Combining all of these facts, we must have $x > \\sqrt 5$.\n\nCase 2: $x^2 - 5 < 0$. Since $x^2 - 5 < 0$, we have that $-\\sqrt 5 < x < \\sqrt 5$. From $\\dfrac{x-2}{x^2 - 5} > 0$, we have that $x - 2 < 0$, or $x < 2$. Combining all of these facts, we must have $-\\sqrt 5 < x < 2$.\n\nSo, we must have $-\\sqrt 5 < x < 2$ or $x > \\sqrt 5$. (We can also write this as $x = (-\\sqrt 5 , 2) \\cup (\\sqrt 5, \\infty)$.) The largest value not in the domain is therefore $\\boxed{\\sqrt 5}$."
