    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just as I would if I were working on it myself.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Okay, this problem involves students taking either history or science, with some taking both. I\u2019ve seen similar problems before, maybe something related to Venn diagrams or the principle of inclusion-exclusion. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the right path.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:**\n  - **Venn Diagram:** This seems like a good visual way to represent the overlaps between different groups.\n  - **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Maybe using this principle can help account for the students taking both subjects without double-counting them.\n  - **Simple Arithmetic:** Perhaps adding and subtracting the numbers given could lead to the solution.\n\n- **Feeling Stuck:** I'm noticing multiple potential strategies, but I'm unsure which one will be the most straightforward. Perhaps starting with a Venn diagram to visualize might help?\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting with a Venn Diagram**\n\nLet's try to sketch out a Venn diagram in our minds to see how things fit.\n\n- **Components of the Diagram:**\n  - **Circles for History and Science:** Two overlapping circles representing students taking history and science.\n  - **Intersection:** The overlapping area represents students taking both subjects.\n\n- **Given Information:**\n  - **Total in History (H):** 106\n  - **Total in Science (S):** 109\n  - **Total Taking Both (H \u2229 S):** 85\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, I'm not sure how to find the total number of students in the senior class just by looking at this. Maybe I need to think of another method.\n\n### **Step 2: Considering the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n\nHmm, maybe the inclusion-exclusion principle could help here to avoid double-counting students taking both subjects.\n\n- **Inclusion-Exclusion Formula:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Students} = H + S - (H \\cap S)\n  \\]\n\n- **Plugging in the Numbers:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Students} = 106 + 109 - 85\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Students} = 215 - 85 = 130\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Alright, so according to this calculation, there are 130 students in the senior class. Let me think this through.\n\n### **Reflection on Step 2**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Let's see:\n  - **Total in History:** 106\n  - **Total in Science:** 109\n  - **Overlapping (Both Subjects):** 85\n\n  By adding those who take only history and only science, and then subtracting the overlap (students taking both), getting 130 seems logical.\n\n- **Quick Check:** But wait, the number of students taking both subjects (85) is quite high compared to the totals in each subject. Does this mean almost all history students also take science? Hmm, this seems a bit off.\n\n- **Realization:** Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the inclusion-exclusion formula.\n\n### **Step 3: Reapplying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle Carefully**\n\nOkay, let's carefully apply the formula again to ensure correctness.\n\n- **Formula Revisited:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Students} = (H - H \\cap S) + (S - H \\cap S) + (H \\cap S)\n  \\]\n\n  That is, add those taking only history, those taking only science, and those taking both.\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  \n  - **Only History:** \\( H - H \\cap S = 106 - 85 = 21 \\)\n  - **Only Science:** \\( S - H \\cap S = 109 - 85 = 24 \\)\n  - **Both Subjects:** \\( H \\cap S = 85 \\)\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Students} = 21 + 24 + 85 = 130\n  \\]\n\n- **Still 130:** Hmm, we're still arriving at the same total. But reflecting on it, it seems consistent with the numbers provided.\n\n### **Step 4: Checking the Reasonableness of the Answer**\n\nNow, let's consider if having 130 students makes sense.\n\n- **Proportionate Overlap:** If 85 students are taking both subjects, that\u2019s a significant overlap, but it could be plausible if many students are double majors or if the courses are popular among the same students.\n\n- **Total Matches:** Adding those taking only history (21), only science (24), and both (85) gives 130, aligning with the calculated total.\n\n- **No Contradictions:** The numbers don't contradict any given information, and the calculations are straightforward.\n\n### **Final Check: Validating the Approach**\n\n- **Approach Validation:** Using the inclusion-exclusion principle seems appropriate here, as it accounts for all students without double-counting those enrolled in both subjects.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** A Venn diagram helped visualize the problem, and the arithmetic checks confirm the totals align.\n\n- **Confidence in Answer:** Given that all steps consistently lead to the same total and there's no contradiction in the data provided, I feel confident that the senior class comprises **130 students**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully applying the inclusion-exclusion principle and verifying each step, we concluded that there are **130 students** in the senior class. Throughout the process, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and rechecking calculations ensured the approach was correct and the answer valid.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, complete with reflections and checks, mimics natural human problem-solving, acknowledging initial uncertainties, exploring multiple paths, and confirming correctness before finalizing the answer.",

  "ground_truth": "We see 106 seniors are taking history and 109 seniors are taking science. If we add those numbers of seniors up, we still have to subtract the number of seniors that are taking both history and science because we counted them twice. So there is a total of $106+109-85=\\boxed{130}$ students in the senior class."
