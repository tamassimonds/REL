    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, check my work along the way, and make sure to reflect often to ensure I'm on the right track. Let\u2019s start by really understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**User Query:**\nA fair 6-sided die is rolled. If I roll \\( n \\), then I win \\( n^2 \\) dollars. What is the expected value of my win? Express your answer as a dollar value rounded to the nearest cent.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Similarity to Previous Problems:** This reminds me of calculating the expected value in probability. I\u2019ve done that before with simple random variables.\n  \n- **Recalling Strategies:** I typically think of multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing them up. Does that apply here?\n\n- **Possible Approaches:**\n  1. **List All Outcomes:** Calculate the winnings for each possible roll and find their average.\n  2. **Use Probability Theory:** Since the die is fair, each outcome has an equal probability.\n  3. **Check for Shortcuts:** Perhaps there's a quicker way by using properties of expected value.\n\n**Reflection:** Given that it's a fair die, each side has an equal chance. So, I think listing all outcomes and their probabilities makes sense. But let me explore if there's a more efficient method.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: List All Outcomes and Their Probabilities**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Write down each possible roll (1 to 6), calculate \\( n^2 \\) for each, and find the average considering each outcome's probability.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - Roll 1: Wins \\( 1^2 = 1 \\) dollar\n  - Roll 2: Wins \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) dollars\n  - Roll 3: Wins \\( 3^2 = 9 \\) dollars\n  - Roll 4: Wins \\( 4^2 = 16 \\) dollars\n  - Roll 5: Wins \\( 5^2 = 25 \\) dollars\n  - Roll 6: Wins \\( 6^2 = 36 \\) dollars\n\n- **Total Possible Outcomes:** Since it's a 6-sided die, there are 6 possible outcomes.\n\n- **Probability of Each Outcome:** \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) because the die is fair.\n\n- **Expected Value Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Expected Value} = \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\times 4 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\times 9 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\times 16 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\times 25 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\times 36 \\right)\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplifying:**\n  \n  \\[\n  = \\frac{1}{6} \\times (1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36) = \\frac{91}{6} \\approx 15.17\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a minute... That seems like a lot of money for a die roll. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Check**\n\n- **Addition Check:**\n  \n  \\[\n  1 + 4 = 5 \\\\\n  5 + 9 = 14 \\\\\n  14 + 16 = 30 \\\\\n  30 + 25 = 55 \\\\\n  55 + 36 = 91\n  \\]\n\n  **Total:** 91\n\n- **Multiplication Check:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{91}{6} \\approx 15.17\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion of Check:** The addition is correct, but the expected value still seems high. Is there something off?\n\n---\n\n### **Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n**Reflection:** The expected value of approximately $15.17 seems too high for a single die roll. I must have made a mistake in my calculations. Let me re-examine my steps.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Using the Property of Expected Value**\n\n**Thought Process:** I recall that the expected value can also be calculated by recognizing that the expected value of a function of a random variable can be simplified. In this case, since \\( n^2 \\) is a function of \\( n \\), I might be able to use properties of expected values to simplify my calculations.\n\n**Revised Calculation:**\n\n- **Realizing a Shortcut:**\n  \n  The expected value of \\( n^2 \\) can be expressed as:\n  \n  \\[\n  E[n^2] = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} i^2 \\times P(i)\n  \\]\n  \n  where \\( P(i) = \\frac{1}{6} \\) for each side.\n\n- **Calculating the Sum of Squares:**\n  \n  \\[\n  1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 = 91\n  \\]\n\n- **Expected Value:**\n  \n  \\[\n  E[n^2] = \\frac{91}{6} \\approx 15.17\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** I'm getting the same expected value again. This reinforces that my initial approach was correct in terms of calculations, but the expected value still feels high. Let\u2019s think more about whether this is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Reasonability Check**\n\n**Thought Process:** Does winning $15.17 for a single die roll make sense? Considering the maximum win is \\( 6^2 = 36 \\) dollars, and the minimum is \\( 1^2 = 1 \\) dollar, an average of $15.17 seems plausible, especially since higher squares contribute more to the average due to their larger values.\n\n**Conclusion:** The expected value calculation is correct. The average is skewed towards higher amounts because squaring the roll increases the value significantly, especially for higher numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the calculations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Value} = \\frac{91}{6} \\approx 15.17\n\\]\n\n**Expressed as a dollar value rounded to the nearest cent:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{15.17}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout this problem, I explored different strategies to ensure accuracy. Initially, I listed all outcomes and their probabilities, calculated the expected value, and ended up with $15.17. At first glance, this seemed high, prompting me to re-evaluate my approach.\n\nBy recognizing the properties of expected values and double-checking my calculations, I confirmed that the expected value is indeed $15.17. Although the amount might seem substantial for a single die roll, the squaring function significantly skews the average towards higher values, making the result reasonable.\n\nOverall, reflecting and checking my work ensured the correctness of the solution, leading to a confident and accurate final answer.",
