    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect along the way, check my work frequently, and think out loud about my thought process, including any mistakes or realizations.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, it involves triangle \\( ABC \\) with specific side lengths and a point \\( D \\) where the perpendicular from \\( A \\) meets \\( BC \\). I see that \\( BD : CD = 2 : 5 \\), and I need to find \\( AD \\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Right Triangle Involvement:** The perpendicular from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\) suggests we're dealing with a right triangle, specifically with \\( AD \\) being the altitude.\n  \n- **Proportions Given:** The ratio \\( BD : CD = 2 : 5 \\) might imply that \\( D \\) divides \\( BC \\) in a specific proportion, which could help in setting up equations.\n\n- **Pythagorean Theorem Possibility:** Given two sides and the altitude, perhaps the Pythagorean theorem will come into play.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** Since \\( AD \\) is the altitude, maybe relate the sides of the triangle using Pythagoras.\n\n2. **Apply the Law of Cosines:** If I can find angles, perhaps the Law of Cosines could help relate the sides and angles.\n\n3. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:** Assign coordinates to the points and calculate distances directly.\n\n4. **Trigonometric Ratios:** Use trigonometric identities to relate the given ratios to angles and sides.\n\n**Which to Try First?**\n\nPythagorean Theorem seems straightforward since I have the lengths and an altitude. If that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll consider using trigonometric ratios or coordinate geometry.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s see if I can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate \\( AB \\), \\( AC \\), and \\( AD \\) directly. \n\nBut wait, I notice I need \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\) to find \\( AD \\) through Pythagoras. Since I don't have those yet, I need a way to express \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\) in terms of known lengths or \\( AD \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI realize I can't directly use Pythagoras without knowing \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\). So this approach doesn't seem immediately helpful. Maybe I need to find \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\) first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Using the Given Ratio \\( BD : CD = 2 : 5 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven the ratio \\( BD : CD = 2 : 5 \\), I can express \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\) in terms of a common variable.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n\\[\nBD = 2k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad CD = 5k\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a positive scalar.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Total Length:** Does this make sense? Yes, because \\( BD + CD = 2k + 5k = 7k \\), which is the length of \\( BC \\).\n\nBut wait\u2014do I know the length of \\( BC \\)? I don't have that information directly. Hmm, maybe I can relate \\( BC \\) to \\( AB \\) and \\( AC \\) using the given ratios.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSince \\( BC \\)'s length isn't given, I need another way to connect \\( k \\) to the known lengths \\( AB = 10 \\) and \\( AC = 17 \\). Perhaps setting up equations using the Pythagorean theorem might help.\n\n**Adjustment:**\n\nSince I don\u2019t have \\( BC \\), maybe I should consider finding another relationship involving angles or using trigonometric identities.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Reconsidering the Approach\u2014Using Trigonometric Ratios**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAnother way to approach this is by using trigonometric ratios involving the ratios of the sides and the altitude.\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the ratio of the sides opposite to angles is related to the tangents of those angles, especially since \\( D \\) is the foot of the altitude.\n\n**Let me think:**\n\n- **Sine and Cosine Relations:** Perhaps relate \\( \\sin \\) and \\( \\cos \\) of angles at \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) to the sides and the altitude \\( AD \\).\n\n- **Use of Ratios:** The given \\( BD : CD \\) can help set up equations involving angles at \\( B \\) and \\( C \\).\n\n**But wait:**\n\n- **Complexity:** This seems a bit complex and requires knowing angles or additional lengths that I don\u2019t have directly.\n\n- **Need for Angles:** Without knowing the angles, this might not be straightforward.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nTrigonometric ratios might not be the best first approach without additional information about angles.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nMaybe I need to stick with finding lengths first and see if trigonometric identities can simplify later steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Reverting Back\u2014Using the Pythagorean Theorem with Defined Proportions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGo back to attempting the Pythagorean theorem, but now incorporate the ratio \\( BD : CD = 2 : 5 \\) to express \\( BC \\) in terms of \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\).\n\nIf \\( BD = 2k \\) and \\( CD = 5k \\), then:\n\n\\[\nBC = BD + CD = 2k + 5k = 7k\n\\]\n\n**But I still don\u2019t have \\( k \\).**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt seems I need to find another relationship to determine \\( k \\) or directly find \\( AD \\) without knowing \\( BC \\).\n\n**Adjustment:**\n\nPerhaps I need to use the area of the triangle or another geometric property that relates these lengths.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: New Strategy\u2014Using the Area of Triangle \\( ABC \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s think about the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) and how the altitude \\( AD \\) relates to it.\n\nThe area can be calculated in two ways:\n\n1. Using the base \\( BC \\) and altitude \\( AD \\): \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times BC \\times AD\n   \\]\n\n2. Using the sides \\( AB \\) and \\( AC \\) along with angle \\( A \\) (which I don\u2019t know yet, but it's an option).\n\n**Wait\u2014do I have enough information?**\n\n- **Base \\( BC \\):** Not directly known.\n- **Need to find \\( AD \\):** That\u2019s what I\u2019m solving for.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis path doesn\u2019t seem immediately helpful since I still need \\( BC \\) to find the area, and without knowing angles, I can't proceed.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nPerhaps another relationship involving \\( BC \\) can help, but since multiple attempts are leading nowhere, I might need to reconsider the approach entirely.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Simplifying the Approach\u2014Using Similar Triangles or Ratios**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe instead of focusing directly on finding \\( AD \\), I can look at the ratios and see if similar triangles or other geometric properties can simplify the problem.\n\n**Possible Ideas:**\n\n- **Similar Triangles:** Check if triangle \\( ABD \\) and \\( ACD \\) are similar to another triangle.\n  \n- **Proportional Segments:** Since \\( BD : CD = 2 : 5 \\), perhaps the segments relate to the angles or other sides proportionally.\n\n**But wait:**\n\nWithout additional angles or relationships, this approach might not give a direct path to \\( AD \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt seems that without more information, such as angles or additional side lengths, this approach might not lead directly to the solution.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nTime to rethink and perhaps consider checking if the problem can be solved using the Law of Cosines or looking for alternative geometric properties that involve the altitude.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Exploring the Law of Cosines**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s see if the Law of Cosines can relate the sides and the altitude somehow.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(\\theta)\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( c \\) is the side opposite angle \\( \\theta \\), and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the other two sides.\n\n**Applying It Here:**\n\n- **Sides \\( AB \\) and \\( AC \\):** Given as 10 and 17, respectively.\n  \n- **Need \\( BC \\) and angle \\( A \\):** But since I don\u2019t have \\( BC \\) or angle \\( A \\), this approach doesn't help directly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWithout knowing \\( BC \\) or angle \\( A \\), the Law of Cosines doesn't advance the solution.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince multiple approaches haven't worked, perhaps it's time to consider re-evaluating the given information or looking for a clever geometric relationship that's been overlooked.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Rethinking the Given Ratio\u2014Relating \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\) with the Sides**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven the ratio \\( BD : CD = 2 : 5 \\), perhaps I can relate these segments to the sides \\( AB = 10 \\) and \\( AC = 17 \\) by leveraging the properties of similar triangles or the altitude in a right triangle.\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\nIn a triangle, the ratios of the sides relate to the segments on the opposite side created by an angle bisector or altitude. However, since \\( D \\) is the foot of the perpendicular, this is more about right triangles and Pythagorean relationships.\n\n**Let\u2019s Try:**\n\nSince \\( D \\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\), we can consider the right triangles \\( ABD \\) and \\( ACD \\). Perhaps the sides \\( AB \\) and \\( AC \\) relate to \\( AD \\) and the segments \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\).\n\n**Setting Up Ratios:**\n\nGiven \\( BD : CD = 2 : 5 \\), I can express:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{BD}{CD} = \\frac{2}{5} \\Rightarrow \\frac{2k}{5k} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nWhich is consistent, so no issues there.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems to be on the right track but still needs a concrete relationship to find \\( AD \\).\n\n**Decision:**\n\nPerhaps use the Pythagorean theorem involving \\( BD \\), \\( CD \\), and \\( AD \\) to link everything together.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Applying Pythagorean Theorem in Right Triangles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s apply the Pythagorean theorem in triangles \\( ABD \\) and \\( ACD \\) to relate \\( AD \\), \\( BD \\), and \\( CD \\).\n\n**For Triangle \\( ABD \\):**\n\n\\[\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( AB = 10 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n10^2 = AD^2 + (2k)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n100 = AD^2 + 4k^2\n\\]\n\n**For Triangle \\( ACD \\):**\n\n\\[\nAC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( AC = 17 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n17^2 = AD^2 + (5k)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n289 = AD^2 + 25k^2\n\\]\n\n**Now, I have two equations:**\n\n1. \\( 100 = AD^2 + 4k^2 \\)\n2. \\( 289 = AD^2 + 25k^2 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is a system of equations that can be solved for \\( AD \\) and \\( k \\).\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \\( AD^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n(289 - 100) = (AD^2 + 25k^2) - (AD^2 + 4k^2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n189 = 21k^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{189}{21} = 9\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = 3 \\quad (\\text{since } k \\text{ is positive})\n\\]\n\n**Wait\u2014Check the Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{189}{21} = 9 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = 3 \\quad \\text{(So, } BD = 2k = 6 \\text{ and } CD = 5k = 15\\text{)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe values seem reasonable. \\( BD = 6 \\) and \\( CD = 15 \\) makes the ratio \\( 2 : 5 \\), which is consistent.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nProceed to find \\( AD \\) using \\( k = 3 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Solving for \\( AD \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have \\( k = 3 \\), plug it back into one of the equations to find \\( AD \\).\n\n**Using the First Equation:**\n\n\\[\n100 = AD^2 + 4k^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n100 = AD^2 + 4(3)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n100 = AD^2 + 36\n\\]\n\n\\[\nAD^2 = 100 - 36 = 64\n\\]\n\n\\[\nAD = \\sqrt{64} = 8\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Positive Value:** \\( AD = 8 \\), which makes sense as a length.\n- **Consistent with Ratios:** \\( BD = 6 \\) and \\( CD = 15 \\), maintaining the \\( 2 : 5 \\) ratio.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe value \\( AD = 8 \\) fits well with the given ratios and side lengths. It checks out with the Pythagorean theorem equations.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nThe altitude \\( AD \\) is **8**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nLooking back, I initially struggled to connect \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\) with the known side lengths without directly knowing \\( BC \\). After brainstorming and realizing that the Pythagorean theorem needed both \\( BD \\) and \\( CD \\), I leveraged the given ratio to express these segments in terms of a common variable.\n\nBy setting up a system of equations based on the right triangles \\( ABD \\) and \\( ACD \\), I could solve for \\( k \\) and subsequently find \\( AD \\).\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected on the effectiveness of each approach, discarded strategies that didn\u2019t lead me closer to the solution, and ensured that each step logically followed the previous one.\n\nThis step-by-step exploration, including checking and correcting paths, led me to the correct solution: \\( AD = 8 \\).",
