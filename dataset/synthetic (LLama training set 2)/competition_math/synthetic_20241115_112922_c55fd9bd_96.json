I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work as I go, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let\u2019s start by fully understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nOkay, the problem asks me to compute \\(91^2\\) in my head. Squaring a number means multiplying it by itself, so I need to find \\(91 \\times 91\\).  \n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nWhen I see \\(91^2\\), I immediately think of the formula for squaring a binomial: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Perhaps I can express 91 in a way that fits this formula. But let me brainstorm a few different strategies first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1:**  \n**Use the Binomial Squaring Formula**  \nExpress 91 as \\(90 + 1\\) and apply \\((a + b)^2\\).\n\n**Strategy 2:**  \n**Memorization of Perfect Squares**  \nRecall that \\(90^2 = 8100\\) and \\(1^2 = 1\\) and see if that helps.\n\n**Strategy 3:**  \n**Long Multiplication Method**  \nMultiply 91 by 91 using the traditional long multiplication approach.\n\n**Strategy 4:**  \n**Use Approximation and Adjustment**  \nSince 91 is close to 100, maybe use \\(100 - 9\\) and apply \\((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n**Wait a Moment...**  \nHmm, the binomial formulas seem promising because they leverage the structure of the number. Long multiplication is more straightforward but might take more steps mentally. Approximating around 100 could also work well because 91 is close to 100.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nI'll start with **Strategy 1**, using the binomial squaring formula, because it utilizes a method I'm familiar with for handling numbers near 100. If that feels off, I'll switch to another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying Strategy 1 \u2013 Binomial Squaring Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s express 91 as \\(90 + 1\\). According to the binomial formula:  \n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]  \nHere, \\(a = 90\\) and \\(b = 1\\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\\[\n91^2 = (90 + 1)^2 = 90^2 + 2 \\times 90 \\times 1 + 1^2\n\\]  \nBreaking it down:  \n- \\(90^2 = 8100\\)  \n- \\(2 \\times 90 \\times 1 = 180\\)  \n- \\(1^2 = 1\\)  \n\nAdding them together:  \n\\[\n8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281\n\\]  \n\n**Check:**  \nLet me quickly check if this makes sense.  \n- \\(90^2 = 8100\\), which is correct.  \n- \\(2 \\times 90 \\times 1 = 180\\), that\u2019s also correct.  \n- Adding 1 doesn\u2019t change the overall count much.\n\n**Natural Reflection:**  \nThat seems a bit larger than I expected. But then again, squaring 91 should give a number close to \\(90^2\\) with some adjustments for the extra 1.  \n\n**Moment of Doubt:**  \nWait, does \\(91^2\\) really need to be that high? Let me verify by considering another approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Checking with Strategy 4 \u2013 Approximation and Adjustment**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s try approximating \\(91^2\\) using the formula for squaring a number close to 100:  \n\\[\n(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\n\\]  \nHere, \\(a = 100\\) and \\(b = 9\\) because \\(91 = 100 - 9\\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\\[\n91^2 = (100 - 9)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \\times 100 \\times 9 + 9^2\n\\]  \nBreaking it down:  \n- \\(100^2 = 10000\\)  \n- \\(2 \\times 100 \\times 9 = 1800\\)  \n- \\(9^2 = 81\\)  \n\nSubtracting and adding accordingly:  \n\\[\n10000 - 1800 + 81 = 10000 - 1719 = 8281\n\\]  \n\n**Check:**  \nLet me verify this calculation.  \n- \\(100^2 = 10000\\), correct.  \n- \\(2 \\times 100 \\times 9 = 1800\\), correct.  \n- \\(9^2 = 81\\), correct.  \n- Subtracting \\(1800\\) from \\(10000\\) gives \\(8200\\), adding \\(81\\) gives \\(8281\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth strategies yield the same result: \\(8281\\). This consistency suggests that the calculation is likely correct.\n\n**Aha Moment:**  \nUsing different approaches confirms the answer. Whether I applied the binomial formula for addition or subtraction, I arrived at the same result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Result with a Quick Check**\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet me perform a sanity check:  \n- Since \\(90^2 = 8100\\) and adding a bit more (\\(91^2\\) should be more than \\(8100\\)), \\(8281\\) seems reasonable.\n- Also, \\(91\\) is close to \\(100\\), and squaring numbers close to \\(100\\) generally yields results in the low \\(8000s\\).\n\n**Natural Reflection:**  \nThis quick check aligns with the expected range, making \\(8281\\) plausible.\n\n**Moment of Doubt:**  \nIs \\(8281\\) too close to \\(8100\\)? But considering the additional \\(180 + 1 = 181\\) added to \\(8100\\), it makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the calculations, the most consistent and logical result is:\n\n\\[\n91^2 = 8281\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**  \n- All calculations align across multiple methods.\n- The result makes sense both mathematically and within the expected range for \\(91^2\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, applying the binomial squaring formula, checking consistency with an alternative approach, and performing quick checks along the way, I've confidently determined that \\(91^2 = 8281\\). This step-by-step exploration ensured that potential mistakes were caught early and validated the correctness of the final answer.",
