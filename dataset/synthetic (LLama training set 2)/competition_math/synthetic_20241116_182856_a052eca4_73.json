    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and maybe even hitting a few roadblocks along the way.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, I see the question is to convert \\( 3206_7 \\) to a base 10 integer. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like converting a number from base 7 to base 10. I've done similar problems before, so I think I have a rough idea of how to approach it.\n- **Memory Jog:** When converting bases, each digit's position represents a power of the base. So, I need to use powers of 7 here.\n\n**Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure if I remember the exact method or if there's a different strategy that might be easier. Let's brainstorm a bit.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Conversion Using Powers of 7:** This is the standard method I remember\u2014multiplying each digit by 7 raised to its position power.\n   \n2. **Repeated Addition Method:** Maybe adding up the values step by step, though I think this might be more tedious.\n\n3. **Using a Base Conversion Formula:** There might be a formula or shortcut I'm not recalling at the moment.\n\n**Reflection:** The direct conversion method seems the most straightforward and reliable. The repeated addition might take too long, and formulas are not coming to mind right now.\n\n### **Step 2: Planning the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Approach Selection:** I'll go with the direct conversion method, multiplying each digit by the appropriate power of 7.\n- **Positioning:** I'll write down the place values from right to left, starting with \\( 7^0 \\).\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because each position's power of 7 will correctly weight the digits for base 10 conversion.\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up the Calculation**\n\n**Defining Place Values:**\n\nLet's break down \\( 3206_7 \\) by its digits and their respective positions:\n\n- **Thousands place:** \\( 3 \\times 7^3 \\)\n- **Hundreds place:** \\( 2 \\times 7^2 \\)\n- **Tens place:** \\( 0 \\times 7^1 \\)\n- **Units place:** \\( 6 \\times 7^0 \\)\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n\n\\[ \n3 \\times 7^3 + 2 \\times 7^2 + 0 \\times 7^1 + 6 \\times 7^0 \n\\]\n\n**Check:** Ready to calculate. But let me confirm: each digit's position corresponds correctly to the powers of 7? Yes, this aligns with base conversion rules.\n\n### **Step 4: Performing the Calculations**\n\n**Calculating Each Term:**\n\n1. **\\( 3 \\times 7^3 \\):**\n   - \\( 7^3 = 343 \\)\n   - \\( 3 \\times 343 = 1029 \\)\n\n   **Check:** \\( 3 \\times 343 = 1029 \\). This seems correct.\n\n2. **\\( 2 \\times 7^2 \\):**\n   - \\( 7^2 = 49 \\)\n   - \\( 2 \\times 49 = 98 \\)\n\n   **Check:** \\( 2 \\times 49 = 98 \\). Looks good.\n\n3. **\\( 0 \\times 7^1 \\):**\n   - Any number multiplied by zero is zero.\n   - \\( 0 \\times 7 = 0 \\)\n\n   **Check:** This makes sense; zero times anything is zero.\n\n4. **\\( 6 \\times 7^0 \\):**\n   - \\( 7^0 = 1 \\)\n   - \\( 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\)\n\n   **Check:** \\( 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\). Correct.\n\n**Reflection:** All individual calculations seem accurate. Let\u2019s move to the next step.\n\n### **Step 5: Summing Up the Values**\n\n**Adding the Results Together:**\n\n\\[ \n1029 + 98 + 0 + 6 = 1133 \n\\]\n\n**Check:** Let me double-check the addition:\n\n- \\( 1029 + 98 = 1127 \\)\n- \\( 1127 + 0 = 1127 \\)\n- \\( 1127 + 6 = 1133 \\)\n\n**Final Reflection:** The sum adds up correctly. So, \\( 3206_7 \\) converts to **1133 in base 10**.\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Answer**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does 1133 seem reasonable?** Given that \\( 3206_7 \\) has a '3' in the thousands place (base 7), the base 10 equivalent should be over a thousand. So, 1133 makes sense.\n\n**Deeper Check:**\n\n- **Revisiting Each Calculation:** All individual multiplications and the final addition were correct.\n- **Alternative Method Check:** Could I have arrived at this differently? Maybe by breaking it down into smaller chunks, but the direct method was straightforward and accurate.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** The answer is consistent with the expected range and all calculations align correctly.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully breaking down each digit of \\( 3206_7 \\) and converting it to base 10 using powers of 7, the base 10 equivalent is **1133**. Throughout the process, I checked each step to ensure accuracy, reflecting and adjusting my approach as needed to confirm the final answer.",
