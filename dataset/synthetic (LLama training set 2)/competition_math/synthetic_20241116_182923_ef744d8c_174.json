    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem just like I would if I were solving it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, I see that Mark and Sandy are trying to meet at the midpoint between their coordinates. They\u2019re both moving to this midpoint, so it's essentially finding the average of their coordinates.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n\n- **Midpoint Formula:** I remember there's a standard formula for finding the midpoint between two points in a coordinate plane. It involves averaging the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates separately.\n  \n- **Graphical Representation:** Maybe sketching a diagram could help visualize where they are and where they meet.\n\n- **Checking Coordinate Calculations:** I should ensure that I'm correctly calculating the average, especially since negative coordinates are involved.\n\nBut before jumping into calculations, I want to make sure I fully understand the concept of a midpoint. The midpoint is essentially the point that is exactly halfway between two given points.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Using the Midpoint Formula:**\n   - Formula: \\((x_m, y_m) = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\\)\n   - This seems straightforward. Plug in Mark\u2019s and Sandy\u2019s coordinates.\n\n2. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Plotting both points on a graph to visually identify the midpoint.\n   - This might help validate the calculation.\n\n3. **Checking with Distances:**\n   - Calculate the distance between Mark and Sandy to ensure the midpoint is correctly positioned.\n   - However, this might be unnecessary if I only need the midpoint.\n\nI think starting with the **Midpoint Formula** is the most direct approach. If that doesn't work out, I can consider plotting or checking distances.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Midpoint Formula**\n\n**Coordinates:**\n\n- Mark: \\((0, 7)\\)\n- Sandy: \\((-4, -1)\\)\n\n**Formula:**\n\n\\[\n(x_m, y_m) = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **x-coordinate:**\n\n   \\[\n   x_m = \\frac{0 + (-4)}{2} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2\n   \\]\n\n2. **y-coordinate:**\n\n   \\[\n   y_m = \\frac{7 + (-1)}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n\n**Midpoint:**\n\n\\((x_m, y_m) = (-2, 3)\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Just averaging the coordinates separately. But let me check if this aligns with my understanding of midpoints. A midpoint should be equidistant from both points, and averaging their coordinates intuitively makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verification by Graphical Representation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEven though I\u2019m confident in the calculations, sketching might help visualize it better. Let\u2019s see if the midpoint visually makes sense.\n\n**Actions:**\n\n- Plot Mark\u2019s and Sandy\u2019s coordinates on a grid.\n- Draw a line connecting the two points.\n- Identify the point that divides this line segment in half.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, I don\u2019t have a grid here, but I can still think about it. The x-coordinate is -2, and the y-coordinate is 3. Since both points have negative x\u2019s and positive y\u2019s, the midpoint being at (-2, 3) seems reasonable.\n\nBut without a visual, it's harder to be certain. Maybe I should try a different strategy to double-check.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Double-Checking with Distance Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAnother way to ensure the midpoint is correct is to calculate the distance from the midpoint to each point. Both distances should be equal since it's the midpoint.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Distance from Midpoint to Mark:**\n\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(x_m - x_1)^2 + (y_m - y_1)^2} = \\sqrt{(-2 - 0)^2 + (3 - 7)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 16} = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distance from Midpoint to Sandy:**\n\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(x_m - x_2)^2 + (y_m - y_2)^2} = \\sqrt{(-2 - (-4))^2 + (3 - (-1))^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 16} = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth distances are equal (\\(2\\sqrt{5}\\)), which confirms that the midpoint is correctly calculated. This aligns with the definition of a midpoint being equidistant from both endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\nAfter applying the midpoint formula, visualizing the problem conceptually, and verifying with distance calculations, I\u2019m confident that the midpoint is correctly determined.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nMark and Sandy will meet at the coordinate **\\((-2, 3)\\)**.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Calculation Consistency:** All arithmetic checks out.\n- **Conceptual Understanding:** The midpoint concept is correctly applied.\n- **Verification:** Equal distances confirm the correctness.\n\nEverything seems aligned, and the approach worked seamlessly. I\u2019m satisfied with the solution.",
