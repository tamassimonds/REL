    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process as naturally and thoroughly as possible, reflecting and brainstorming along the way, just like I would if I were solving it on my own.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\((2008 + x)^2 = x^2\\), my initial reaction is that it looks like a quadratic equation involving squares. Quadratic equations often come up in algebra, and I remember dealing with similar ones before.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Expand Both Sides:** I could expand \\((2008 + x)^2\\) and bring everything to one side to set the equation to zero. This would give me a standard quadratic form to work with.\n\n2. **Use the Difference of Squares:** Recognizing that the equation involves squares on both sides, perhaps applying the difference of squares formula might simplify things.\n\n3. **Isolate \\(x\\):** Maybe I could try to isolate \\(x\\) by rearranging the equation to see if that leads me directly to the solution.\n\n**Reflection:** Expanding seems straightforward, but maybe there's a quicker way using the difference of squares. I remember that\u2019s a useful trick when dealing with equations set equal to each other involving squares. Let me explore that first.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Applying the Difference of Squares**\n\nWait, let me think this through. The difference of squares formula states that \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\). Our equation is \\((2008 + x)^2 = x^2\\), so I can rearrange it to fit this form.\n\n**Rearranging the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n(2008 + x)^2 - x^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Now it resembles the difference of squares formula, where \\(a = 2008 + x\\) and \\(b = x\\). So, according to the formula:\n\n\\[\n(2008 + x - x)(2008 + x + x) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(2008)(2008 + 2x) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Wait, does this make sense? Multiplying \\(2008\\) by \\((2008 + 2x)\\) doesn't immediately help me solve for \\(x\\). Perhaps I made an error in applying the formula. Let's reconsider.\n\n**Reflection:** The correct application of the difference of squares should lead to factors that equal zero. However, it seems I overlooked the steps. Let me re-apply the difference of squares more carefully.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Correcting the Approach Using Difference of Squares**\n\nLet's take a step back. The correct difference of squares application should be:\n\n\\[\n(2008 + x)^2 - x^2 = [(2008 + x) - x][(2008 + x) + x] = [2008][2008 + 2x] = 0\n\\]\n\nBut this leads to:\n\n\\[\n2008 \\times (2008 + 2x) = 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\(2008\\) is not zero, we can divide both sides by \\(2008\\):\n\n\\[\n2008 + 2x = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This simplifies the equation nicely. Now, I can solve for \\(x\\) without any unnecessary complexity. Checking if the steps align:\n\n1. \\((2008 + x)^2 - x^2 = 0\\)\n2. Applying difference of squares: \\((2008 + x - x)(2008 + x + x) = (2008)(2008 + 2x) = 0\\)\n3. Dividing by \\(2008\\): \\(2008 + 2x = 0\\)\n\nThis seems correct. Let's proceed to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Solving the Simplified Equation**\n\nNow, I have:\n\n\\[\n2008 + 2x = 0\n\\]\n\n**Isolating \\(x\\):**\n\n\\[\n2x = -2008\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-2008}{2} = -1004\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Multiplying \\(-1004\\) by \\(2\\) gives \\(-2008\\), and adding \\(2008\\) confirms the equation balances:\n\n\\[\n2008 + 2(-1004) = 2008 - 2008 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis checks out perfectly.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThinking about it, initially attempting to apply the difference of squares led me to a more complicated path. However, recognizing where the application was off and correcting it streamlined the process. This approach made it straightforward to isolate \\(x\\) and arrive at the correct solution quickly.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:** \n\nIf applying the difference of squares hadn\u2019t worked, I could have expanded \\((2008 + x)^2\\) and set the equation to zero to get a standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n2008^2 + 2 \\times 2008 \\times x + x^2 - x^2 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2008^2 + 4016x = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n4016x = -2008^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-2008^2}{4016}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this would be more tedious than the path I took, reaffirming that the difference of squares, when applied correctly, is an efficient method here.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies and reflecting on each step, I was able to navigate through initial confusion and arrive at the correct solution. Checking each part of the process ensured accuracy, and being open to adjusting the approach helped streamline solving the problem.\n\nThe value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the equation \\((2008 + x)^2 = x^2\\) is **\\(-1004\\)**.",
