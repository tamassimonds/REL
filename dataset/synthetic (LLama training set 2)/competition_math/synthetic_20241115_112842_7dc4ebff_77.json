    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll try to capture my initial thoughts, brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check if I'm on the right track \u2013 just like I would if I were solving this manually.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, it reminds me of those colorful combinatorial puzzles I\u2019ve seen before, especially dealing with grids and symmetries. My immediate reaction is to think about different ways to count the colorings, considering rotations make some look the same.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. The fact that colorings are considered the same under rotation adds complexity. I recall some combinatorial principles might apply here, like using combinatorial counting or considering symmetries.\n\nI also wonder if drawing out some examples might help me visualize the problem better. Maybe creating small cases (like a $1\\times 1$ or $2\\times 2$ board with different colors) could give me insights.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Total Colorings Without Considering Rotations:**\n   - Calculate the total number of ways to color the board without considering rotations. This would be \\(5^4\\) since each square can be any of the 5 colors.\n\n2. **Considering Rotations:**\n   - Use Burnside's Lemma, a combinatorial tool that helps account for symmetries, to find the number of distinct colorings considering rotations.\n\n3. **Manual Enumeration:**\n   - Try enumerating different cases manually to ensure my calculations make sense.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Board:**\n   - Perhaps simplify the board by fixing one square's color and see how it affects the rest, reducing the complexity.\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Total Colorings Without Considering Rotations**\n\nLet's start by calculating the total number of colorings without considering the rotations.\n\n- **Number of Squares:** 4\n- **Number of Colors:** 5\n\nSo, the total number of ways to color the board is:\n\n\\[\n5^4 = 625\n\\]\n\nAt this point, it feels straightforward. But I recall that this number includes colorings that are identical under rotation. So, we can't use this directly as the final answer.\n\n### **Reflection: Is This Approach Correct?**\n\nThinking about it, while \\(625\\) represents all possible colorings, it doesn't account for the fact that some of these colorings are indistinguishable because the board can be rotated. So, this number is too high for our objective.\n\n### **Deciding to Proceed with Burnside's Lemma**\n\nSince the total colorings include duplicates due to rotations, my next step is to consider Burnside's Lemma. This should help in accurately counting the distinct colorings by considering the board's symmetries.\n\nBurnside's Lemma states:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of distinct colorings} = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} |\\text{Fix}(g)|\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(|G|\\) is the number of symmetries (group size),\n- \\(\\text{Fix}(g)\\) is the number of colorings fixed by symmetry \\(g\\).\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Symmetry Group \\(|G|\\)**\n\nFor a \\(2\\times 2\\) board, the symmetry group includes:\n1. **Identity Rotation (0\u00b0):** The board remains unchanged.\n2. **90\u00b0 Rotation Clockwise:** The board rotates a quarter turn.\n3. **180\u00b0 Rotation Clockwise:** The board rotates halfway.\n4. **270\u00b0 Rotation Clockwise:** The board rotates three-quarters turn.\n\nTotal symmetries: **4**.\n\nSo, \\(|G| = 4\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate \\(|\\text{Fix}(g)|\\) for Each Symmetry**\n\nLet's consider each symmetry and determine how many colorings remain unchanged.\n\n1. **Identity Rotation (0\u00b0):**\n   - All colorings remain unchanged.\n   - \\(|\\text{Fix}(\\text{id})| = 5^4 = 625\\).\n\n   *Thoughts:* This makes sense because the identity symmetry affects no squares.\n\n2. **90\u00b0 Rotation Clockwise:**\n   - Each square moves to a different position: \n     - Top-left \u2194 Top-right \u2194 Bottom-right \u2194 Bottom-left.\n   - For the coloring to remain unchanged, all four squares must be the same color.\n   - \\(|\\text{Fix}(\\text{90\u00b0})| = 5\\) (one for each color).\n\n   *Reflection:* Since all squares must be the same to be invariant under this rotation, there are only 5 valid colorings.\n\n3. **180\u00b0 Rotation Clockwise:**\n   - The top-left swaps with the bottom-right, and the top-right swaps with the bottom-left.\n   - The coloring remains unchanged if:\n     - Top-left = Bottom-right,\n     - Top-right = Bottom-left.\n   - Each pair can independently choose one of the 5 colors.\n   - \\(|\\text{Fix}(\\text{180\u00b0})| = 5 \\times 5 = 25\\).\n\n   *Check:* Two independent pairs can each be one of 5 colors.\n\n4. **270\u00b0 Rotation Clockwise:**\n   - Similar to the 90\u00b0 rotation, but in the opposite direction.\n   - Again, all four squares must be the same color.\n   - \\(|\\text{Fix}(\\text{270\u00b0})| = 5\\).\n\n   *Thoughts:* This is analogous to the 90\u00b0 rotation case.\n\n### **Step 3: Sum Up \\(|\\text{Fix}(g)|\\)**\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{g \\in G} |\\text{Fix}(g)| = 625 + 5 + 25 + 5 = 660\n\\]\n\n### **Step 4: Apply Burnside's Lemma**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of distinct colorings} = \\frac{1}{|G|} = \\frac{660}{4} = 165\n\\]\n\n### **Final Reflection: Is This Answer Reasonable?**\n\nLet's think this through. The number \\(165\\) represents the distinct ways to color the \\(2\\times 2\\) board considering rotations as identical. \n\n- **Comparison with Total Colorings:** \n  - Without considering rotations, there were \\(625\\) colorings.\n  - With symmetries accounted for, the number reduces to \\(165\\), which seems reasonable since many colorings are indeed identical under rotation.\n\n- **Verification with Simple Cases:**\n  - For a \\(1\\times 1\\) board (just a single square), clearly, only one way to color it regardless of rotation: \\(5\\) distinct colorings.\n  - For a \\(2\\times 2\\) board with all squares the same color, only \\(5\\) colorings exist, matching our \\(90\u00b0\\) and \\(270\u00b0\\) rotation cases.\n  - The \\(180\u00b0\\) rotation allowing \\(25\\) colorings also aligns with this reasoning.\n\nEverything checks out. The approach seems correct, and the final answer makes sense given the problem's constraints.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and carefully applying Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct ways to color the four unit squares of a \\(2\\times 2\\) board, considering rotations as identical, is **165**.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration mimics a human thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed!",

  "ground_truth": "We'll start with the naive estimate that there are $5^4=625$ colorings, since there are 5 choices for the color of each square. Obviously, some colorings will be counted more than once. Consider a general coloring and the three other colorings obtained by rotating it. If all four squares are the same color, in 5 of the 625 colorings, we get the same thing when we rotate it, so these are not overcounted. If opposite squares match but adjacent ones do not, then we get two colorings that should be counted together, so we are double-counting these $5\\cdot4=20$ colorings (there are 5 choices for one color and 4 for the other color). In the other $5^4-5-20=600$ cases, we quadruple-count the colorings, since there are four of the original colorings that are really the same. Therefore, the total number of distinct colorings is $$5+\\frac{20}2+\\frac{600}4=5+10+150=\\boxed{165}.$$[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle); draw((.5,1)--(.5,0)); draw((.5,1)--(.5,1));\ndraw((2,0)--(3,0)--(3,1)--(2,1)--cycle); draw((2.5,1)--(2.5,0)); draw((2.5,1)--(2.5,0));\ndraw((4,0)--(5,0)--(5,1)--(4,1)--cycle); draw((4.5,1)--(4.5,0)); draw((4.5,1)--(4.5,0));\nfill((0,0)--(.5,0)--(.5,.5)--(0,.5)--cycle,red);\nfill((.5,0)--(1,0)--(1,.5)--(.5,.5)--cycle,red);\nfill((.5,.5)--(1,.5)--(1,1)--(.5,1)--cycle,red);\nfill((0,.5)--(.5,.5)--(.5,1)--(0,1)--cycle,red);\nfill((2,0)--(2.5,0)--(2.5,.5)--(2,.5)--cycle,red);\nfill((2.5,0)--(3,0)--(3,.5)--(2.5,.5)--cycle,blue);\nfill((2.5,.5)--(3,.5)--(3,1)--(2.5,1)--cycle,red);\nfill((2,.5)--(2.5,.5)--(2.5,1)--(2,1)--cycle,blue);\nfill((4,0)--(4.5,0)--(4.5,.5)--(4,.5)--cycle,blue);\nfill((4.5,0)--(5,0)--(5,.5)--(4.5,.5)--cycle,red);\nfill((4.5,.5)--(5,.5)--(5,1)--(4.5,1)--cycle,blue);\nfill((4,.5)--(4.5,.5)--(4.5,1)--(4,1)--cycle,yellow);\nlabel(\"5\",(.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"20\",(2.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"600\",(4.5,0),S);\n[/asy]"
