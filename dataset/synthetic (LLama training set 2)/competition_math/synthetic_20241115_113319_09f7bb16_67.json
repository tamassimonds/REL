    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where it takes us. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies and reflecting often to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, **\"Melanie ran at 5 m/s for 400 meters, then at 4 m/s for 800 meters, and finally at 8 m/s for 400 meters. What was her average speed in meters per second for the 1600 meter run?\"** I think, \"This looks like a problem involving average speed, which I remember from physics classes.\"\n\nMy initial reaction is to recall the formula for average speed. But then I wonder, \"Wait, since she's running at different speeds over different distances, maybe I need to consider each segment individually.\"\n\n**Reflection:** Averaging speeds directly won't work here because average speed depends on total distance and total time. I need to calculate the time taken for each segment and then find the overall average speed.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate the time for each segment:**\n   - Use the formula \\( \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\).\n   - Sum these times to find the total time.\n\n2. **Use total distance and total time to find average speed:**\n   - Average speed \\( = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} \\).\n\n3. **Check if there's a quicker way by looking for patterns:**\n   - Maybe the distances at different speeds can simplify calculations.\n   - But initially, it seems straightforward to calculate each segment separately.\n\n**Reflection:** The first two strategies make the most sense. The third one, looking for patterns, might complicate things since the speeds and distances don't follow a simple ratio.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Time for Each Segment**\n\nLet's start with the **first segment**:\n- Distance: 400 meters\n- Speed: 5 m/s\n\nThinking aloud: \"Okay, should be straightforward. Let me plug these numbers into the formula.\"\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_1 = \\frac{400 \\text{ meters}}{5 \\text{ m/s}} = 80 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** \\( 400 \\div 5 = 80 \\). That seems right.\n\n**Reflection:** The calculation feels correct. Let's move on to the next segment.\n\n**Second Segment:**\n- Distance: 800 meters\n- Speed: 4 m/s\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_2 = \\frac{800 \\text{ meters}}{4 \\text{ m/s}} = 200 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** \\( 800 \\div 4 = 200 \\). Okay, this also checks out.\n\n**Reflection:** Both segment times make sense. Now, onto the final segment.\n\n**Third Segment:**\n- Distance: 400 meters\n- Speed: 8 m/s\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_3 = \\frac{400 \\text{ meters}}{8 \\text{ m/s}} = 50 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** \\( 400 \\div 8 = 50 \\). Looks good.\n\n**Reflection:** All three segments' times add up correctly. I feel confident about these calculations.\n\n### **Step 2: Sum the Total Time**\n\nNow, let's find the **total time** taken for the entire run:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\text{Time}_1 + \\text{Time}_2 + \\text{Time}_3 = 80 + 200 + 50 = 330 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** \\( 80 + 200 = 280 \\); \\( 280 + 50 = 330 \\). That adds up correctly.\n\n**Reflection:** The total time seems reasonable. Now, let's proceed to calculate the average speed.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate Average Speed**\n\nWith the total distance and total time known, I can find the **average speed**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{1600 \\text{ meters}}{330 \\text{ seconds}}\n\\]\n\nThinking: \"Hmm, this fraction looks like it can be simplified. But let's calculate it first.\"\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{1600}{330} \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\nNow, simplify the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{1600 \\div 10}{330 \\div 10} = \\frac{160}{33} \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Does \\( \\frac{160}{33} \\) make sense? Let's see:\n\n- Divide 160 by 33: \\( 160 \\div 33 \\approx 4.85 \\).\n- **Does this seem reasonable?** Given that the slowest speed was 4 m/s and the fastest was 8 m/s, an average of approximately 4.85 m/s makes sense because the majority of the distance was covered at 4 m/s.\n\n**Reflection:** The average speed calculation feels correct. The fraction simplifies nicely, and the value aligns with the expected range based on the segment speeds.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Weighted Average Speed**\n\n**Thought Process:** I remember another method for calculating average speed when dealing with multiple segments: using a weighted average based on distance. Let me see if this aligns with our previous calculation.\n\n**Weighted Average Formula:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{(v_1 \\times d_1) + (v_2 \\times d_2) + (v_3 \\times d_3)}{d_1 + d_2 + d_3}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( v_1, v_2, v_3 \\) are the speeds\n- \\( d_1, d_2, d_3 \\) are the distances\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{(5 \\times 400) + (4 \\times 800) + (8 \\times 400)}{400 + 800 + 400} = \\frac{2000 + 3200 + 3200}{1600} = \\frac{8400}{1600} = \\frac{84}{16} = \\frac{21}{4} = 5.25 \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, this doesn't match our previous result of \\( \\frac{160}{33} \\) m/s. Let me check the calculations.\n\n**Checking Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(5 \\times 400) = 2000\n\\]\n\\[\n(4 \\times 800) = 3200\n\\]\n\\[\n(8 \\times 400) = 3200\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of products} = 2000 + 3200 + 3200 = 8400\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = 400 + 800 + 400 = 1600\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{8400}{1600} = 5.25 \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, the weighted average method gives an average speed of 5.25 m/s. However, our initial method gave \\( \\frac{160}{33} \\approx 4.85 \\) m/s.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:** This discrepancy makes me pause. The weighted average approach seems more straightforward and should ideally align with the total time method. Let me re-examine my initial steps.\n\n### **Re-examining the Initial Approach**\n\n**Step 1:** Calculated the time for each segment correctly.\n\n**Step 2:** Summed the total time accurately.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculated the average speed as \\( \\frac{1600}{330} = \\frac{160}{33} \\) m/s.\n\n**Check:** \\( \\frac{160}{33} \\approx 4.85 \\) m/s, which is lower than 5.25 m/s.\n\n**Reflection:** **Hmm, wait a minute.** The average speed based on weighted distances should account for the slower and faster segments proportionally. Since a larger portion of the distance was covered at 4 m/s, the average speed being lower makes sense. \n\n**Conclusion:** The initial method was correct. The weighted average approach seems to have introduced an error.\n\n**Final Check:** Let's see if simplifying \\( \\frac{160}{33} \\) m/s aligns with a decimal conversion.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{160}{33} \\approx 4.848 \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This value aligns closely with the average speed we calculated earlier. Given that the total distance was primarily covered at 4 m/s, and shorter distances were at higher speeds, an average speed around 4.85 m/s makes sense.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nSo, after exploring different strategies and verifying calculations, **Melanie's average speed for the 1600 meter run was**:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{160}{33} \\text{ m/s}}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:** It's important to cross-check different methods to ensure accuracy. Initially, the weighted average method suggested a higher average speed, but upon reviewing the total time approach, which accounted for each segment's contribution accurately, the average speed was correctly identified as \\( \\frac{160}{33} \\) m/s.\n\nBy brainstorming, reflecting frequently, and re-examining different strategies, I ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The average speed is the total distance traveled, namely $1600\\ \\text{m}$, divided by the total time of the run. It took Melanie $\\frac{400}{5}=80$ seconds to run the first $400$ meters, $\\frac{800}{4}=200$ seconds to run the next $800$ meters, and $\\frac{400}{8}=50$ seconds to run the final $400$ meters.
