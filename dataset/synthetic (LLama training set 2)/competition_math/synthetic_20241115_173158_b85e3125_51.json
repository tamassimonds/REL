    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, thinking through it just like how I'd approach it naturally. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's start by thoroughly understanding what's being asked.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, my brain immediately recognizes the function \\( y = a \\sin(bx + c) + d \\). This looks like a **sine wave**, which is a periodic function. I remember that the parameters \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) each play specific roles in transforming the basic sine function.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** \n  - **Amplitude (\\( a \\)):** Controls the height of the wave.\n  - **Frequency (\\( b \\)):** Affects how many cycles occur in a given interval.\n  - **Phase Shift (\\( c \\)):** Shifts the graph left or right.\n  - **Vertical Shift (\\( d \\)):** Moves the graph up or down.\n\nGiven that the question asks for **\\( a \\)**, the **amplitude**, I need to focus on how \\( a \\) affects the graph's peaks and troughs.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Look at the Graph:** Perhaps I can determine the amplitude by examining the maximum and minimum values of the graph.\n   \n2. **Check the General Form:** Recalling the characteristics of sine functions might help relate their parameters to the graph's features.\n\n3. **Use Specific Points:** If specific points on the graph are provided, I could plug them into the equation to set up equations involving \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\).\n\n### **Step 1: Examining the Graph**\n\nLet me start with the first strategy: **looking at the graph** to find the amplitude.\n\n- **Observation:** The graph oscillates between two horizontal lines. Let me pinpoint those maximum and minimum values.\n\n- **Maximum Value:** Looks like the highest point is at \\( y = 3 \\).\n- **Minimum Value:** The lowest point is at \\( y = -1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute, if the amplitude is the distance from the midline to the peak, I need to determine the vertical shift (\\( d \\)) first. The amplitude (\\( a \\)) is half the distance between the maximum and minimum values.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amplitude} (\\( a \\)) = \\frac{\\text{Maximum} - \\text{Minimum}}{2} = \\frac{3 - (-1)}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, the amplitude is 2, meaning the wave oscillates 2 units above and below its midline.\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Vertical Shift (\\( d \\))**\n\nNow, to confirm our amplitude calculation, let's find the **vertical shift (\\( d \\))**, which is the midpoint between the maximum and minimum values.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{\\text{Maximum} + \\text{Minimum}}{2} = \\frac{3 + (-1)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the midline of the sine wave is at \\( y = 1 \\). This makes sense because the wave oscillates 2 units above and below this line.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Midline: \\( y = 1 \\)\n- Maximum: \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n- Minimum: \\( 1 - 2 = -1 \\)\n\nEverything checks out so far.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Amplitude with the Midline**\n\nLet's double-check that the amplitude \\( a = 2 \\) aligns with the midline \\( d = 1 \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf the sine wave is centered around \\( y = 1 \\) and has an amplitude of 2, then:\n\n- The peak should be at \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\).\n- The trough should be at \\( 1 - 2 = -1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis matches the observed maximum and minimum values on the graph. So, our calculations are consistent.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Cross-Checking Using Sine Properties**\n\nTo ensure our approach is correct, let's use another strategy: **considering the properties of the sine function.**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- The **amplitude** (\\( a \\)) is always the distance from the midline to the peak.\n- Given the midline (\\( d \\)) is at \\( y = 1 \\) and the peak is at \\( y = 3 \\), the amplitude should indeed be \\( 2 = 3 - 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis reaffirms our initial calculation. The amplitude \\( a = 2 \\) is consistent with both the graph's observations and the properties of the sine function.\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Consistency with the Sine Function**\n\nLet's wrap up by making sure our value for \\( a \\) fits within the general form of the sine function.\n\n- **General Form:** \\( y = a \\sin(bx + c) + d \\)\n- **Given:** \n  - Amplitude (\\( a \\)): 2\n  - Vertical Shift (\\( d \\)): 1\n  - Maximum: \\( d + a = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n  - Minimum: \\( d - a = 1 - 2 = -1 \\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Calculculated Maximum: \\( 3 \\) \u2713\n- Calculated Minimum: \\( -1 \\) \u2713\n\nEverything aligns perfectly.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies and cross-checking our calculations:\n\n- The **amplitude \\( a \\)** is **2**.\n- This is consistent with the maximum and minimum values observed on the graph.\n- The vertical shift \\( d \\) is **1**, centering the sine wave around \\( y = 1 \\).\n- All checks confirm the correctness of the amplitude value.\n\nSo, the final answer is **\\( a = 2 \\)**.",
