I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach makes sense, check my work often, and adjust my methods as needed\u2014all while trying to think as naturally as possible, similar to how I would tackle the problem in real life.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, *\"What is the intersection point of the line \\(y = 2x + 5\\) and the line perpendicular to it that passes through the point \\((5, 5)\\)?\"*, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Understand the Components:** There are two lines involved:\n   - A given line: \\(y = 2x + 5\\)\n   - A perpendicular line passing through \\((5, 5)\\)\n\n2. **Intersection Point:** I need to find where these two lines intersect.\n\n3. **Perpendicular Lines:** I recall that when two lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is \\(-1\\).\n\nThis reminds me of problems involving finding intersection points of two lines, especially when one line is perpendicular to another. My initial instinct is to determine the slope of the perpendicular line and then use that to find its equation.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nLet's brainstorm different strategies to tackle this:\n\n1. **Find the Slope of the Perpendicular Line:**\n   - Calculate the slope that is perpendicular to the given line by using the negative reciprocal.\n\n2. **Determine the Equation of the Perpendicular Line:**\n   - Use the point \\((5, 5)\\) to find the equation of the perpendicular line.\n\n3. **Solve for the Intersection Point:**\n   - Set the two equations equal to each other to find the intersection point.\n\n4. **Check the Solution:**\n   - Verify if the point satisfies both line equations.\n\nDoes this approach make sense? Let's see.\n\n### **Step 1: Find the Slope of the Given Line**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The given line is \\(y = 2x + 5\\).\n- This is in slope-intercept form (\\(y = mx + b\\)), where \\(m\\) is the slope.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Slope (\\(m\\)) of the Given Line:** \\(m = 2\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Okay, so the slope of the given line is \\(2\\). To find the slope of the perpendicular line, I need the negative reciprocal of \\(2\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Slope of the Perpendicular Line**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The slope of the perpendicular line (\\(m_{\\perpendicular}\\)) should satisfy the condition \\(m \\times m_{\\perpendicular} = -1\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- \\(2 \\times m_{\\perpendicular} = -1\\)\n- Solving for \\(m_{\\perpendicular}\\):  \n  \\[\n  m_{\\perpendicular} = \\frac{-1}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The slope of the perpendicular line is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\). That makes sense because it's the negative reciprocal of \\(2\\).\n\n### **Step 3: Find the Equation of the Perpendicular Line**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, I need the equation of the line with slope \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) that passes through \\((5, 5)\\).\n- I can use the point-slope form of a line:  \n  \\[\n  y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n  \\]  \n  where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is the given point and \\(m\\) is the slope.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Plugging in the values:  \n  \\[\n  y - 5 = -\\frac{1}{2}(x - 5)\n  \\]\n- Distributing:  \n  \\[\n  y - 5 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{5}{2}\n  \\]\n- Adding \\(5\\) to both sides:  \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{10}{2}\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{15}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, the equation of the perpendicular line is \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{15}{2}\\). This looks good because the slope matches \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), and it passes through \\((5, 5)\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Solve for the Intersection Point**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find the intersection point, I need to set the two equations equal to each other since, at the intersection, both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates satisfy both line equations.\n\n**Equation Set-Up:**\n\\[\n2x + 5 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{15}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Combine Like Terms:**\n  - Add \\(\\frac{1}{2}x\\) to both sides:  \n    \\[\n    2x + \\frac{1}{2}x + 5 = \\frac{15}{2}\n    \\]\n  - Simplify \\(2x + \\frac{1}{2}x\\):  \n    \\[\n    \\frac{5}{2}x + 5 = \\frac{15}{2}\n    \\]\n  - Subtract \\(5\\) from both sides:  \n    \\[\n    \\frac{5}{2}x = \\frac{15}{2} - 5\n    \\]\n  - Convert \\(5\\) to halves:  \n    \\[\n    \\frac{5}{2}x = \\frac{15}{2} - \\frac{10}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}\n    \\]\n  - **Solve for \\(x\\):**  \n    \\[\n    x = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2}}{\\frac{5}{2}} = 1\n    \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, let me double-check this. The calculations seem correct, but let me verify by plugging \\(x = 1\\) back into both line equations.\n\n### **Step 5: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I should check if \\(x = 1\\) and the corresponding \\(y\\) value satisfy both line equations.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **For the Given Line:**  \n  \\[\n  y = 2(1) + 5 = 7\n  \\]\n- **For the Perpendicular Line:**  \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{1}{2}(1) + \\frac{15}{2} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{15}{2} = 7\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both lines yield \\(y = 7\\) when \\(x = 1\\). This confirms that the intersection point is indeed \\((1, 7)\\). Everything checks out!\n\n### **Step 6: Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thought Process:**\n- After exploring different strategies and verifying the calculations, I've determined the intersection point.\n\n**Answer:**\n- The intersection point of the line \\(y = 2x + 5\\) and the line perpendicular to it that passes through \\((5, 5)\\) is \\((1, 7)\\).\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n- Initially, I considered various approaches, settled on finding the perpendicular line's slope, and confirmed the intersection point through calculations and checks. Throughout the process, I made sure to verify each step, ensuring the solution was correct before proceeding. By reflecting and adjusting my methods as needed, I arrived at the accurate intersection point.",

  "ground_truth": "The slope of $y = 2x + 5$ is 2, which means the slope of any line perpendicular to it is $-\\frac 12$.  Using the point-slope equation for a line we can find the equation of the second line to be $y - 5 = -\\frac 12 (x - 5)$.  To find the intersection of this with the first line, we plug $y = 2x + 5$ into the second equation to get $2x + 5 - 5 = - \\frac 12 (x - 5) \\Rightarrow \\frac {5}2 x = \\frac 52 \\Rightarrow x = 1$.  Therefore $y = 2\\cdot 1 + 5 = 7$ making the intersection at $\\boxed{(1, 7)}$."
