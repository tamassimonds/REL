    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by brainstorming and exploring different strategies. We'll tackle it step by step, reflecting and checking along the way to ensure our approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the equation is \\(100^3 = 10^x\\). \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like an exponent problem involving powers of 10. I remember that exponents can be tricky, but there's probably a way to express both sides with the same base.\n  \n- **Thinking Out Loud:** Maybe I can rewrite 100 in terms of 10, since 100 is \\(10^2\\). That might help me set the exponents equal to each other. But let me consider other strategies too, just to be sure.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:**\n  1. **Rewriting 100 in Base 10:** Convert \\(100\\) to \\(10^2\\) and then expand the exponent.\n  2. **Using Logarithms:** Take the logarithm of both sides to bring down the exponents.\n  3. **Numerical Calculation:** Calculate \\(100^3\\) and \\(10^x\\) directly to see if there's a pattern (though this might not be efficient).\n  \n- **Reflecting:** Rewriting in terms of base 10 seems the most straightforward. Logarithms are helpful too, but maybe overkill for this problem. Let's start with converting 100 and see where that leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Rewriting 100 in Base 10**\n\n- **Action:** Express \\(100\\) as \\(10^2\\):\n  \\[\n  100^3 = (10^2)^3\n  \\]\n\n- **Thought Process:** By using the power of a power rule in exponents \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\), I can simplify the left side.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  (10^2)^3 = 10^{2 \\times 3} = 10^6\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because squaring 10 gives 100, and cubing that gives \\(10^6\\). So, the left side is now \\(10^6\\).\n\n- **Reflection:** Now both sides of the equation have the same base (10), which makes it easier to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Exponents Equal**\n\n- **Action:** Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:\n  \\[\n  10^6 = 10^x \\implies 6 = x\n  \\]\n  \n- **Thought Process:** When two exponential expressions with the same base are equal, their exponents must also be equal. This is a fundamental property of exponents.\n\n- **Check:** Does \\(x = 6\\) make sense? If \\(100^3 = 10^6\\), then:\n  \\[\n  100^3 = 1,000,000\n  \\]\n  and\n  \\[\n  10^6 = 1,000,000\n  \\]\n  Both sides are equal, so \\(x = 6\\) is correct.\n\n- **Reflection:** This approach worked well. By converting 100 to a power of 10, I simplified the equation and set the exponents equal, leading directly to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n- **Action:** Double-check the calculations to ensure everything is correct.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - Compute \\(100^3\\):\n    \\[\n    100^3 = 100 \\times 100 \\times 100 = 1,000,000\n    \\]\n  - Compute \\(10^6\\):\n    \\[\n    10^6 = 1,000,000\n    \\]\n    \n- **Check:** Both calculations yield the same result (\\(1,000,000\\)), confirming that \\(x = 6\\) is indeed correct.\n\n- **Reflection:** The solution is consistent across both sides of the original equation. There's no discrepancy, so I can confidently say \\(x = 6\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Using Logarithms**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Even though the first method worked well, let's briefly explore using logarithms to see how it compares.\n\n- **Action:** Take the logarithm of both sides:\n  \\[\n  \\log(100^3) = \\log(10^x)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  - Using logarithm properties:\n    \\[\n    3 \\log(100) = x \\log(10)\n    \\]\n  - Since \\(\\log(10) = 1\\) and \\(\\log(100) = 2\\):\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 2 = x \\times 1 \\implies 6 = x\n    \\]\n    \n- **Check:** This also gives \\(x = 6\\), matching our previous result.\n\n- **Reflection:** Using logarithms is a valid approach and confirms the solution. However, it felt more complex than necessary for this problem. Rewriting in terms of base 10 was more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, the most effective method was to rewrite \\(100\\) as \\(10^2\\) and then apply the power of a power rule to simplify the equation. This led directly to setting the exponents equal and solving for \\(x = 6\\).\n\n- **Final Answer:** \\(x = 6\\)\n\n- **Final Reflection:** Throughout the process, checking each step ensured the correctness of the solution. While alternative methods like using logarithms worked, the initial approach was the simplest and most intuitive, highlighting the importance of starting with foundational concepts in exponent problems.",
