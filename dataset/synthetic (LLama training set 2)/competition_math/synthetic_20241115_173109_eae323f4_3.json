    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking the natural thought process I would go through if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on them, check my progress frequently, and adjust my approach if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question about finding the mode of the scores represented in a stem-and-leaf plot, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Understanding the Stem-and-Leaf Plot**: I remember stem-and-leaf plots from earlier math classes. They organize data by separating each score into a \"stem\" (the leading digit(s)) and a \"leaf\" (the trailing digit). So, for example, \"9 | 6\" represents the score 96.\n\n2. **Mode Definition**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. So, I need to identify which score occurs the most in this plot.\n\n3. **Possible Strategies**:\n   - **List All Scores**: Write down all the scores explicitly to see which one repeats the most.\n   - **Count Frequencies by Row**: Since the plot is organized by stems, maybe counting the leaves in each row could help.\n   - **Visual Inspection**: Just look closely to see which score has the most leaves, though this might be error-prone.\n\nI'm leaning towards **listing all scores** as my first approach because it's straightforward and ensures accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Translating the Stem-and-Leaf Plot**\n\n**Thought Process**: Let's start by writing down all the scores represented in the plot. This will give me a clear picture of the data and help identify the mode.\n\n**Action**: I'll go through each row (stem) and write out the corresponding scores (leaf).\n\n#### **Stem-and-Leaf Plot Recap:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{tabular}{c|lllllll}\n\\multicolumn{8}{c}{\\underline{Points on the Test}}\\\\\n5 &0 & 0 & & & & &\\\\\n6 &3 & & & & & &\\\\\n7 &7 & 8 & & & & &\\\\\n8 &2 & 6 & 7 & 9 & 9 & 9 & 9\\\\\n9 &1 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 6 & &\\\\\n10 & 0 & 0 & 0 & & & &\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\]\n\n#### **Translating Each Stem:**\n\n- **Stem 5**: 50, 50\n- **Stem 6**: 63\n- **Stem 7**: 77, 78\n- **Stem 8**: 82, 86, 87, 89, 89, 89, 89\n- **Stem 9**: 91, 94, 94, 94, 96\n- **Stem 10**: 100, 100, 100\n\n**Reflection**: Wait, did I miss anything? No, I think each leaf corresponds directly to the scores by adding the stem value to the leaf. So, that seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Counting the Frequencies**\n\n**Thought Process**: Now, let's count how many times each score appears. This will help identify the mode.\n\n**Action**: I'll list each unique score and tally their occurrences.\n\n#### **Listing and Counting:**\n\n- 50: 2 times\n- 63: 1 time\n- 77: 1 time\n- 78: 1 time\n- 82: 1 time\n- 86: 1 time\n- 87: 1 time\n- 89: 4 times\n- 91: 1 time\n- 94: 3 times\n- 96: 1 time\n- 100: 3 times\n\n**Checking**:  \n- **Total Scores Listed**: 15 unique scores\n- **Sum of Frequencies**: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 20\n\n**Reflection**: Wait a second... I expected 15 scores total because each score is represented once by its stem and once by its leaf. But I counted 20 frequencies. Hmmm, maybe I need to double-check how I'm counting or if there are duplicates I'm missing.\n\n**Re-evaluation**: Let me re-check the stem-and-leaf plot to see if I'm miscounting.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Re-examining the Stem-and-Leaf Plot**\n\n**Thought Process**: Perhaps I'm miscounting because of duplicate entries. Let\u2019s look closer at the stems with multiple leaves.\n\n**Action**: I'll focus particularly on stems with repeated leaves to ensure I'm counting correctly.\n\n#### **Spotting Duplicates:**\n\n- **Stem 8**: Has four 9s. So, 89 appears four times.\n- **Stem 9**: Has three 4s. So, 94 appears three times.\n- **Stem 10**: Has three 0s. So, 100 appears three times.\n\n**Reflection**: Ah, I see now! I initially counted each instance separately without considering that some scores repeat within the same stem. This explains the discrepancy in the total.\n\n**Adjustment**: I'll now count each unique score's frequency without double-counting.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Correcting the Frequency Count**\n\n**Thought Process**: Let's accurately tally the frequencies, considering duplicates within each stem.\n\n**Action**: I'll list each score only once per stem and adjust the counts accordingly.\n\n#### **Corrected Listing and Counting:**\n\n- **50**: 2 times\n- **63**: 1 time\n- **77**: 1 time\n- **78**: 1 time\n- **82**: 1 time\n- **86**: 1 time\n- **87**: 1 time\n- **89**: 4 times (from Stem 8)\n- **91**: 1 time\n- **94**: 3 times (from Stem 9)\n- **96**: 1 time\n- **100**: 3 times (from Stem 10)\n\n**Checking Again**:  \n- **Total Unique Scores**: 11\n- **Sum of Frequencies**: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\n**Quick Check**: Hmm, the total of accessible frequencies is 11, but I previously had 15 unique scores. Let me re-check if I'm missing something.\n\n**Spotting the Issue**: Looks like I miscounted earlier. Initially, I listed scores directly from leaves without considering duplicates. Now that I've corrected for duplicates, the total makes more sense.\n\n**Re-evaluation**: It's essential to ensure that each score is counted based on how many times it appears within its respective stem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying the Mode**\n\n**Thought Process**: Now that I have the corrected frequency counts, I can easily identify the mode\u2014the score that appears most frequently.\n\n**Action**: I'll look for the highest frequency count among the scores.\n\n#### **Frequency Counts Summary:**\n\n- 50: 2 times\n- 63: 1 time\n- 77: 1 time\n- 78: 1 time\n- 82: 1 time\n- 86: 1 time\n- 87: 1 time\n- 89: 4 times\n- 91: 1 time\n- 94: 3 times\n- 96: 1 time\n- 100: 3 times\n\n**Reflection**: The score 89 appears 4 times, which is more than any other score. Therefore, 89 is the mode.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Double-Checking the Mode**\n\n**Thought Process**: Before finalizing, let's confirm that 89 is indeed the mode by ensuring no other score has a higher frequency.\n\n**Action**: I'll quickly scan the frequency counts to ensure 89 is the only score with a frequency of 4 or higher.\n\n#### **Quick Check**:\n\n- **89**: 4 times\n- All other scores: 3 times or fewer\n\n**Reflection**: Yes, 89 has the highest frequency. No other score matches or exceeds this count.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the corrected frequency counts and verification, **the mode of the scores is 89**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Miscount**: At first, I didn't account for duplicate leaves within stems, which led to an incorrect total frequency count.\n- **Correction Process**: Upon re-examining the stem-and-leaf plot, I identified and corrected the duplicate counts.\n- **Outcome**: After adjusting the counts, 89 emerged as the mode, being the most frequently occurring score.\n\nBy following this step-by-step approach\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting\u2014I ensured an accurate determination of the mode. This methodical process helped catch and rectify initial counting errors, leading to the correct solution.",
