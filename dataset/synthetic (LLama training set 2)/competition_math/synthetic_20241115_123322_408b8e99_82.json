    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem, taking it step by step and mimicking a human's thought process, including brainstorming, checking for correctness, and reflecting along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question, **\u201cWhat is the maximum possible number of planes that can be determined by 12 points in space?\u201d**, I think a few things:\n\n1. **Planes and Points:** I remember from geometry that a plane is uniquely determined by three non-collinear points. So, I need to think about combinations of points.\n   \n2. **Combinatorial Approach:** This seems like a combinatorics problem where I need to calculate how many different sets of three points can be chosen from twelve.\n   \n3. **Non-Collinearity Constraint:** The points must be non-collinear, meaning no three points lie on the same line. But the question asks for the *maximum* number of planes, so I might need to consider configurations where not all sets of three points define a unique plane.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nBefore jumping in, let me brainstorm a few strategies:\n\n1. **Simple Combinations Calculation:** Calculate the number of ways to choose three points out of twelve using combinations (binomial coefficient).\n   \n2. **Consider Non-Collinearity:** Since the points are non-collinear, every set of three points should theoretically define a unique plane unless otherwise constrained.\n   \n3. **Alternative Geometric Configurations:** Maybe consider scenarios like all points lying on a single plane (which would reduce the number of unique planes) or points spread in three-dimensional space (which would maximize it).\n\nAt this point, **the simplest approach** seems like calculating the combinations, but I need to keep an eye on whether all these planes are indeed unique or if some overlap due to specific configurations.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Combinations**\n\nLet's start by calculating the total number of ways to select three points from twelve:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of planes} = \\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 220\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- 220 seems like a large number, but at first glance, it makes sense because choosing three points out of twelve in a three-dimensional space should yield many unique planes.\n  \n- However, I need to ensure that this count represents the maximum possible number of unique planes. \n\n### **Step 2: Checking for Collinearity**\n\nWait a minute\u2014**does this count consider collinearity?** The question specifies that the points are non-collinear, meaning no three points lie on the same line. Therefore, each set of three points should define a unique plane.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If all twelve points are arranged so that no three are collinear, then each combination of three points indeed defines a distinct plane.\n  \n- **But**\u2014what if some points are coplanar? For example, if all twelve points lie on a single plane, then many combinations would not define new planes because they all lie within that plane.\n\n**Possible Configurations:**\n\n1. **All Points in One Plane:** If all twelve points lie within a single plane, the maximum number of unique planes is **1**, since they're all on the same plane.\n   \n2. **Points in Multiple Planes:** If the points are spread across multiple planes but not all in one, the number of unique planes would be greater than one but less than 220, depending on how many points lie in each plane.\n\n### **Step 3: Assessing Maximum Possibility**\n\nTo **maximize** the number of unique planes, I should consider the scenario where no three points are collinear and not all points lie in a single plane.\n\n**Thinking It Through:**\n\n- If no three points are collinear and not all points lie within the same plane, then each set of three points defines a unique plane.\n  \n- This aligns with the initial combination calculation of 220.\n\n**Interim Check:**\n\n- Does 220 represent the maximum number of unique planes?\n  \n- Given the constraint of non-collinearity and the absence of additional geometric constraints, **yes**, 220 is the maximum.\n\n### **Step 4: Alternative strategy - Considering Overlaps**\n\nLet me briefly consider if there's another approach to verify this.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**\n\n- **Assume some points are collinear or coplanar:** Adjust the calculation by subtracting the number of overlapping planes due to collinearity or coplanarity.\n  \n- **But wait**\u2014the question specifies non-collinear points, so this adjustment isn't necessary.\n\n**Realization:**\n\n- Since non-collinearity is guaranteed, there's no need to subtract overlaps.\n\n**Conclusion:** \n\n- The initial combination calculation remains valid.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Verification**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's do a quick sanity check:\n\n- **Does 220 make sense?** Yes, because with twelve points in three-dimensional space, there are numerous combinations to form unique planes.\n  \n- **Is collinearity accounted for?** Yes, as the points are specified to be non-collinear.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\n- The approach is correct, and the answer is logically consistent with the problem's constraints.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully considering different strategies, checking for collinearity, and verifying the maximum possibility, the **maximum number of unique planes** that can be determined by twelve non-collinear points in space is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{220}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout this process, I started by thinking about the basic geometric principle that a plane is defined by three non-collinear points. Initially, I calculated the combinations without fully considering the implications of non-collinearity. \n\nUpon reflecting and checking, I realized that since the points are non-collinear, each combination uniquely defines a plane, confirming that the combination calculation was indeed correct.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, checking, and reflecting, ensured that the final answer was accurate and logically sound.",
