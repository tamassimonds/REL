When I first glance at it, I see that there are two circles: a larger one with a gray area and a smaller, white circular region inside. The question states that the visible gray area is three times the area of the white circle. I'm trying to figure out the ratio of the radius of the small circle to the radius of the large one.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **Proportions and Ratios:** This reminds me of problems that deal with the relationship between areas and radii in circles. Maybe I can leverage the formula for the area of a circle.\n  \n- **Area Difference:** Since the gray area is part of the larger circle but not part of the smaller circle, perhaps I can set up an equation based on the areas of both circles.\n\n- **Ratio of Areas:** I know that the ratio of the areas relates to the square of the ratio of the radii. That might be helpful here.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to approach it just yet. Let me explore a few strategies to see which one works best.\n\n## **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n### **Strategy 1: Using Area Formulas Directly**\n\nI could calculate the areas of both circles using their radii and set up an equation based on the given relationship between the gray and white areas.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. **Let\u2019s Assign Variables:** Let\u2019s call the radius of the large circle \\( R \\) and the radius of the small circle \\( r \\).\n\n2. **Write the Area Equations:**\n   - **Large Circle\u2019s Area:** \\( A_{\\text{large}} = \\pi R^2 \\)\n   - **Small Circle\u2019s Area:** \\( A_{\\text{small}} = \\pi r^2 \\)\n\n3. **Gray Area Calculation:**\n   - \\( A_{\\text{gray}} = A_{\\text{large}} - A_{\\text{small}} = \\pi R^2 - \\pi r^2 = \\pi (R^2 - r^2) \\)\n   \n4. **Given Relationship:**\n   - The gray area is three times the white area: \\( A_{\\text{gray}} = 3 \\times A_{\\text{small}} \\)\n   - So, \\( \\pi (R^2 - r^2) = 3 \\times \\pi r^2 \\)\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, that seems promising because it relates the areas directly. Let\u2019s see where this leads.\n\n### **Strategy 2: Utilizing the Ratio of Areas**\n\nAlternatively, I could directly express the ratio of the areas and relate it to the square of the ratio of the radii.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. **Recall the Ratio of Areas Formula:** \\( \\left( \\frac{R}{r} \\right)^2 = \\frac{A_{\\text{large}}}{A_{\\text{small}}} \\)\n\n2. **From the Given Relationship:**\n   - Since \\( A_{\\text{gray}} = 3 \\times A_{\\text{small}} \\), and \\( A_{\\text{gray}} = A_{\\text{large}} - A_{\\text{small}} \\), \n   - Therefore, \\( A_{\\text{large}} - A_{\\text{small}} = 3 A_{\\text{small}} \\)\n   - This simplifies to \\( A_{\\text{large}} = 4 A_{\\text{small}} \\)\n\n3. **Apply the Ratio of Areas Formula:**\n   - \\( \\left( \\frac{R}{r} \\right)^2 = 4 \\)\n   - Taking the square root, \\( \\frac{R}{r} = 2 \\)\n\n**Reflection:** This looks straightforward and direct. But I want to make sure both strategies align before finalizing the answer.\n\n## **Checking Strategy 1: Using Area Equations Directly**\n\nLet\u2019s revisit **Strategy 1** to ensure it leads to the same conclusion.\n\n**Reapplying Steps:**\n1. **Starting Equation:** \\( \\pi (R^2 - r^2) = 3 \\times \\pi r^2 \\)\n2. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   - Divide both sides by \\( \\pi \\): \\( R^2 - r^2 = 3 r^2 \\)\n   - Bring \\( r^2 \\) to the other side: \\( R^2 = 4 r^2 \\)\n3. **Take the Square Root:**\n   - \\( R = 2r \\)\n\n**Reflection:** Both strategies lead to the same ratio: \\( \\frac{R}{r} = 2 \\). This consistency gives me confidence in the solution.\n\n## **Final Check**\n\nBefore concluding, let me briefly verify if this ratio makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n**Verification:**\n- If \\( R = 2r \\), then the radius of the large circle is twice that of the small circle.\n- The area of the large circle would be four times the area of the small circle (\\( \\pi R^2 = \\pi (2r)^2 = 4\\pi r^2 \\)).\n- The gray area (which is the difference between the large and small circles) is \\( 4\\pi r^2 - \\pi r^2 = 3\\pi r^2 \\), which is indeed three times the area of the small circle.\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. The ratio \\( \\frac{R}{r} = 2 \\) is consistent with the given conditions of the problem.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming and exploring different strategies, both approaches lead to the same conclusion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{R}{r} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The ratio of the radius of the small circle to the radius of the large circle is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n**Thought Process Recap:**\n- **Explored Multiple Strategies:** Started by considering direct area calculations and the ratio of areas.\n- **Checked Consistency:** Ensured both strategies aligned to confirm the correctness of the ratio.\n- **Verified with Given Conditions:** Made sure the calculated ratio satisfied the problem's requirements.\n  \nBy approaching the problem step by step and reflecting along the way, I was able to arrive at the correct ratio confidently.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the radius of the small circle, and let $b$ be the radius of the large circle.  Then the area of the gray area is $\\pi b^2 - \\pi a^2,$ so\n\\[\\pi b^2 - \\pi a^2 = 3 (\\pi a^2).\\]Then $b^2 - a^2 = 3a^2,$ which simplifies to\n\\[b^2 = 4a^2.\\]Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $b = 2a,$ so $\\frac{a}{b} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$"
