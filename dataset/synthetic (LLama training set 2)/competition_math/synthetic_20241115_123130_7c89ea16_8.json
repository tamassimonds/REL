    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The question asks for the ratio of the volumes of a regular octahedron to that of a cube, with the octahedron formed by joining the centers of adjoining faces of the cube. \n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I recognize that it involves geometric shapes, specifically a cube and an octahedron. Here are some initial thoughts:\n\n- **Understanding Shapes:** I know a cube has six faces, and an octahedron is a polyhedron with eight faces. The regular octahedron being formed by joining the centers of the faces of the cube suggests a relationship between these two shapes.\n\n- **Volume Ratios:** The question asks for the ratio of their volumes. I recall that volume ratios depend on the cube of the ratio of corresponding linear dimensions (like edges or diagonals).\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Coordinate Geometry:** Assign coordinates to the vertices and calculate the volumes using formulas.\n  - **Dimensional Analysis:** Relate the dimensions of the octahedron and cube to find a direct volume ratio.\n  - **Taking an Example with Known Measurements:** Use specific measurements (like edge lengths) to simplify the understanding.\n\n- **Initial Approach:** I think starting with an example might help visualize the relationship better. Then, perhaps use coordinate geometry to confirm the findings.\n\nWait, let me jot down what's bothering me here. Using specific measurements could lead to a straightforward calculation, but I might miss the generalization aspect. Maybe after trying with specific values, I'll attempt to abstract it for a more general solution.\n\n### **Step 1: Visualizing the Problem with an Example**\n\nLet\u2019s consider a cube with a known edge length. This might help make the problem more tangible.\n\n- **Cube's Edge Length (a):** Let\u2019s assume the cube has an edge length of \\(a\\).\n\n- **Finding Centers of Faces:** Each face center is at a distance \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\) from the edges of the cube.\n\n- **Forming the Octahedron:**\n  - The octahedron is formed by connecting the centers of adjoining faces.\n  - This suggests that the vertices of the octahedron lie at these face centers.\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, so if I take the centers of the faces, I can picture how the octahedron is nested inside the cube. But I still need to relate their volumes. Just knowing the positions doesn't immediately help with volume calculations.\n\n### **Step 2: Using Coordinate Geometry**\n\nMaybe assigning coordinates will clarify the relationships.\n\n- **Assigning Coordinates:**\n  - Let\u2019s place the cube in a coordinate system with vertices at \\( (0,0,0) \\), \\( (a,0,0) \\), \\( (0,a,0) \\), \\( (0,0,a) \\), etc.\n  - The centers of the faces then are at:\n    - \\( (\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0) \\) for the front face\n    - \\( (\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, a) \\) for the back face\n    - \\( (\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2}) \\) for the right face\n    - \\( (\\frac{a}{2}, a, \\frac{a}{2}) \\) for the left face\n    - \\( (0, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}) \\) for the bottom face\n    - \\( (a, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}) \\) for the top face\n\nOh wait, is that too many points? I think I only need the centers of the faces. Let me double-check. Yes, since the octahedron connects centers of adjacent faces, I might only need certain combinations.\n\n**Correction:** Let\u2019s focus on the pairs that actually form the octahedron's vertices. Maybe the vertices lie at the centers of pairs of opposite faces.\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Octahedron's Vertices**\n\nOkay, let\u2019s simplify. The octahedron's vertices should be where the centers of adjoining faces meet.\n\n- **Candidate Vertices:**\n  - Let\u2019s consider the centers of opposite edges as potential vertices for the octahedron.\n  - But wait, the problem specifies centers of adjoining faces, so I need to rethink this.\n\n**Realization:** I think I misunderstood. The octahedron's vertices are formed by the intersection of the lines connecting face centers of adjoining faces.\n\n### **Step 4: Finding Actual Octahedron Vertices**\n\nLet\u2019s try again. The octahedron is formed by connecting centers of faces that share an edge.\n\n- **Selected Face Centers:**\n  - Front face: \\( (\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0) \\)\n  - Back face: \\( (\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, a) \\)\n  - Right face: \\( (\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2}) \\)\n  - Left face: \\( (\\frac{a}{2}, a, \\frac{a}{2}) \\)\n  - Bottom face: \\( (0, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}) \\)\n  - Top face: \\( (a, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}) \\)\n\nBut I'm still unsure if this is correct. Maybe I need to visualize the connections better.\n\n**Conflict:** Is this the right set of points? I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think... \n\nLet\u2019s simplify it. Perhaps the octahedron's vertices are at the midpoints of edges connecting face centers of adjoining faces.\n\n### **Step 5: Recalculating with Midpoints of Edges**\n\nOkay, new approach. Let\u2019s consider the midpoints of edges connecting face centers.\n\n- **Midpoints Calculation:**\n  - For example, the midpoint between the centers of the front face and right face:\n    \\[\n    \\left( \\frac{\\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{a}{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\frac{a}{2} + 0}{2}, \\frac{0 + \\frac{a}{2}}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{4}, \\frac{a}{4} \\right)\n    \\]\n  - Repeat this for all pairs of adjoining face centers.\n\nAh, I see where I might be going wrong. The octahedron's vertices are actually at the midpoints of lines connecting the centers of adjoining faces, but I might be mixing up which faces are adjoining.\n\n**Check:** Wait, does this still seem correct? Let me think... \n\nMaybe it's better to look at it differently. Perhaps the octahedron is inscribed within the cube, and its vertices are related to the cube's diagonals.\n\n### **Step 6: Considering Inscribed Octahedron**\n\nLet\u2019s think about an inscribed octahedron. If the octahedron is inscribed within the cube, its vertices touch the centers of the cube's edges.\n\n- **Relation to Cube Edges:**\n  - The length of the cube's edge is \\(a\\).\n  - The octahedron's vertices are at a distance from the center of the cube equal to half the space diagonal of the cube.\n\n**Reflection:** Hmm, let's see if this makes sense. The space diagonal of a cube is longer than its edges, so half of that would place the octahedron's vertices at a distance from the center.\n\nBut wait, the question specifically mentions joining the centers of adjoining faces, not the edges. I think I need to go back to the face centers.\n\n### **Step 7: Simplifying the Approach with Face Centers**\n\nAlright, let\u2019s return to the original idea of using face centers. Maybe I overcomplicated it before.\n\n- **Regrouping:**\n  - Let\u2019s focus on the centers of the six faces of the cube.\n  - An octahedron formed by connecting these points would have its vertices at the intersections of the face center connection lines.\n\nBut how do I calculate the volume of this octahedron? Maybe there's a formula I can use.\n\n### **Step 8: Using Volume Ratios for Regular Polyhedra**\n\nI recall that for regular polyhedra, there might be a direct ratio based on their geometric properties.\n\n- **For Regular Octahedron Inside a Cube:**\n  - An octahedron inscribed within a cube has a volume ratio that can be derived from its relation to the cube's space diagonal.\n\n- **Volume Formula:**\n  - The volume of the cube \\(V_{\\text{cube}} = a^3\\).\n  - The volume of the octahedron \\(V_{\\text{octa}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} a^3\\).\n\nWait a minute, where did the \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\) come from? Let me recall... Ah, I remember now. The volume of a regular octahedron inscribed within a cube is indeed \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\) times the volume of the cube.\n\n**Realization:** So, if the octahedron's volume is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} a^3\\), the ratio of their volumes is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{octa}}}{V_{\\text{cube}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} a^3}{a^3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Okay, but looking at the options provided:\n\n$\\mathrm{(A) \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(B) \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{16} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(C) \\frac{1}{6} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(D) \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{8} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(E) \\frac{1}{4} }$\n\nThe ratio \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\) doesn't match any of these. Maybe I made an error in recalling the volume formula.\n\n**Check:** Let\u2019s double-check the volume formulas for the octahedron.\n\n### **Step 9: Correcting the Volume Formula for Octahedron**\n\nI think I misremembered. The volume of a regular octahedron is indeed related to the cube it\u2019s inscribed in, but let me recall the exact ratio.\n\n- **Correct Volume Ratio:**\n  - The volume of a regular octahedron inscribed in a cube is actually \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\) times the volume of the cube.\n\nBut looking at the options again, this still doesn't match. Perhaps I need to reconsider the relationship.\n\n### **Step 10: Exploring Another Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s explore a different method to verify this.\n\n- **Using Geometric Relationships:**\n  - The octahedron is formed by connecting the centers of the cube's faces.\n  - The distances between these centers can be related to the cube's diagonals.\n\n- **Calculating Diagonal Relationships:**\n  - The space diagonal of the cube is \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n  - The length related to the octahedron's edges can be derived from this.\n\nBut honestly, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to use a different strategy.\n\n### **Step 11: Switching to Example-Based Calculation**\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the initial idea of using specific measurements.\n\n- **Let\u2019s Take a Cube with Edge Length \\(a = 1\\):**\n  - This simplifies calculations and helps in visualizing the problem.\n\n- **Calculating the Octahedron's Volume:**\n  - Using the formula for the volume of an octahedron inscribed in a cube:\n    \\[\n    V_{\\text{octa}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} a^3\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    V_{\\text{octa}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\times 1^3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\n    \\]\n\nWait a second, this still doesn't match the options. Ah, I see now. The problem might be asking for the ratio in terms of \\(\\mathrm{(A)}\\) to \\(\\mathrm{(E)}\\), and perhaps the ratios need to be simplified differently.\n\n**Realization:** Maybe the volume should be expressed in terms of the cube's volume proportionally, and the ratio needs to be simplified accordingly.\n\n### **Step 12: Simplifying the Ratio**\n\nLet\u2019s express the ratio in terms of the cube\u2019s volume.\n\n- **Volume of Cube:**\n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{cube}} = a^3 = 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Volume of Octahedron:**\n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{octa}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Ratio of Volumes:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{octa}}}{V_{\\text{cube}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}}{1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\n  \\]\n\nBut this still doesn't match the provided options. Maybe I need to reconsider how the volume of the octahedron relates to the cube's volume. \n\n**Check:** Let me recall another step... Oh, I think I remember now. The volume of the octahedron is indeed \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} a^3\\), but the ratio might need to be expressed in the options provided.\n\n### **Step 13: Matching with Provided Options**\n\nLet\u2019s try to express \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\) in terms of the options given.\n\n- **Given Options:**\n  \\[\n  \\mathrm{(A) \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(B) \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{16} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(C) \\frac{1}{6} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(D) \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{8} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(E) \\frac{1}{4} }\n  \\]\n\nWait, none of the options seem to directly match \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\). This is confusing. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\n**Reflection:** Maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let\u2019s step back and reconsider the approach.\n\n### **Step 14: Rethinking the Approach with Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nPerhaps using the Pythagorean theorem could help in relating the dimensions of the cube and the octahedron.\n\n- **Calculating Distances:**\n  - The distance between centers of adjoining faces can be calculated.\n  - This distance could represent the edge length of the octahedron.\n\nBut honestly, this feels like it might complicate things further. Maybe I should look for a geometric property that relates their volumes directly.\n\n### **Step 15: Leveraging Known Volume Ratios**\n\nI vaguely remember that when dealing with regular polyhedra like this, there's a known ratio.\n\n- **Volume Ratio for Octahedron and Cube:**\n  - The volume of a regular octahedron inscribed in a cube is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the cube's volume.\n\nBut this doesn't match the options either. Let me think... \n\n### **Step 16: Considering Different Types of Octahedra**\n\nMaybe the octahedron in question isn't a regular one, or perhaps the ratio is being expressed differently.\n\n- **Regular Octahedrons vs. Rectangular Ones:**\n  - The problem mentions a \"regular\" octahedron formed by joining the centers of adjoining faces.\n  - This suggests it's a specific type of octahedron, perhaps one that doesn't align perfectly with the cube's geometry.\n\n**Realization:** Could it be that the ratio is different from the standard \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) due to the octahedron's specific construction?\n\n### **Step 17: Finalizing the Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s finalize the approach by considering the geometric relationships and known volume ratios.\n\n- **Given the Problem\u2019s Specifics:**\n  - A regular octahedron formed by joining the centers of adjoining faces of a cube.\n  - The volume ratio can be derived from the geometric properties.\n\n- **Correct Volume Ratio:**\n  - The volume of the octahedron is indeed \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} a^3\\).\n  - The ratio of the volumes is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\).\n\nBut again, none of the provided options match this. This suggests that there might be a misunderstanding in interpreting the problem or that the options are formatted differently.\n\n**Check:** Wait, perhaps the ratio needs to be simplified or expressed differently to match one of the options.\n\n### **Step 18: Simplifying \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\) to Match Options**\n\nLet\u2019s try to express \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\) in a format that fits one of the options.\n\n- **Expressing \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) as Decimal:**\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculating \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1.414}{3} \\approx 0.4713\n  \\]\n  \n- **Matching with Options:**\n  - None of the options directly match this decimal value.\n  \n**Reflection:** It seems that the ratio \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\) doesn\u2019t correspond to any of the provided options, which is confusing.\n\n**Thought Process:** Maybe there's an error in the problem statement or the options provided. Alternatively, the interpretation of the octahedron's volume might need to be reconsidered.\n\n### **Step 19: Considering Alternative Volume Expressions**\n\nPerhaps the volume of the octahedron can be expressed in another way that matches the given options.\n\n- **Alternative Volume Formula:**\n  - The volume of a regular octahedron can also be expressed in terms of its edge length \\(e\\).\n  - For an octahedron inscribed in a cube with edge length \\(a\\), the relation is \\(e = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n  - Therefore, \\(V_{\\text{octa}} = \\frac{e^3}{3\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{a^3}{6}\\).\n\n**Realization:** This suggests that the volume of the octahedron is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) times the cube's volume, which would correspond to option **(C)**.\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, that aligns with option **(C)}\\frac{1}{6}**. Let me double-check this.\n\n### **Step 20: Verifying with Edge Length Relationship**\n\nLet\u2019s verify this by relating the octahedron\u2019s edge length to the cube\u2019s edge length.\n\n- **Edge Length Relation:**\n  - The edge length \\(e\\) of the octahedron is related to the cube\u2019s edge length \\(a\\) by \\(e = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n  \n- **Calculating Volume:**\n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{octa}} = \\frac{e^3}{3\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^3}{3\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{a^3}{2\\sqrt{2}}}{3\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{a^3}{6}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Volume Ratio:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{octa}}}{V_{\\text{cube}}} = \\frac{\\frac{a^3}{6}}{a^3} = \\frac{1}{6}\n  \\]\n\nAh, I see now. So, the volume of the octahedron is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) times the volume of the cube, which matches option **(C)**.\n\n**Reflection:** This makes sense and aligns with option **(C)}\\frac{1}{6}**. It seems that my initial approach led me astray, but by re-examining the relationships between the cube and the octahedron, I arrived at the correct ratio.\n\n### **Step 21: Final Conclusion**\n\n- **Correct Ratio:** The ratio of the volume of the octahedron to the volume of the cube is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n  \n- **Corresponding Option:** This corresponds to option **(C)}\\frac{1}{6}**.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Initially, I considered several strategies, including using specific measurements and coordinate geometry. However, reflecting on known geometric properties and volume relationships led me to conclude that the volume ratio is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). It's essential to re-check and verify each step to ensure the correctness of the final answer, especially when the initial approach seems off.",
