    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process step by step, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and making adjustments as needed. It\u2019s important to approach this like a human would, with brainstorming, checking, and perhaps even backtracking if something doesn\u2019t seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I notice:\n\n- **Question:** What is the radius of the inscribed circle (incircle) for triangle \\(ABC\\) with sides \\(AB = 10\\), \\(AC = 17\\), and \\(BC = 21\\)?\n  \n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving Heron\u2019s formula and the properties of incircles. I know that the radius of an incircle is related to the area and the semi-perimeter of the triangle. But let me think through a few different strategies to make sure I\u2019m on the right track.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Heron\u2019s Formula to Calculate the Area:**\n   - Compute the semi-perimeter (\\(s\\)).\n   - Use \\(s\\) to apply Heron\u2019s formula for the area (\\(A\\)).\n   - Use the formula for the incircle radius: \\( r = \\frac{A}{s} \\).\n\n2. **Try Trigonometric Methods:**\n   - Use the law of cosines to find angles.\n   - Use trigonometric identities to find the area.\n   - Then find the radius as above.\n\n3. **Check if It\u2019s a Right Triangle:**\n   - If \\(ABC\\) is a right triangle, the incircle formula might simplify.\n   - However, right triangles have specific relationships, so I\u2019ll verify if this applies.\n\n**Reflection:** At first glance, I think the Heron\u2019s Formula approach is straightforward and commonly used for such problems. But I\u2019m also curious if checking for a right triangle might simplify things.\n\n### **Step 1: Check for a Right Triangle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- A right triangle has one angle measuring \\(90^\\circ\\).\n- I\u2019ll check if the sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\), where \\(c\\) is the longest side.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nAB^2 + AC^2 = 10^2 + 17^2 = 100 + 289 = 389\n\\]\n\n\\[\nBC^2 = 21^2 = 441\n\\]\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n\\[\n389 \\neq 441\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, \\(389\\) does not equal \\(441\\), so the Pythagorean theorem doesn\u2019t hold.\n- **Conclusion:** Triangle \\(ABC\\) is **not** a right triangle.\n\n**Mistake Check:**\n- I initially thought checking for a right triangle might help, but since it\u2019s not, I\u2019ll proceed with the Heron\u2019s Formula method.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Semi-perimeter (\\(s\\))**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The semi-perimeter is half the sum of the triangle's sides: \n\\[ s = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{10 + 17 + 21}{2} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Okay, so the semi-perimeter \\(s\\) is \\(24\\). This seems reasonable.\n\n### **Step 3: Apply Heron\u2019s Formula to Find the Area (\\(A\\))**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Heron\u2019s formula states:\n\\[\nA = \\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the side lengths.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Let\u2019s plug in the values:\n\n\\[\nA = \\sqrt{24(24 - 10)(24 - 17)(24 - 21)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{24 \\times 14 \\times 7 \\times 3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{24 \\times 294}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{7056}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 84\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, the area \\(A\\) of triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(84\\).\n- **Quick Check:** \\(84\\) seems like a plausible area for a triangle with sides \\(10\\), \\(17\\), and \\(21\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Radius of the Incircle (\\(r\\))**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The formula for the radius of the incircle is:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{A}{s}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{84}{24} = 3.5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The radius \\(r\\) of the incircle is \\(3.5\\).\n- **Check:** This makes sense given the area and semi-perimeter.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let me quickly check if each step aligns logically.\n- From calculating the semi-perimeter to applying Heron\u2019s formula, everything seems to flow correctly.\n- The semi-perimeter and area calculations are consistent.\n\n**Mistake Check:**\n- **Did I apply Heron\u2019s formula correctly?** Yes, substituted the values correctly.\n- **Is the semi-perimeter calculated right?** Yes, \\(s = 24\\).\n- **Does the incircle radius formula make sense?** Absolutely, it\u2019s a standard relationship.\n\n### **Alternate Strategy: Trigonometric Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- While the Heron\u2019s formula worked well, I\u2019m curious if a trigonometric approach could yield the same result.\n- Perhaps using the law of cosines to find an angle, then applying the formula for the area using trigonometric identities.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This might be more complex than necessary since Heron\u2019s formula provided a straightforward solution.\n- **Conclusion:** It\u2019s always good to have multiple strategies, but Heron's was efficient here.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Does the final answer make sense?** Yes, a radius of \\(3.5\\) for the incircle is reasonable.\n- **Did I explore different strategies?** Yes, checked for right triangles and considered trigonometric methods.\n- **Was the approach consistent?** Yes, each step logically followed the previous one.\n- **Is there anything I would do differently?** Not really, the Heron\u2019s formula approach was direct and effective.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe radius of the circle inscribed in triangle \\(ABC\\) is **3.5**.",

Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24\\cdot 14\\cdot 7\\cdot 3} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2\\cdot 7^2} \\\\\n&= 84.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$84 = r\\cdot 24,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{3.5}$."
