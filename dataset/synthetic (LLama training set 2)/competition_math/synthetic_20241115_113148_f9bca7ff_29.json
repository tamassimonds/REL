    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on whether they work, and adjusting as needed\u2014just like I would if tackling this problem in real life.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, my initial reaction is to **recognize that I have three equations involving three variables**: \\( xy = 24 \\), \\( xz = 48 \\), and \\( yz = 72 \\). \n\nThis setup immediately **reminds me of systems of equations**, possibly hinting at using substitution or elimination methods. However, I also recall that such problems sometimes involve **taking products or ratios** of the equations to eliminate variables. \n\nBut to be honest, I'm **not entirely sure which method will be the most straightforward** right now. I feel like I need to brainstorm a bit to see which approach looks promising.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Taking Ratios of the Equations**: Maybe I can divide one equation by another to eliminate variables.\n  \n2. **Multiplying All Equations Together**: Perhaps multiplying all three equations might simplify things by solving for \\( xyz \\).\n\n3. **Using Substitution**: I could solve one equation for a variable and substitute it into the others.\n\n4. **Solving for Individual Variables First**: Find \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) separately before adding them together.\n\n**Initial Reaction**: The **taking ratios** method seems appealing because it might reduce the number of variables quickly. But then again, **multiplying all equations** together also looks straightforward. I'll start with taking ratios and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Ratios**\n\n**Goal**: To eliminate variables by dividing equations.\n\nLet's take the first two equations:\n\n\\[ \nxy = 24 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)} \n\\]\n\\[ \nxz = 48 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)} \n\\]\n\n**Thinking**: If I divide Equation 2 by Equation 1, I might be able to find a relationship between \\( y \\) and \\( z \\).\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{xz}{xy} = \\frac{48}{24} \n\\]\n\n**Calculations**:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{xz}{xy} = \\frac{48}{24} \\implies \\frac{z}{y} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: **Wait, this is useful!** I\u2019ve found that \\( z = 2y \\). This relationship might help me connect \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) later.\n\n**Check**: Does this make sense? Yes, because when I divided, the \\( x \\) terms canceled out, leaving me a clear ratio between \\( z \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting z = 2y**\n\n**Goal**: Use the relationship \\( z = 2y \\) to express everything in terms of \\( y \\) and \\( x \\).\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\( z = 2y \\) into the third equation:\n\n\\[ \nyz = 72 \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)} \n\\]\n\n**Thinking**: If I replace \\( z \\) with \\( 2y \\), I can solve for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\).\n\n\\[ \ny(2y) = 72 \\implies 2y^2 = 72 \n\\]\n\n**Calculations**:\n\n\\[\ny^2 = \\frac{72}{2} = 36 \\implies y = 6 \\quad (\\text{since } y \\text{ is positive}) \n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: **Hmm, that worked out nicely!** I found \\( y = 6 \\). Now, I can use this to find \\( z \\) using \\( z = 2y \\).\n\n**Check**: \\( z = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\). Okay, so \\( z = 12 \\). This seems consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for x**\n\n**Goal**: Now that I have \\( y \\) and \\( z \\), I can find \\( x \\) using one of the original equations.\n\nLet\u2019s use Equation 2:\n\n\\[ \nxz = 48 \n\\]\n\n**Thinking**: I know \\( z = 12 \\), so I can substitute that into the equation to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n\\[ \nx(12) = 48 \n\\]\n\n**Calculations**:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{48}{12} = 4 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: **Alright, \\( x = 4 \\).** Now I have all three variables: \\( x = 4 \\), \\( y = 6 \\), \\( z = 12 \\).\n\n**Check**: Let\u2019s quickly verify with the original equations:\n\n- \\( xy = 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\( xz = 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\( yz = 6 \\times 12 = 72 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating \\( x + y + z \\)**\n\n**Goal**: Finally, add the values of \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) together to find the answer.\n\n**Thinking**: This part is straightforward\u2014just sum them up.\n\n\\[ \nx + y + z = 4 + 6 + 12 \n\\]\n\n**Calculations**:\n\n\\[\nx + y + z = 22 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: **So, \\( x + y + z = 22 \\).** That seems reasonable given the values of \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\).\n\n**Check**: **Let me quickly double-check the addition:** \\( 4 + 6 = 10 \\), and \\( 10 + 12 = 22\\). Yes, the addition is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Multiplying All Equations Together**\n\n**Thought**: Since I\u2019m getting \\( x + y + z = 22 \\) through the ratio method, I wonder if multiplying all three equations would lead to the same result. This might serve as a **cross-check**.\n\n**Step by Step**:\n\n1. **Multiply all three equations**:\n\n\\[\n(xy)(xz)(yz) = 24 \\times 48 \\times 72 \n\\]\n\n2. **Simplify the left side**:\n\n\\[\nx^2y^2z^2 \n\\]\n\n3. **Take the square root**:\n\n\\[\nxyz = \\sqrt{24 \\times 48 \\times 72} \n\\]\n\n**Thinking**: **Hmm, calculating this square root might be tedious.** Let me see if I can simplify the product under the square root first.\n\n**Calculations**:\n\n\\[\n24 = 2^3 \\times 3^1 \n\\]\n\\[\n48 = 2^4 \\times 3^1 \n\\]\n\\[\n72 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow 24 \\times 48 \\times 72 = (2^3 \\times 3^1) \\times (2^4 \\times 3^1) \\times (2^3 \\times 3^2) \n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 2^{3+4+3} \\times 3^{1+1+2} = 2^{10} \\times 3^4 \n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow xyz = \\sqrt{2^{10} \\times 3^4} = 2^5 \\times 3^2 = 32 \\times 9 = 288 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: **Wait, I got \\( xyz = 288 \\)?** But our earlier method involved ratios that led us directly to individual values. Multiplying all equations together, though accurate, gives the product \\( xyz \\), not the sum \\( x + y + z \\). **Hmm, maybe this approach isn't directly helpful for finding \\( x + y + z \\).**\n\n**Check**: The value \\( xyz = 288 \\) doesn't seem misaligned because the ratios were consistent. However, **multiplying all equations** doesn't directly lead us to the sum \\( x + y + z \\); it only confirms the product \\( xyz \\).\n\n**Conclusion**: While this alternative method verifies the product \\( xyz \\), it doesn't assist in finding \\( x + y + z \\) directly. Therefore, the **original ratio method** remains the most straightforward and efficient for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThrough exploring different strategies, **starting with taking ratios**, I was able to find the individual values of \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) quickly:\n\n- \\( x = 4 \\)\n- \\( y = 6 \\)\n- \\( z = 12 \\)\n\nAdding them up gives \\( x + y + z = 22 \\).\n\n**Reflection**: Initially, I considered multiple approaches, but **taking ratios** proved effective in connecting the variables. Multiplying all equations together confirmed the product \\( xyz \\), but **to find the sum**, the ratio method was more direct.\n\n**Check**: Verifying each step ensured accuracy, and alternative methods like multiplying all equations served as a cross-check, confirming that the product relationships were consistent.\n\nIn conclusion, **approaching the problem step by step**, reflecting frequently, and being open to trying different methods led to a clear and accurate solution.",
