    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming along the way, just like how I would tackle it as a human. I'll show my thought process, explore different strategies, troubleshoot when things don't work, and check my work often to ensure everything's on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x}{x^2 - 8x + 15} = \\frac{A}{x-3} + \\frac{B}{x-5}\n\\]\n\nI think, \"This looks like a partial fraction decomposition problem.\" Partial fractions are used to break down a rational function into simpler fractions, which can make integration or other operations easier.\n\n**Initially, I recall:**\n- **Partial Fraction Decomposition:** This technique is typically applied to rational expressions where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. The goal is to express the rational function as a sum of simpler fractions.\n- **Factors of the Denominator:** The denominator \\(x^2 - 8x + 15\\) can likely be factored into linear components, which match the denominators on the right side \\((x - 3)(x - 5)\\).\n\nBut honestly, I'm also thinking, \"Wait, is my memory serving me right here? Maybe there\u2019s something tricky I'm missing.\"\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Factoring the Denominator:** First, I'll try factoring \\(x^2 - 8x + 15\\) to see if it matches \\((x - 3)(x - 5)\\).\n- **Setting Up the Equation:** Once factored, I'll set up the equation with coefficients \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) representing the numerators of the partial fractions.\n- **Solving for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):** Maybe I'll combine both sides and equate coefficients to solve for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n- **Checking the Solution:** After finding \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), I should plug them back into the original equation to verify if both sides are equal.\n\nBut before jumping in, I'm thinking, \"Let's take it one step at a time to avoid making mistakes.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factor the Denominator**\n\nFirst, I'll attempt to factor the quadratic expression in the denominator:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x + 15\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Magnitude of Constants:** I notice that \\( -8x \\) is large in magnitude compared to the constants around it. This makes me think that perhaps the quadratic can be factored into two binomials.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(+15\\) (the constant term) and add up to \\(-8\\) (the linear coefficient).\n- Possible pairs: \\( (1, 15), (3, 5), (-1, -15), (-3, -5) \\)\n- The pair that adds up to \\(-8\\) is \\(-3\\) and \\(-5\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x + 15 = (x - 3)(x - 5)\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n- Quick multiplication: \\( (x - 3)(x - 5) = x^2 - 5x - 3x + 15 = x^2 - 8x + 15\\)\n- **Result:** Yes, it matches the original quadratic. So, factoring seems correct.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Success:** This seems right. Factoring the denominator simplifies the fraction, making the partial fraction decomposition more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Set Up the Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\nNow that I know the denominator factors into \\((x - 3)(x - 5)\\), I can set up the equation for partial fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x}{(x - 3)(x - 5)} = \\frac{A}{x - 3} + \\frac{B}{x - 5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Purpose of A and B:** Here, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants that need to be determined. Each fraction represents a component of the original rational expression.\n- **Matching Structures:** The left side is a single fraction, while the right side is a sum of two fractions. By finding a common denominator, I can combine them and compare coefficients.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does this setup make sense? Yes, because by breaking the left side into partial fractions, I can equate numerators after finding a common denominator.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Right Side into a Single Fraction**\n\nTo proceed, I'll combine the right side into a single fraction to make it easier to compare both sides.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{x - 3} + \\frac{B}{x - 5} = \\frac{A(x - 5) + B(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x - 5)}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Expand the numerators:\n  \\[\n  A(x - 5) + B(x - 3) = Ax - 5A + Bx - 3B = (A + B)x - (5A + 3B)\n  \\]\n  \n**Result:**\n\\[\n\\frac{(A + B)x - (5A + 3B)}{(x - 3)(x - 5)}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Structure Matching:** Now, both sides have the same denominator. This makes it easier to compare numerators and set up equations for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check Work:** Is this expansion correct? Yes, expanding \\(A(x - 5)\\) and \\(B(x - 3)\\) seems correct because I distributed \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) properly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Equate Numerators to Solve for A and B**\n\nSince the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal for the equality to hold for all \\(x\\) (except \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = 5\\)).\n\n\\[\n4x = (A + B)x - (5A + 3B)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Matching Coefficients:** To solve for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), I'll match coefficients of \\(x\\) and the constant terms separately.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. **Coefficient of \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   4 = A + B \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Constant Term:**\n   \\[\n   0 = - (5A + 3B) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5A + 3B = 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **System of Equations:** Now, I have a system of linear equations:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{cases}\n    A + B = 4 \\\\\n    5A + 3B = 0\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Need to Solve:** I can solve this system using substitution or elimination to find the values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n**Checking:**\n- **Approach Validity:** Does this make sense? Yes, because equating numerators is a standard step in partial fraction decomposition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Method 1: Substitution**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Use Equation 1:** I can express \\(A\\) in terms of \\(B\\) using the first equation and then substitute into the second equation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- From Equation 1:\n  \\[\n  A = 4 - B\n  \\]\n  \n- Substitute into Equation 2:\n  \\[\n  5(4 - B) + 3B = 0 \\\\\n  20 - 5B + 3B = 0 \\\\\n  20 - 2B = 0 \\\\\n  2B = 20 \\\\\n  B = 10\n  \\]\n  \n- **Finding A:**\n  \\[\n  A = 4 - B = 4 - 10 = -6\n  \\]\n  \n**Results:**\n\\[\nA = -6, \\quad B = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Quick Check:** Wait, let me verify if these numbers make sense. Plugging \\(B = 10\\) into the second equation:\n  \\[\n  5(-6) + 3(10) = -30 + 30 = 0 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n  \\]\n- **Consistency:** The equations are satisfied, so the values seem correct.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Alternative Method:** But maybe there's another method to double-check this. Let's try elimination.\n\n---\n\n**Method 2: Elimination**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Adding Equations:** Adding both equations might simplify finding \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Equation 1: \\(A + B = 4\\)\n- Equation 2: \\(5A + 3B = 0\\)\n\n**Adding Equations:**\n\\[\n(A + B) + (5A + 3B) = 4 + 0 \\\\\n6A + 4B = 4 \\\\\n\\]\n  \n**Simplify:**\n\\[\n3A + 2B = 2 \\quad \\text{(Divided both sides by 2)}\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Use Original Equation:** Now, I can use this simplified equation along with Equation 1 to solve for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Substitute:** From Equation 1: \\(A + B = 4\\)\n- **Express B in Terms of A:**\n  \\[\n  B = 4 - A\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substitute into Simplified Equation:**\n  \\[\n  3A + 2(4 - A) = 2 \\\\\n  3A + 8 - 2A = 2 \\\\\n  A + 8 = 2 \\\\\n  A = 2 - 8 \\\\\n  A = -6\n  \\]\n  \n- **Find B:**\n  \\[\n  B = 4 - (-6) = 4 + 6 = 10\n  \\]\n  \n**Results:**\n\\[\nA = -6, \\quad B = 10\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n- **Both Methods Consistent:** Both methods yield the same values for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which adds confidence that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Plugging Back:** To ensure the solution is correct, I'll substitute \\(A = -6\\) and \\(B = 10\\) back into the original equation and see if both sides are equal.\n\n**Original Equation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{4x}{x^2 - 8x + 15} = \\frac{A}{x - 3} + \\frac{B}{x - 5}\n\\]\n\n**Substitute A and B:**\n\\[\n\\frac{4x}{(x - 3)(x - 5)} = \\frac{-6}{x - 3} + \\frac{10}{x - 5}\n\\]\n\n**Combine Right Side:**\n\\[\n\\frac{-6(x - 5) + 10(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x - 5)} = \\frac{-6x + 30 + 10x - 30}{(x - 3)(x - 5)} = \\frac{4x}{(x - 3)(x - 5)}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\\[\n\\frac{4x}{(x - 3)(x - 5)} = \\frac{4x}{(x - 3)(x - 5)} \\quad \\text{(Both sides are equal)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Success:** The equation holds true with \\(A = -6\\) and \\(B = 10\\), confirming that the values are correct.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Approach Validated:** The partial fraction decomposition worked as expected, and by verifying the solution, I ensured accuracy.\n\n**Key Learning:**\n- **Multiple Strategies:** Exploring different methods (substitution and elimination) provided a better check and validated the correctness of the solution.\n- **Importance of Verification:** Plugging back the values into the original equation is crucial to confirm that the solution is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n(A, B) = (-6, 10)\n\\]\n\n---\n\nIn summary, by brainstorming various strategies, carefully applying partial fraction decomposition, and verifying the solution through multiple methods, I arrived at the correct values for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Each step included reflections and checks to ensure the approach was on track, demonstrating a human-like problem-solving process with natural doubts and confirmations.",

  "ground_truth": "Factoring the denominator on the left side gives \\[ \\frac{4x}{(x-5)(x-3)}=\\frac{A}{x-3}+\\frac{B}{x-5}. \\]Then, we multiply both sides of the equation by $(x - 3)(x - 5)$ to get \\[ 4x = A(x-5) + B(x-3). \\]If the linear expression $4x$ agrees with the linear expression $A(x-5) + B(x-3)$ at all values of $x$ besides 3 and 5, then the two expressions must agree for $x=3$ and $x=5$ as well.  Substituting $x = 3$, we get $12 = -2A$, so $A = -6$.  Likewise, we plug in $x = 5$ to solve for $B$. Substituting $x = 5$, we get $20 = 2B$, so $B = 10$.  Therefore, $(A, B) = \\boxed{(-6, 10)}.$"
