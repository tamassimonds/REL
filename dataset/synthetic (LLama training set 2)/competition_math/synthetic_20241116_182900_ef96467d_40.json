    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into solving the problem step by step, reflecting often, and making sure each part of the process is correct before moving on. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies, checking my work regularly, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how a human would tackle a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I notice a few key things:\n\n- **Functional Equation:** The function \\( f(x) \\) satisfies the equation \\( f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n- **Given Information:** We know \\( f(4) = 5 \\).\n- **Goal:** Find \\( f(5) \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This resembles **Cauchy's Functional Equation**, which typically implies that the function is linear under certain conditions.\n- **Thought:** Maybe I can use properties of linear functions to find \\( f(5) \\).\n- **Alternative Idea:** Perhaps I can explore specific values and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let\u2019s explore these ideas step by step to see which path leads to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Linear Function Idea**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf \\( f(x) \\) is a linear function, it can be expressed as \\( f(x) = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( b \\) are constants. Given the functional equation, let's see if this form satisfies it.\n\n**Checking the Functional Equation:**\n\n- Assume \\( f(x) = mx + b \\).\n- Substitute into the equation:  \n  \\( f(x + y) = m(x + y) + b = mx + my + b \\)\n- Compare with the right side:  \n  \\( f(x) + f(y) = (mx + b) + (my + b) = mx + my + 2b \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy. The left side has \\( b \\), but the right side has \\( 2b \\). This suggests that \\( b \\) must be zero for the equation to hold. \n\n**Conclusion from Step 1:**\n\nSo, if \\( b = 0 \\), then \\( f(x) = mx \\) satisfies the equation. This implies that \\( f(x) \\) is a linear function passing through the origin.\n\n**Idea:**  \nUse the given \\( f(4) = 5 \\) to determine the value of \\( m \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Linear Function Coefficient**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that we suspect \\( f(x) = mx \\), let\u2019s use the given information to find \\( m \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven \\( f(4) = 5 \\):  \n\\[\nf(4) = m \\times 4 = 5\n\\]  \n\\[\nm = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat makes sense. If \\( m = \\frac{5}{4} \\), then the function would be \\( f(x) = \\frac{5}{4}x \\).\n\n**Check:**  \nLet\u2019s verify if this satisfies the original functional equation.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- Left Side:  \n  \\( f(x + y) = \\frac{5}{4}(x + y) = \\frac{5}{4}x + \\frac{5}{4}y \\)\n\n- Right Side:  \n  \\( f(x) + f(y) = \\frac{5}{4}x + \\frac{5}{4}y \\)\n\n**Result:**\n\nBoth sides are equal, so \\( f(x) = \\frac{5}{4}x \\) satisfies the functional equation.\n\n**Conclusion from Step 2:**\n\nAssuming \\( f(x) \\) is linear and passing through the origin checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Linear Function to Find \\( f(5) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that we have \\( f(x) = \\frac{5}{4}x \\), we can easily find \\( f(5) \\) by substituting \\( x = 5 \\) into the equation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(5) = \\frac{5}{4} \\times 5 = \\frac{25}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, \\( \\frac{25}{4} \\) is equal to 6.25. Let me double-check if this makes sense within the context of the problem.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Does \\( f(5) = 6.25 \\) align with the linear progression from \\( f(4) = 5 \\)?\n- Yes, because \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\times 5 = 6.25 \\), which is a consistent continuation from \\( f(4) = 5 \\).\n\n**Conclusion from Step 3:**\n\nThe value \\( f(5) = \\frac{25}{4} \\) or 6.25 seems correct based on the linear function we've derived.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Entire Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s ensure that each step is logically sound and that no part of the process introduces errors.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Assumed \\( f(x) = mx \\) based on the functional equation. This led to identifying \\( b = 0 \\), which was correct.\n- **Step 2:** Calculated \\( m = \\frac{5}{4} \\) using the given \\( f(4) = 5 \\). This fits perfectly.\n- **Step 3:** Found \\( f(5) = \\frac{25}{4} \\) using the linear function. This aligns with the expected progression.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The assumption of linearity was key, and the calculations are consistent throughout.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nDoes \\( f(5) = \\frac{25}{4} \\) make sense in the context of the problem?  \nYes, it follows logically from \\( f(4) = 5 \\) and maintains the properties defined by the functional equation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe approach is correct, and the final answer is consistent with all given information.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nf(5) = \\frac{25}{4} \\text{ or } 6.25\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Approach:**\n\n1. **Assumed Linearity:** Based on the functional equation, concluded that \\( f(x) \\) is a linear function passing through the origin.\n2. **Determined Coefficient:** Used the given \\( f(4) = 5 \\) to find \\( m = \\frac{5}{4} \\).\n3. **Calculated \\( f(5) \\):** Substituted \\( x = 5 \\) into the linear function to get \\( f(5) = \\frac{25}{4} \\).\n4. **Verified Steps:** Ensured each part of the process was logically sound and consistent with the functional equation.\n\n**Reflection Throughout:**\n\n- Initially unsure about the form of \\( f(x) \\), but recognizing the need for linearity was crucial.\n- Checked the functional equation to confirm that \\( b = 0 \\).\n- Regularly verified calculations to maintain accuracy.\n- Final answer was consistent and aligned with the given data.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, along with constant reflections and checks, ensured that the solution was accurate and reliable.",
