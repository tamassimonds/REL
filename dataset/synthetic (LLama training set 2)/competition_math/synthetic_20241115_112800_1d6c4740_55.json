The question is about finding the area of a right-angled triangle \\( \\triangle PQR \\) with vertices at \\( P(0, 5) \\), \\( Q(6, 9) \\), and \\( R(12, 0) \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **Right-Angled Triangle:** I know that a right-angled triangle has one angle equal to \\( 90^\\circ \\). This suggests that maybe one of the sides is perpendicular to another.\n- **Vertices Coordinates:** Since the triangle's vertices are given in coordinate form, calculating distances between points using the distance formula might be useful.\n- **Area Calculation:** I remember that the area of a triangle can be found using the formula involving base and height. Alternatively, since it's a right triangle, perhaps using the legs (the two sides forming the right angle) as base and height could simplify things.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Verify Right Angle:** Check if any of the angles is \\( 90^\\circ \\) to confirm it's a right triangle.\n2. **Calculate Side Lengths:** Use the distance formula to find the lengths of all sides.\n3. **Identify Base and Height:** Determine which sides are the legs of the right triangle.\n4. **Compute Area:** Use the lengths of the legs to find the area.\n5. **Alternative Method:** Consider using the formula for the area of a triangle given coordinates.\n\n**Reflection:**\nBefore I start calculating, I think it\u2019s crucial to confirm whether \\( \\triangle PQR \\) is indeed a right-angled triangle. If it's not, the given information might lead me astray. Let\u2019s proceed with verifying the right angle first.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Verifying if \\( \\triangle PQR \\) is Right-Angled\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo check if \\( \\triangle PQR \\) is right-angled, I can verify if the dot product of two vectors is zero. If the dot product is zero, the vectors are perpendicular, indicating a right angle.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Define Vectors:**\n   - \\( \\vec{PQ} = Q - P = (6 - 0, 9 - 5) = (6, 4) \\)\n   - \\( \\vec{QR} = R - Q = (12 - 6, 0 - 9) = (6, -9) \\)\n\n2. **Compute Dot Product:**\n   \\[\n   \\vec{PQ} \\cdot \\vec{QR} = (6)(6) + (4)(-9) = 36 - 36 = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, the dot product is zero, which means \\( \\vec{PQ} \\) and \\( \\vec{QR} \\) are perpendicular. This confirms that there is a right angle in \\( \\triangle PQR \\). So, the triangle is indeed right-angled.\n\n**Check:**\nThis makes sense because if two vectors are perpendicular, the angle between them is \\( 90^\\circ \\). Since \\( P \\) is at \\( (0, 5) \\), and both \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\) have the same x-coordinate (\\( x = 6 \\) and \\( x = 12 \\) respectively), it suggests vertical and horizontal alignment, which is characteristic of right triangles.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Calculating Side Lengths\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I\u2019ve confirmed it\u2019s a right-angled triangle, I need to find the lengths of the sides to determine which are the legs (base and height) and which one is the hypotenuse.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Length \\( PQ \\):**\n   \\[\n   PQ = \\sqrt{(6 - 0)^2 + (9 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 16} = \\sqrt{52} = 2\\sqrt{13}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Length \\( QR \\):**\n   \\[\n   QR = \\sqrt{(12 - 6)^2 + (0 - 9)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 81} = \\sqrt{117} = 3\\sqrt{13}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Length \\( RP \\):**\n   \\[\n   RP = \\sqrt{(12 - 0)^2 + (0 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, so the lengths are \\( PQ = 2\\sqrt{13} \\), \\( QR = 3\\sqrt{13} \\), and \\( RP = 13 \\). I notice that \\( RP = 13 \\) is the longest side, which likely makes it the hypotenuse. The other two sides, \\( PQ \\) and \\( QR \\), seem to be the legs of the triangle.\n\n**Check:**\nLet me quickly verify using the Pythagorean theorem to ensure these side lengths form a right triangle:\n\\[\n(2\\sqrt{13})^2 + (3\\sqrt{13})^2 = 4 \\times 13 + 9 \\times 13 = 52 + 117 = 169 = 13^2\n\\]\nThis checks out, as \\( 169 = 169 \\). So, the side lengths are consistent with a right-angled triangle.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Identifying Base and Height\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIn a right-angled triangle, the legs are perpendicular to each other and can be considered the base and height for area calculation. I need to identify which sides correspond to base and height.\n\n**Reflection:**\nTypically, in coordinate geometry problems, the legs are aligned with the axes. Given that \\( PQ \\) and \\( QR \\) are not aligned with the x or y axes but \\( RP \\) is the longest side, perhaps \\( PQ \\) and \\( QR \\) are the legs, with \\( QR \\) being vertical and \\( RP \\) being horizontal.\n\n**Check:**\nLet me look at the coordinates:\n- \\( P(0, 5) \\)\n- \\( Q(6, 9) \\)\n- \\( R(12, 0) \\)\n\nIt seems that \\( QR \\) has a vertical component (change in y), and \\( RP \\) has a horizontal component (change in x). This suggests that \\( QR \\) is vertical and \\( RP \\) is horizontal, making \\( PQ \\) the hypotenuse.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSo, I'd take \\( QR \\) as the height and \\( RP \\) as the base.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the Area of the Triangle\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have identified the base and height, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\nHere, base \\( RP = 13 \\) and height \\( QR = 3\\sqrt{13} \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 13 \\times 3\\sqrt{13} = \\frac{39\\sqrt{13}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Let me quickly check if the dimensions align. The base is \\( 13 \\), and the height is \\( 3\\sqrt{13} \\). Since \\( \\sqrt{13} \\approx 3.6 \\), the height is roughly \\( 3 \\times 3.6 = 10.8 \\), which seems reasonable for a triangle with these vertices.\n\n**Check:**\nTo ensure correctness, let\u2019s reassess:\n- The base \\( RP = 13 \\) is confirmed.\n- The height \\( QR = 3\\sqrt{13} \\) aligns with the vertical distance from \\( Q \\) to \\( R \\).\n\nThis checks out, so the area calculation seems correct.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Alternative Method \u2013 Area Using Determinants\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf I want to double-check my work, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices\u2019 coordinates:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n\\]\nLet\u2019s apply this to \\( P(0, 5) \\), \\( Q(6, 9) \\), and \\( R(12, 0) \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0(9 - 0) + 6(0 - 5) + 12(5 - 9) \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 - 30 - 48 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 78 = 39\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, I got an area of \\( 39 \\) using the determinant method, but earlier I got \\( \\frac{39\\sqrt{13}}{2} \\) using the base-height method. This discrepancy needs to be addressed.\n\n**Check:**\nLet\u2019s reexamine both methods to find the source of the inconsistency.\n\n1. **Base-Height Method:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 13 \\times 3\\sqrt{13} = \\frac{39\\sqrt{13}}{2} \\approx 139.3\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Determinant Method:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = 39\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\nThe area value from the determinant method seems more realistic because it's a whole number, while the base-height method's result involves an irrational number (\\( \\sqrt{13} \\)). Perhaps I mistook the height or base assignment earlier.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIt looks like I misidentified the legs of the triangle. Let me reassess which sides are the base and height.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Reassigning Base and Height\n\n**Thought Process:**\nGiven that the determinant method yielded a whole number area, it's likely that I misidentified the base and height. Let\u2019s reconsider which sides correspond to the base and height.\n\n**Reflection:**\nFrom the coordinates:\n- \\( P(0, 5) \\)\n- \\( Q(6, 9) \\)\n- \\( R(12, 0) \\)\n\nGiven the right angle between \\( PQ \\) and \\( QR \\), it makes sense for \\( PQ \\) to be the vertical leg and \\( QR \\) to be the horizontal leg.\n\n**Check:**\nLet\u2019s recalculate the lengths accordingly:\n- **\\( PQ \\):**\n  \\[\n  PQ = \\sqrt{(6 - 0)^2 + (9 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 16} = \\sqrt{52} = 2\\sqrt{13}\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\( QR \\):**\n  \\[\n  QR = \\sqrt{(12 - 6)^2 + (0 - 9)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 81} = \\sqrt{117} = 3\\sqrt{13}\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\( RP \\):**\n  \\[\n  RP = \\sqrt{(12 - 0)^2 + (0 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\n  \\]\n  \n**Conclusion:**\nSo, \\( PQ = 2\\sqrt{13} \\) is the vertical leg, and \\( QR = 3\\sqrt{13} \\) is the horizontal leg, with \\( RP = 13 \\) as the hypotenuse.\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Recalculating the Area with Correct Base and Height\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I\u2019ve correctly identified the base and height, I can recalculate the area using the base-height method.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3\\sqrt{13} \\times 2\\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{3 \\times 2 \\times 13}{2} = 39\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis matches the area obtained using the determinant method. It seems that assigning \\( PQ = 2\\sqrt{13} \\) and \\( QR = 3\\sqrt{13} \\) as the legs gives a consistent area.\n\n**Check:**\nLet me quickly verify:\n- Base \\( QR = 3\\sqrt{13} \\)\n- Height \\( PQ = 2\\sqrt{13} \\)\n- Hypotenuse \\( RP = 13 \\)\n\nCalculating area again:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3\\sqrt{13} \\times 2\\sqrt{13} = 39\n\\]\nThis confirms the area is \\( 39 \\).\n\n---\n\n## Step 8: Final Verification \u2013 Area Using Determinants\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure accuracy, let's reapply the determinant method to see if the area consistently yields \\( 39 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0(9 - 0) + 6(0 - 5) + 12(5 - 9) \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 - 30 - 48 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 78 = 39\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth methods now yield the same area of \\( 39 \\), confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Check:**\nThe steps align, and the calculations are consistent across both methods. The area of \\( \\triangle PQR \\) is indeed \\( 39 \\).\n\n---\n\n## Final Conclusion\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the right-angle property, I determined that the area of right-angled \\( \\triangle PQR \\) is \\( \\boxed{39} \\). Initially, there was a misidentification of the base and height, leading to inconsistent area values. However, upon reassessing and correctly assigning the legs of the triangle, both the base-height and determinant methods converged to the correct area. This process highlights the importance of verifying each step to ensure accuracy in geometric problems.",
