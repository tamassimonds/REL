    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking our work frequently, just like a human would naturally approach it.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**\"A line is described by the equation \\( y - 4 = 4(x - 8) \\). What is the sum of its \\( x \\)-intercept and \\( y \\)-intercept?\"**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \n- This looks like a linear equation, similar to the point-slope form I\u2019ve seen before.\n- I recall that finding intercepts involves determining where the line crosses the \\( x \\)-axis and \\( y \\)-axis.\n- The equation is set up like point-slope form, which makes me think I could possibly convert it to slope-intercept form to make things easier.\n- **\"But wait, is converting to slope-intercept really necessary? Maybe there's a more straightforward way.\"**\n  \n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Convert to Slope-Intercept Form:**  \n   - This might help me easily identify the \\( y \\)-intercept.\n   - Could then find the \\( x \\)-intercept by setting \\( y = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Directly Find Both Intercepts from the Given Equation:**  \n   - Since the equation is in a form related to intercepts, perhaps I can manipulate it directly to find both without converting completely.\n\n3. **Use Graphical Representation:**  \n   - If I sketch the line, the intercepts would be visible.\n   - **\"But sketching might be time-consuming and prone to errors for precise values.\"**\n\n4. **Check for Integer Intercepts:**  \n   - Given the numbers involved, maybe the intercepts are integers, which could simplify calculations.\n\n**Deciding on an Approach:**  \n- The first method seems standard and reliable.\n- However, considering that the equation is already in a form hinting at intercepts, perhaps the second method might be more efficient.\n- **\"Let\u2019s try finding intercepts directly from the given equation first and see how that goes.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the \\( y \\)-Intercept**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- The \\( y \\)-intercept is where the line crosses the \\( y \\)-axis, meaning \\( x = 0 \\).\n- **\"Wait, I need to determine \\( y \\) when \\( x = 0 \\). How can I use the given equation for that?\"**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven the equation:  \n\\[ y - 4 = 4(x - 8) \\]\n\n**Substitute \\( x = 0 \\):**  \n\\[ y - 4 = 4(0 - 8) \\]  \n\\[ y - 4 = 4 \\times -8 \\]  \n\\[ y - 4 = -32 \\]  \n\\[ y = -32 + 4 \\]  \n\\[ y = -28 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **\"Alright, so the \\( y \\)-intercept is \\( -28 \\). That seems straightforward.\"**\n- **\"Let me quickly double-check the math: \\( 4 \\times -8 = -32 \\), and \\( -32 + 4 = -28 \\). Yes, that\u2019s correct.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the \\( x \\)-Intercept**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- The \\( x \\)-intercept is where the line crosses the \\( x \\)-axis, meaning \\( y = 0 \\).\n- **\"I need to find \\( x \\) when \\( y = 0 \\). How can I manipulate the equation for that?\"**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nAgain, using the original equation:  \n\\[ y - 4 = 4(x - 8) \\]\n\n**Substitute \\( y = 0 \\):**  \n\\[ 0 - 4 = 4(x - 8) \\]  \n\\[ -4 = 4(x - 8) \\]  \n\\[ -4 = 4x - 32 \\]  \n\\[ 4x = -4 + 32 \\]  \n\\[ 4x = 28 \\]  \n\\[ x = \\frac{28}{4} \\]  \n\\[ x = 7 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **\"So, the \\( x \\)-intercept is at \\( x = 7 \\). That makes sense.\"**\n- **\"Checking the math: \\( 4x = -4 + 32 \\) simplifies to \\( 4x = 28 \\), and dividing by 4 gives \\( x = 7 \\). Correct.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Sum of the Intercepts**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Now that I have both intercepts, adding them together should give the required sum.\n- **\"Just adding \\( x \\)-intercept and \\( y \\)-intercept should work. Let\u2019s do that.\"**\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ \\text{Sum} = x\\text{-intercept} + y\\text{-intercept} = 7 + (-28) = 7 - 28 = -21 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **\"So the sum of the intercepts is \\( -21 \\). That seems straightforward.\"**\n- **\"Let me quickly verify: \\( 7 + (-28) = 7 - 28 \\), which correctly gives \\( -21 \\). It checks out.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Checking the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **\"Does this method make sense? Could there be a mistake?\"**\n- **\"I directly substituted into the original equation for both intercepts, which aligns with how intercepts are defined.\"**\n- **\"Since the calculations are straightforward, and the numbers check out, I feel confident about the answer.\"**\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- **\"Does the \\( y \\)-intercept make sense numerically? \\( -28 \\) seems reasonable compared to the points in the equation.\"**\n- **\"The \\( x \\)-intercept \\( 7 \\) also aligns with the adjustments from \\( x - 8 \\).\"**\n- **\"No discrepancies noted.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Converting to Slope-Intercept Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **\"Just to ensure accuracy, let\u2019s see if converting the equation to slope-intercept form (\\( y = mx + b \\)) gives the same intercepts.\"**\n- **\"This might serve as a double-check.\"**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nStarting with:  \n\\[ y - 4 = 4(x - 8) \\]\n\n**Expand the equation:**  \n\\[ y - 4 = 4x - 32 \\]  \n\n**Add 4 to both sides:**  \n\\[ y = 4x - 28 \\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **\"In slope-intercept form, the \\( y \\)-intercept is clearly \\( -28 \\), which matches our earlier result.\"**\n- **\"This confirms the \\( x \\)-intercept: setting \\( y = 0 \\) gives \\( 0 = 4x - 28 \\) \u21d2 \\( 4x = 28 \\) \u21d2 \\( x = 7 \\).\"**\n- **\"Both intercepts align with the direct method.\"**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **\"Using both methods, I arrive at the same intercepts and therefore the same sum.\"**\n- **\"This reassures me that the initial approach was correct.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying the Sum**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **\"Am I sure about the sum being \\( -21 \\)? Let me reflect again.\"**\n- **\"Adding \\( 7 \\) and \\( -28 \\) gives \\( -21 \\), which makes sense in this context.\"**\n- **\"There doesn't seem to be any error here.\"**\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \n- **\"The problem was approached systematically, with checks in place ensuring correctness.\"**\n- **\"Both methods yielded the same results, reinforcing the validity of the answer.\"**\n- **\"The sum of the \\( x \\)-intercept and \\( y \\)-intercept is indeed \\( -21 \\).\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\\[ \\boxed{-21} \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nIn tackling this problem, I began by brainstorming various strategies to find both the \\( x \\)- and \\( y \\)-intercepts directly from the given equation. By substituting appropriate values into the original equation, I successfully determined the intercepts as \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( y = -28 \\). Adding these together yielded the sum of \\( -21 \\).\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I also explored converting the equation to slope-intercept form, which confirmed the same intercept values. Regular reflections and quick checks throughout the process ensured that each step was correct, leading to a confident and verified solution.",
