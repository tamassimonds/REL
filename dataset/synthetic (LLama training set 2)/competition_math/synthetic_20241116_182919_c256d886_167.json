    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:  \n**Find the value of \\( x \\) such that \\( \\sqrt{3x + 7} = 10 \\).**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  This reminds me of dealing with square roots\u2014like when I have to eliminate the square root to solve for \\( x \\). I think I've done similar problems before, where squaring both sides is a common step. But let me brainstorm a bit to see if there are any other strategies I can think of.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Square Both Sides:**  \n     This seems like the most straightforward approach. Squaring both sides would eliminate the square root.\n  \n  2. **Graphical Approach:**  \n     Maybe I could graph \\( y = \\sqrt{3x + 7} \\) and \\( y = 10 \\) and see where they intersect.\n\n  3. **Algebraic Manipulation:**  \n     Perhaps I could manipulate the equation differently, but honestly, nothing else comes to mind right now.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  The simplest and most direct method seems to be squaring both sides. Let me start with that and see where it leads. If it gets messy or doesn't make sense, I can always reconsider my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Square Both Sides**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, squaring both sides should eliminate the square root. Let's do that and see what equation I get.\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{3x + 7})^2 = 10^2\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n3x + 7 = 100\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, that was straightforward. But let me double-check: squaring a square root should give me the expression inside, and squaring 10 is definitely 100. Seems correct so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to isolate \\( x \\). I'll subtract 7 from both sides to get rid of the constant.\n\n\\[\n3x + 7 - 7 = 100 - 7\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n3x = 93\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, that makes sense. Now, to solve for \\( x \\), I need to divide both sides by 3.\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{93}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\nx = 31\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me quickly check if this value makes the original equation true.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3(31) + 7} = \\sqrt{93 + 7} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nYes, that checks out. \\( \\sqrt{100} \\) is indeed 10, which satisfies the original equation. So, \\( x = 31 \\) seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Consider Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAlthough squaring both sides worked perfectly here, I remembered that sometimes squaring can introduce extraneous solutions, especially in more complex equations. But since this was straightforward, I think we're good. Still, to be thorough, let's consider another method just to be sure.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy:**  \n  **Graphical Approach:**  \n  If I were to graph \\( y = \\sqrt{3x + 7} \\) and \\( y = 10 \\), the intersection point would give me the solution for \\( x \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBut honestly, graphing seems like overkill for this problem, especially since we've already solved it algebraically and verified the solution.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet's stick with the algebraic method since it's simpler and more efficient for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore wrapping up, let's do a final check to ensure everything aligns.\n\n- **Original Equation:**  \n  \\( \\sqrt{3x + 7} = 10 \\)\n\n- **Solution Found:**  \n  \\( x = 31 \\)\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  Plugging \\( x = 31 \\) back into the original equation:\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{3(31) + 7} = \\sqrt{93 + 7} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nThe verification confirms that \\( x = 31 \\) satisfies the original equation. No extraneous solutions here since the steps were straightforward, and the checks align perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and consistently checking the work, we've successfully determined that the value of \\( x \\) is **31**. Initially considering various approaches like squaring both sides and graphing, the algebraic method proved to be the most efficient. Throughout the process, continuous verification ensured the correctness of the solution.",
