    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like I would if I were working through it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the expression \\(\\frac{6! + 4!}{5!}\\), several things come to mind:\n\n1. **Factorials Involved:** I recall that factorials (\\(!\\)) represent the product of all positive integers up to a certain number. So, \\(6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\), and similarly for \\(5!\\) and \\(4!\\).\n\n2. **Simplification Potential:** It seems like there might be a way to simplify the expression by canceling out common factors in the numerator and denominator.\n\n3. **Mixed Number Conversion:** The final answer needs to be expressed as a mixed number, which means I should end up with a whole part and a fractional part. This suggests that the result might not be an integer.\n\nInitially, I'm leaning towards simplifying the factorials first to see if that leads me in the right direction. But I'm open to exploring other strategies if this doesn't seem effective.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Expand Factorials Completely:** This would involve calculating each factorial value and then performing the addition and division.\n\n2. **Use Factorial Properties to Simplify:** Perhaps there's a property of factorials that allows for cancellation before expanding fully.\n\n3. **Express in Terms of \\(n!\\) Where Possible:** Maybe expressing everything in terms of the largest factorial (\\(6!\\) in this case) could simplify the expression.\n\nLet me start with the first strategy\u2014expanding the factorials completely\u2014to see how it looks. If it's too cumbersome or doesn't lead to a clean answer, I'll consider switching to another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expanding Factorials**\n\nLet's expand each factorial in the expression:\n\n\\[\n6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting these values back into the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6! + 4!}{5!} = \\frac{720 + 24}{120} = \\frac{744}{120}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** At this point, I've simplified the expression to \\(\\frac{744}{120}\\). However, I notice that both the numerator and denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which would make simplifying it easier before converting to a mixed number.\n\nBut let's proceed with this simplification and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Fraction \\(\\frac{744}{120}\\)**\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{744}{120}\\), I need to find the GCD of 744 and 120.\n\n**Calculating GCD:**\n\n- Factors of 744: \\(744 = 6 \\times 124 = 6 \\times 4 \\times 31 = 2^4 \\times 3 \\times 13\\)\n- Factors of 120: \\(120 = 12 \\times 10 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)\n\nCommon factors:\n- \\(2^3\\) and \\(2^4\\): common is \\(2^3\\)\n- 3 is a common factor in both\n\nSo, the GCD is \\(2^3 \\times 3 = 8 \\times 3 = 24\\).\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{744 \\div 24}{120 \\div 24} = \\frac{31}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a second, let me double-check the GCD calculation. If I divide both numerator and denominator by 24, I get \\(\\frac{31}{5}\\). This seems correct, but let's verify by multiplying back.\n\n\\[\n31 \\times 24 = 744 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 5 \\times 24 = 120\n\\]\n\nYes, the multiplication checks out. So, \\(\\frac{31}{5}\\) is indeed the simplified form.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Converting \\(\\frac{31}{5}\\) to a Mixed Number**\n\nTo express \\(\\frac{31}{5}\\) as a mixed number, I need to divide 31 by 5:\n\n\\[\n31 \\div 5 = 6 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of} \\quad 31 - (5 \\times 6) = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{31}{5} = 6 \\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\n**Reflection:** This makes sense. The whole number part is 6, and the fractional part is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\). I should double-check to ensure no errors occurred during division.\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 6 = 30 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 31 - 30 = 1\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out, so the mixed number is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Final Answer**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's quickly verify the entire process:\n\n- **Factorial Expansion:** Correct calculations for \\(6!\\), \\(5!\\), and \\(4!\\).\n- **Fraction Simplification:** Correct GCD calculation leading to \\(\\frac{31}{5}\\).\n- **Mixed Number Conversion:** Correct division resulting in \\(6 \\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\nEverything aligns, and the steps logically flow from one to the next.\n\n**Potential Alternative Strategy:** I could have also simplified the original expression by factoring out common terms before expanding. This might have been more efficient but wasn't necessary given the straightforward path taken.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully walking through each step, checking calculations, and ensuring each part makes sense, the expression \\(\\frac{6! + 4!}{5!}\\) as a mixed number is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** By brainstorming various strategies, starting with expanding factorials, simplifying the fraction, and converting it into a mixed number, I've arrived at the correct answer. Throughout the process, reflecting and verifying each step ensured accuracy and helped catch any potential mistakes early on.",
