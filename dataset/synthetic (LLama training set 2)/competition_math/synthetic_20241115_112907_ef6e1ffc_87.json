Using the divisibility rule helped me double-check** that 2003 is not divisible by 11, thus validating our remainder.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Breakdown Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Let's decompose 2003** to see if handling smaller numbers makes the division clearer.\n\n**Breaking Down 2003:**\n\\[\n2003 = 2000 + 3\n\\]\n\n**Calculating Each Part Modulo 11:**\n1. **2000 mod 11:**\n   \\[\n   2000 \\div 11 = 181 \\quad \\text{(whole number part)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   11 \\times 181 = 1991\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2000 - 1991 = 9\n   \\]\n   \n2. **3 mod 11:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\div 11 = 0 \\quad \\text{(whole number part)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 - 0 = 3\n   \\]\n\n**Combining the Results:**\n\\[\n(2000 \\mod 11) + (3 \\mod 11) = 9 + 3 = 12\n\\]\n\\[\n12 \\div 11 = 1 \\quad \\text{(whole number part)}\n\\]\n\\[\n12 - 11 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Final remainder is 1,** consistent with our earlier methods.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **This method also works.** By breaking down the number into smaller parts, we arrive at the same remainder.\n- **Ah, breaking it down helped reinforce the result** and provided an alternative verification path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Estimation to Quick Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Before finalizing, let's estimate** to ensure our calculations make sense.\n\n**Estimating 2003 Divided by 11:**\n\\[\n2000 \\div 11 \\approx 181.82\n\\]\n- **Whole number part:** 181\n- **Estimated remainder:** \n  \\[\n  2000 - (11 \\times 181) = 2000 - 1991 = 9\n  \\]\n  \n**Adding the Small Part (3):**\n\\[\n9 + 3 = 12\n\\]\n\\[\n12 \\div 11 = 1 \\quad \\text{(whole number part)}\n\\]\n\\[\n12 - 11 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Estimated remainder is 1,** matching our calculated results.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Estimation confirms accuracy.** It aligns with our detailed calculations.\n- **Always good to have a quick check** to validate the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **All methods agree:** The remainder when 2003 is divided by 11 is **1**.\n- **Multiple strategies confirm the result:** Direct division, modulus operation, divisibility rules, breakdown approach, and estimation all lead to the same conclusion.\n- **Reflecting on the process:** Exploring different strategies ensured accuracy and provided a comprehensive understanding of the problem.\n\n**Thinking Again:**\n- **Wait, is there any other method I missed?** I believe we've covered the main approaches, and each has consistently led us to the remainder of 1.\n- **Is the answer reasonable?** Yes, the calculations make sense, and the consistency across multiple methods supports the correctness.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **Random Insight:** Since 2003 is close to 2000, and 2000 mod 11 is 9, adding the small part (3) and handling it mod 11 also brings us back to a remainder of 1.\n- **That feels right.** The remainder aligns with both direct calculations and alternative approaches.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:** The remainder when 2003 is divided by 11 is **1**.\n\nFeel free to ask if there's anything else you'd like to explore!",
