    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's start by really understanding what's being asked.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I notice a few key details:\n\n- **Dimensions:** There's a rectangular piece of plywood measuring \\(4\\) feet by \\(8\\) feet.\n- **Goal:** Cut this into \\(4\\) congruent rectangles with no wood left over.\n- **Objective:** Find the positive difference between the greatest and least possible perimeter of a single piece.\n\nInitially, I think this is a problem about dividing a rectangle into smaller rectangles and calculating the perimeters of those smaller rectangles. It reminds me of geometry problems involving partitions and perimeters.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how to proceed. Maybe I should consider different ways to divide the original rectangle and see how that affects the perimeter.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Determine Different Cutting Methods:**\n   - Divide the rectangle lengthwise (parallel to the \\(8\\)-foot side).\n   - Divide the rectangle widthwise (parallel to the \\(4\\)-foot side).\n   - Combine both methods to see various configurations.\n\n2. **Calculate Perimeters for Each Method:**\n   - After dividing, calculate the perimeter of each resulting rectangle.\n   - Identify the maximum and minimum perimeters among these.\n\n3. **Verify if All Cuts Yield Congruent Rectangles:**\n   - Ensure that each cutting method produces congruent rectangles as stated in the problem.\n\nHmm, I think starting with determining the cutting methods makes sense. If I can visualize how the rectangle can be divided, calculating the perimeters should follow naturally.\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Different Cutting Methods**\n\n#### **Method 1: Lengthwise Division**\n\n- **Idea:** Divide the \\(8\\)-foot side into \\(4\\) equal parts.\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Width of each rectangle} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Height remains} = 4 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n  \nSo, each rectangle would be \\(2\\) feet by \\(4\\) feet.\n\n**Perimeter Calculation:**\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) = 2 \\times (2 + 4) = 12 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nWait a moment, that seems straightforward. But I should check if there are other methods that could yield different perimeters.\n\n#### **Method 2: Widthwise Division**\n\n- **Idea:** Divide the \\(4\\)-foot side into \\(4\\) equal parts.\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Width of each rectangle} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1 \\text{ foot}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Height remains} = 8 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n  \nSo, each rectangle would be \\(1\\) foot by \\(8\\) feet.\n\n**Perimeter Calculation:**\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (1 + 8) = 18 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nHmm, this gives a larger perimeter. It seems like dividing along the longer side yields a larger perimeter.\n\n#### **Method 3: Combining Both Lengthwise and Widthwise Divisions**\n\n- **Idea:** Divide both the \\(4\\)-foot and \\(8\\)-foot sides into \\(2\\) equal parts, creating \\(4\\) rectangles.\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Each rectangle} = \\frac{8}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{2} = 4 \\text{ feet by } 2 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n  \n**Perimeter Calculation:**\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (4 + 2) = 12 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, this is the same perimeter as Method 1. Maybe dividing both sides equally doesn't change the perimeter compared to just dividing one side.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Maximum and Minimum Perimeters**\n\nFrom the three methods:\n\n- **Method 1 & 3:** Perimeter is \\(12\\) feet.\n- **Method 2:** Perimeter is \\(18\\) feet.\n\nSo, the greatest possible perimeter is \\(18\\) feet, and the least possible perimeter is \\(12\\) feet.\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[\n18 - 12 = 6 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because dividing the rectangle along the longer side (Method 2) yields the largest perimeter, while dividing along the shorter side (or both) yields a smaller perimeter.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying Congruency of Rectangles**\n\nThe problem states that all resulting rectangles must be congruent. Let's ensure that our cutting methods achieve this:\n\n- **Method 1:** Each rectangle is \\(2\\) by \\(4\\) feet, congruent as all have the same dimensions.\n- **Method 2:** Each rectangle is \\(1\\) by \\(8\\) feet, also congruent.\n- **Method 3:** Each rectangle is \\(4\\) by \\(2\\) feet, which is the same as \\(2\\) by \\(4\\) feet, so still congruent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll methods produce congruent rectangles as required.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Consistency:** The perimeters calculated are consistent across methods.\n- **Congruency:** All rectangles are congruent as per the problem's requirement.\n- **Correctness:** The approach seems correct because dividing the rectangle along different sides logically affects the perimeter.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe positive difference between the greatest and least possible perimeter of a single piece is **6 feet**.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy exploring different cutting methods and calculating the corresponding perimeters, I was able to identify the maximum and minimum perimeters. Reflecting and checking at each step ensured the approach was correct and aligned with the problem's requirements. It also helped catch any inconsistencies or errors early on, leading to a reliable final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "There are four possible ways the plywood can be cut: all the cuts are parallel to the length, all the cuts are parallel to the width, one cut is parallel to the length and one parallel to the width, or two cuts are parallel to the width and one is parallel to the length. In the first way, the congruent rectangles have dimensions $2\\times4$, for a perimeter of $2+2+4+4=12$ feet. In the second way, the congruent rectangles have dimensions $1\\times8$, for a perimeter of $1+1+8+8=18$ feet. In the third and fourth ways, the rectangles have dimensions $2\\times4$, for a perimeter of 12 feet. The positive difference between the greatest perimeter and the least is $18-12=\\boxed{6}$ feet."
