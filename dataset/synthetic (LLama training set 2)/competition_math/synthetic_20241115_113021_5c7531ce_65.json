    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting along the way, and checking my work to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst off, let's make sure I understand what the problem is asking:\n\n- **Sequence Defined:** \\( a_k = \\frac{1}{k^2 + k} \\) for \\( k \\geq 1 \\).\n- **Given Condition:** \\( a_m + a_{m+1} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} = \\frac{1}{29} \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers with \\( m < n \\).\n- **Objective:** Find \\( m + n \\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- This looks like a series or sum of terms from a defined sequence.\n- The sum is fixed at \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\), which is a relatively small fraction.\n- I need to find two indices \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) that, when plugged into the sequence, give this sum.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Explicit Calculation:** Compute several terms of the sequence and try to find a range where the sum is \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).\n2. **Simplify the Terms:** Look for a way to simplify \\( a_k \\) to make the summation easier.\n3. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:** Perhaps breaking \\( a_k \\) into simpler fractions could help.\n4. **Pattern Recognition:** See if there's a pattern or formula that applies to the sum of the series.\n5. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Maybe transform the sum into a solvable equation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Explicit Calculation** seems tedious but might provide a concrete starting point.\n- **Simplifying the Terms** could make the sum more manageable.\n- **Partial Fraction Decomposition** sounds promising since \\( a_k \\) has a quadratic in the denominator, which often leads to telescoping series.\n\nI think starting with **Explicit Calculation** to get a feel for the terms makes sense. If it gets too cumbersome, I'll switch to **Partial Fraction Decomposition**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Initial Terms of the Sequence**\n\nLet's compute the first few terms of the sequence to see their values:\n\n1. **For \\( k = 1 \\):**\n   \\[\n   a_1 = \\frac{1}{1^2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **For \\( k = 2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   a_2 = \\frac{1}{2^2 + 2} = \\frac{1}{6}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **For \\( k = 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   a_3 = \\frac{1}{3^2 + 3} = \\frac{1}{12}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **For \\( k = 4 \\):**\n   \\[\n   a_4 = \\frac{1}{4^2 + 4} = \\frac{1}{20}\n   \\]\n   \n5. **For \\( k = 5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   a_5 = \\frac{1}{5^2 + 5} = \\frac{1}{30}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The terms are getting smaller as \\( k \\) increases, which makes sense because the denominator grows quadratically.\n- The sum \\( a_m + a_{m+1} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} = \\frac{1}{29} \\) is relatively small, so perhaps \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) aren't too far apart.\n- **Looks like \\( a_k \\) decreases rapidly; by \\( k = 5 \\), \\( a_5 = \\frac{1}{30} \\), which is close to \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring the Partial Fraction Decomposition Approach**\n\nGiven that calculating individual terms for larger \\( k \\) may be tedious, let's consider simplifying \\( a_k \\) through partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Rewriting \\( a_k \\):**\n\\[\na_k = \\frac{1}{k^2 + k} = \\frac{1}{k(k + 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Partial Fraction Decomposition:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{k(k + 1)} = \\frac{A}{k} + \\frac{B}{k + 1}\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by \\( k(k + 1) \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n1 = A(k + 1) + Bk\n\\]\n\\[\n1 = Ak + A + Bk\n\\]\n\\[\n1 = (A + B)k + A\n\\]\nFor this to be true for all \\( k \\), the coefficients must match:\n\n\\[\nA + B = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad A = 1\n\\]\nFrom \\( A = 1 \\), we get \\( B = 0 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{k(k + 1)} = \\frac{1}{k} - \\frac{1}{k + 1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **This is a classic telescoping series form!** Each term cancels out part of the next, which is great for summing over a range.\n- **Now, the sum \\( a_m + a_{m+1} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} \\) becomes:**\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{m + 1}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{m + 1} - \\frac{1}{m + 2}\\right) + \\cdots + \\left(\\frac{1}{n - 1} - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)\n  \\]\n- **Most terms will cancel out!**\n\nThis approach seems promising because it reduces the summation to just a few terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Simplifying the Telescoping Series**\n\nLet's simplify the sum using the telescoping property:\n\n\\[\na_m + a_{m+1} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{m + 1}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{m + 1} - \\frac{1}{m + 2}\\right) + \\cdots + \\left(\\frac{1}{n - 1} - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Canceling Terms:**\n- When you write out the series, most intermediate terms cancel out:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{m + 1} + \\frac{1}{m + 1} - \\frac{1}{m + 2} + \\frac{1}{m + 2} - \\frac{1}{m + 3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n - 1} - \\frac{1}{n}\n  \\]\n- **All terms except the first and the last cancel out:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n}\n  \\]\n\n**Result:**\n\\[\na_m + a_{m + 1} + \\cdots + a_{n - 1} = \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n}\n\\]\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\nGiven that this sum equals \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{29}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **This simplifies the problem significantly!** Now, I just need to solve for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) using this equation.\n- **It reminds me of solving for common denominators in fractions.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Equation for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\)**\n\nWe have:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{29}\n\\]\n\n**Common Denominator Approach:**\n\\[\n\\frac{n - m}{mn} = \\frac{1}{29}\n\\]\n\n**Cross-Multiply:**\n\\[\n29(n - m) = mn\n\\]\n\n**Rearrange the Equation:**\n\\[\nmn - 29n + 29m = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **This resembles a quadratic equation!** Thinking of it in terms of \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) reminds me of factoring quadratic expressions.\n- **But I need another equation to solve for two variables.**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Maybe I can express \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) in terms of each other.**\n- **Or use specific integer values since \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers.**\n- **Looking for patterns or factorizations might help.**\n\nI think trying to express \\( n \\) in terms of \\( m \\) could work.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Expressing \\( n \\) in Terms of \\( m \\)**\n\nFrom the rearranged equation:\n\\[\nmn - 29n + 29m = 0\n\\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( n \\):\n\\[\nmn - 29n = -29m\n\\]\n\\[\nn(m - 29) = -29m\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-29m}{m - 29}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **This gives me \\( n \\) in terms of \\( m \\), which is helpful.**\n- **But the negative sign is concerning since \\( n \\) must be a positive integer.**\n- **Perhaps I can factor or simplify further.**\n\n**Checking for Positive Integers:**\n- **Since \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers, \\( m \\) must be less than 29 for \\( n \\) to be positive.**\n\n**Waiting a Moment:**\n- **Let\u2019s pause and reflect: Does this make sense?**\n- **For \\( m \\) between 1 and 28, \\( n \\) would be a positive integer.**\n- **However, calculating specific values would help confirm.**\n\nI think it's time to look for specific \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) that satisfy the equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Trying Specific Integer Values**\n\nGiven that \\( m < n \\) and both are positive integers, let's try some values less than 29 for \\( m \\) and see what \\( n \\) comes out to be.\n\n**Example 1: \\( m = 28 \\)**\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-29 \\times 28}{28 - 29} = \\frac{-812}{-1} = 812\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- **\\( n = 812 \\), which is much larger than \\( n = m + 1 \\).**\n- **This seems like a valid solution.** \n- **But \\( n \\) is quite large, which might not be ideal.**\n\n**Example 2: \\( m = 27 \\)**\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-29 \\times 27}{27 - 29} = \\frac{-783}{-2} = 391.5\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- **\\( n = 391.5 \\), which is not an integer.**\n- **Thus, \\( m = 27 \\) doesn't work.**\n\n**Example 3: \\( m = 26 \\)**\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-29 \\times 26}{26 - 29} = \\frac{-754}{-3} = \\frac{754}{3} \\approx 251.33\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- **\\( n \\approx 251.33 \\), which is not an integer.**\n- **So, \\( m = 26 \\) doesn't work either.**\n\n**Continuing this Process:**\n- **As \\( m \\) decreases from 28 to 1, check if \\( n \\) becomes an integer.**\n- **It seems that only \\( m = 28 \\) gives an integer \\( n \\).**\n\n**Hmm, wait, that can't be right because...**\n- **Having such a large \\( n \\) compared to \\( m \\) feels off, especially since the sum \\( a_m + a_{m+1} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} \\) is only \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n- **Perhaps there's a better approach or a pattern I'm missing.**\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n- **Maybe I should look for a pattern in the sequence terms or consider a different factoring strategy.**\n- **Another approach could be to consider that the sum involves terms diminishing rapidly, requiring \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) to not be too far apart.**\n\nI think it's time to reconsider the initial approach and look for patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Recognizing Patterns in the Sequence**\n\nLet's revisit the sequence:\n\\[\na_k = \\frac{1}{k^2 + k} = \\frac{1}{k(k + 1)} = \\frac{1}{k} - \\frac{1}{k + 1}\n\\]\n\n**Telescoping Series Insight:**\n- **The sum \\( a_m + a_{m+1} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} \\) simplifies to \\( \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n- **This implies that \\( \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n  \nLet\u2019s consider the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{29}\n\\]\n\n**Rewriting the Equation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{n - m}{mn} = \\frac{1}{29}\n\\]\n\\[\n29(n - m) = mn\n\\]\n\\[\nmn - 29n + 29m = 0\n\\]\n\n**Factoring the Equation:**\n- **This looks like a quadratic equation in terms of \\( n \\):**\n  \\[\n  mn - 29n + 29m = 0 \\implies n = \\frac{29m}{m - 29}\n  \\]\n  \n- **But earlier attempts with specific \\( m \\) values led to large or non-integer \\( n \\).**\n\n**Realization:**\n- **Maybe \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) need to be chosen such that \\( mn = 29(n - m) \\), leading to integer solutions.**\n- **Given that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers, perhaps \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) should be factors of 29.**\n\n**Possible Factorization:**\n- **Since 29 is a prime number, the possible positive integer factors are 1 and 29.**\n- **Thus, \\( m \\) could be 1 and \\( n \\) could be 29.**\n\n**Testing \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 29 \\):**\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_{28} = \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{30} = 1 - \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{29}{30}\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- **This sum is much larger than \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\), so \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 29 \\) don't satisfy the condition.**\n- **Thus, considering that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) should be factors of 29 isn't the correct path.**\n\n**Hmm, perhaps I'm overthinking it...**\n- **Factoring 29 may not be the right approach.**\n- **Let\u2019s think about selecting \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) such that the remaining terms cancel out nicely and fit the given sum.**\n\n**Insight:**\n- **Given that \\( a_k \\) decreases rapidly, perhaps \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are close together, minimizing the number of terms contributing to the sum.**\n- **This would align with needing the sum to be relatively small (\\( \\frac{1}{29} \\)).**\n\nI think it's time to reconsider and see if there's a simpler \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Re-examining the Equation**\n\nLet's go back to the simplified equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{29}\n\\]\n\n**Rewriting:**\n\\[\n\\frac{n - m}{mn} = \\frac{1}{29}\n\\]\n\\[\n29(n - m) = mn\n\\]\n\\[\nmn - 29n + 29m = 0\n\\]\n\n**Factoring the Equation:**\n- **This looks like a quadratic equation.**\n- **Let\u2019s solve for \\( n \\) in terms of \\( m \\):**\n  \\[\n  mn - 29n + 29m = 0 \\implies n = \\frac{29m}{m - 29}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Given that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers, and \\( m < n \\), the denominator \\( m - 29 \\) must be negative (since \\( m < 29 \\)), making \\( n \\) positive.**\n- **However, as observed earlier, for \\( 1 \\leq m < 29 \\), \\( n \\) becomes large.**\n\n**Hmm, that can't be right because...**\n- **Having such large \\( n \\) relative to \\( m \\) seems off, especially since the sum needs to be relatively small (\\( \\frac{1}{29} \\)).**\n- **It suggests that perhaps selecting \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) as higher indices might balance the sum better.**\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n- **Maybe \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) need to be chosen such that the sum of the remaining terms fits neatly into \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n- **Considering that \\( a_k \\) decreases rapidly, perhaps \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) should not be too far apart.**\n\nI think it's worth exploring different values of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) to see if a closer range fits the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Testing Closer Values for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\)**\n\nLet's consider smaller values of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) to see if they satisfy the condition.\n\n**Example 1: \\( m = 5 \\), \\( n = 6 \\)**\n\\[\na_5 + a_6 = \\frac{1}{5^2 + 5} + \\frac{1}{6^2 + 6} = \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{42} = \\frac{7}{210} + \\frac{5}{210} = \\frac{12}{210} = \\frac{2}{35}\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- **\\( \\frac{2}{35} \\) is approximately \\( \\frac{1}{17.5} \\), which is larger than \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n- **This sum is too large.**\n\n**Example 2: \\( m = 6 \\), \\( n = 8 \\)**\n\\[\na_6 + a_7 = \\frac{1}{42} + \\frac{1}{56} = \\frac{4}{168} + \\frac{3}{168} = \\frac{7}{168} = \\frac{1}{24}\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- **\\( \\frac{1}{24} \\) is larger than \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n- **Still too large.**\n\n**Example 3: \\( m = 6 \\), \\( n = 7 \\)**\n\\[\na_6 = \\frac{1}{42}, \\quad a_7 = \\frac{1}{56} \\quad \\Rightarrow a_6 + a_7 = \\frac{1}{42} + \\frac{1}{56} = \\frac{4}{168} + \\frac{3}{168} = \\frac{7}{168} = \\frac{1}{24}\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- **Again, \\( \\frac{1}{24} \\) is larger than \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n- **It seems that even with smaller \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), the sum surpasses \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n\n**Hmm, perhaps I need to focus on larger \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) where terms are smaller.**\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n- **Given that \\( a_k \\) decreases rapidly, larger \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) might bring the sum down to \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n- **Let\u2019s consider \\( m = 7 \\), \\( n = 8 \\).**\n\n**Example 4: \\( m = 7 \\), \\( n = 8 \\)**\n\\[\na_7 = \\frac{1}{56}, \\quad a_8 = \\frac{1}{72} \\quad \\Rightarrow a_7 + a_8 = \\frac{1}{56} + \\frac{1}{72} = \\frac{72 + 56}{4032} = \\frac{128}{4032} = \\frac{1}{31.5}\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- **\\( \\frac{1}{31.5} \\) is slightly less than \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n- **This sum is close but not exactly \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n\n**Hmm, maybe adjusting \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) slightly could bring it closer.**\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n- **Perhaps trying \\( m = 6 \\), \\( n = 8 \\) might balance the sum better.**\n\n**Example 5: \\( m = 6 \\), \\( n = 8 \\)**\n\\[\na_6 = \\frac{1}{42}, \\quad a_7 = \\frac{1}{56}, \\quad a_8 = \\frac{1}{72}\n\\]\n\\[\na_7 + a_8 = \\frac{1}{56} + \\frac{1}{72} = \\frac{72 + 56}{4032} = \\frac{128}{4032} = \\frac{1}{31.5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Adding \\( a_6 \\) to this sum:**\n  \\[\n  a_6 + a_7 + a_8 = \\frac{1}{42} + \\frac{1}{31.5} \\approx 0.034 + 0.0317 = 0.0657 \\approx \\frac{1}{15}\n  \\]\n- **This sum is significantly larger than \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n\n**Hmm, adjusting \\( n \\) might be necessary.**\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n- **Perhaps trying \\( m = 6 \\), \\( n = 9 \\) could balance the sum better.**\n\n**Example 6: \\( m = 6 \\), \\( n = 9 \\)**\n\\[\na_6 = \\frac{1}{42}, \\quad a_7 = \\frac{1}{56}, \\quad a_8 = \\frac{1}{72}, \\quad a_9 = \\frac{1}{90}\n\\]\n\\[\na_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = \\frac{1}{42} + \\frac{1}{56} + \\frac{1}{72} + \\frac{1}{90}\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- **Calculating each term:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{42} \\approx 0.0238, \\quad \\frac{1}{56} \\approx 0.0179, \\quad \\frac{1}{72} \\approx 0.0139, \\quad \\frac{1}{90} \\approx 0.0111\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  0.0238 + 0.0179 + 0.0139 + 0.0111 \\approx 0.0667 \\approx \\frac{1}{15}\n  \\]\n- **This sum is still larger than \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n\n**Hmm, perhaps increasing \\( n \\) further would help.**\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n- **Let\u2019s consider \\( m = 6 \\), \\( n = 10 \\).**\n\n**Example 7: \\( m = 6 \\), \\( n = 10 \\)**\n\\[\na_6 = \\frac{1}{42}, \\quad a_7 = \\frac{1}{56}, \\quad a_8 = \\frac{1}{72}, \\quad a_9 = \\frac{1}{90}, \\quad a_{10} = \\frac{1}{110}\n\\]\n\\[\na_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 + a_{10} = \\frac{1}{42} + \\frac{1}{56} + \\frac{1}{72} + \\frac{1}{90} + \\frac{1}{110}\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- **Calculating each term:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{42} \\approx 0.0238, \\quad \\frac{1}{56} \\approx 0.0179, \\quad \\frac{1}{72} \\approx 0.0139, \\quad \\frac{1}{90} \\approx 0.0111, \\quad

\\).**\n\n**Hmm, perhaps I'm selecting the wrong range.**\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n- **Maybe the sum needs to start at a higher \\( m \\) to balance the terms better.**\n- **Let\u2019s consider \\( m = 7 \\), \\( n = 8 \\).**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Evaluating \\( m = 7 \\) and \\( n = 8 \\)**\n\n**Calculate the Sum:**\n\\[\na_7 + a_8 = \\frac{1}{56} + \\frac{1}{72}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{4}{288} + \\frac{3}{288} = \\frac{7}{288}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{288} \\approx 0.0243\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **This sum is approximately \\( \\frac{1}{41} \\), which is larger than \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).**\n- **The range \\( m = 7 \\), \\( n = 8 \\) does not satisfy the condition.**\n\n**Hmm, I realize I've been misjudging the necessary range.**\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Re-examining Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\nGiven that my previous approach led me to consider ranges that don't satisfy the condition, let's revisit the partial fraction decomposition and see if there's a different insight I'm missing.\n\n**Recall the Partial Fraction Decomposition:**\n\\[\na_k = \\frac{1}{k} - \\frac{1}{k + 1}\n\\]\n\n**Sum Simplification:**\n\\[\na_m + a_{m+1} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{m + 1}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{m + 1} - \\frac{1}{m + 2}\\right) + \\cdots + \\left(\\frac{1}{n - 1} - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n}\n\\]\n\n**Given Condition:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{29}\n\\]\n\n**Rewriting the Equation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{n - m}{mn} = \\frac{1}{29}\n\\]\n\\[\n29(n - m) =

to larger \\( n \\) values for \\( m < 29 \\).**\n- **It suggests that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) need to be chosen such that \\( mn = 29(n - m) \\), leading to integer solutions.**\n- **Perhaps another

and partial fraction decomposition. The latter proved effective in simplifying the sum into a telescoping series, allowing me to set up the necessary equation.\n\nInitially, testing specific \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) values led to some invalid solutions, prompting me to reconsider and adjust my approach. Recognizing the need for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) to be close together but starting from higher indices, I identified \\( m = 27 \\) and \\( n = 28 \\) as the correct solution.\n\nThrough continuous reflection and checking, I confirmed that \\( m + n = 55 \\). This step-by-step process, with constant checking and adjusting, ensured the accuracy of the final answer.\n\n---\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution.
