    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies and reflecting frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's see where this takes me, and I'll adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:  \n*A drawer contains 3 white balls and 6 black balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that both are white?*\n\nInitially, I think this is a probability question involving combinations. It reminds me of problems where you need to calculate the likelihood of drawing specific items from a mixed set. But I\u2019m not entirely sure about the best approach yet.\n\nPossible strategies that come to mind:\n\n1. **Basic Probability Approach:** Calculate the probability of drawing two white balls sequentially without replacement.\n2. **Combinatorial Method:** Use combinations to find the total ways to draw two balls and the favorable ways to draw two white balls.\n3. **Probability Tree:** Visualize the drawing process step by step to see all possible outcomes.\n\nI think the **Combinatorial Method** might be the most straightforward, but I'll explore each to see which feels right.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Basic Probability Approach**\n\n**Step 1:**  \nCalculate the probability of drawing a white ball on the first draw.\n\n- Total balls = 3 white + 6 black = 9 balls\n- Probability of drawing a white ball first =  \n  \\[ \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\n**Step 2:**  \nIf the first ball drawn is white, there are now 2 white balls left and 8 total balls.\n\n- Probability of drawing a second white ball =  \n  \\[ \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\n**Step 3:**  \nMultiply the probabilities of both steps to get the combined probability.\n\n- Combined probability =  \n  \\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{12} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute. This approach assumes drawing without considering the total number of possible combinations. Maybe there's a mistake here because it doesn't account for all possible ways to draw two balls. Let me double-check.\n\nAh, I see the issue. This method only considers one specific sequence (first and second draws both being white) and doesn't account for other combinations where both balls could be white regardless of the order. So, I think I need to reconsider this strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Combinatorial Method**\n\n**Step 1:**  \nCalculate the total number of ways to draw two balls from nine.\n\n- Total balls = 9  \n- Number of ways to draw 2 balls =  \n  \\[ \\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2 \\times 1} = 36 \\]\n\n**Step 2:**  \nCalculate the number of favorable ways to draw two white balls.\n\n- White balls = 3  \n- Number of ways to draw 2 white balls =  \n  \\[ \\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2 \\times 1} = 3 \\]\n\n**Step 3:**  \nCompute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total outcomes.\n\n- Probability =  \n  \\[ \\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, interesting. This method gives the same probability as the first strategy, \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\). But I feel more confident with this approach because it considers all possible combinations without assuming a specific sequence. It seems more comprehensive.\n\nBut let me check if this aligns with another method just to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Probability Tree**\n\n**Step 1:**  \nVisualize the drawing process with a tree diagram.\n\n- **First Draw:**  \n  - Probability of drawing a white ball = \\(\\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)  \n  - Probability of drawing a black ball = \\(\\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n- **Second Draw (if first was white):**  \n  - Probability of drawing a white ball again = \\(\\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\\)  \n  - Probability of drawing a black ball = \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\n- **Second Draw (if first was black):**  \n  - Probability of drawing a white ball = \\(\\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{3}{8}\\)  \n  - Probability of drawing a black ball = \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)\n\n**Step 2:**  \nCalculate the probability of both balls being white using paths in the tree.\n\n- Path 1: White first, white second =  \n  \\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{12} \\]\n\n- Path 2: Black first, white second =  \n  \\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{12} \\]\n\nOh wait, I'm looking for the probability where **both** balls are white, so I should only consider Path 1.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis tree method also confirms the probability as \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\). I appreciate that it visualizes the different paths, but it's more complex than the combinatorial method for this particular problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\nAll three strategies\u2014Basic Probability, Combinatorial Method, and Probability Tree\u2014arrived at the same probability of \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\). I feel confident that this is correct, especially since the Combinatorial Method provided a clear and direct calculation.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) make sense?  \n- With only 3 white balls out of 9, drawing two white balls seems relatively rare.\n- Considering the total combinations (36) and the favorable ones (3), \\(\\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}\\) feels reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies, I was able to confirm the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\). Initially, the Basic Probability Approach seemed too simplistic and overlooked the total combination aspect, leading to confusion. Reflecting on this helped me realize the need for a more comprehensive method.\n\nThe Combinatorial Method provided the most straightforward path, and the Probability Tree validated the result through a different lens. Checking my work ensured consistency across methods, giving me confidence in the final answer.\n\nOverall, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their validity, and verifying through multiple approaches led to a correct and well-justified solution.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed, human-like thinking process helps in understanding how to tackle such probability problems step by step!",

  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ combinations of two balls that can be drawn.  There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ combinations of two white balls that can be drawn.  So the probability that two balls pulled out are both white is $\\dfrac{3}{36} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{12}}$."
