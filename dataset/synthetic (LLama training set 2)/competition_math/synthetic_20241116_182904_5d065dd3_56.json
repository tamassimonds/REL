    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to check if I\u2019m on the right path, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn\u2019t seem right. Here we go!\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem **\u201cWhat is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) divided by 3?\u201d**, I think:\n\n- **Fraction Division:** This reminds me of dividing fractions, but there\u2019s an integer involved too.\n- **Reciprocal Involved:** Maybe I need to use the reciprocal of 3 since dividing by a whole number often involves flipping it.\n- **Multiple Methods:** I recall that I could convert fractions to decimals or keep it in fractional form. I\u2019m not sure which is better yet.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Method 1:** Use the reciprocal of 3 and multiply.\n- **Method 2:** Convert \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) to a decimal and divide by 3.\n- **Method 3:** Keep it as a fraction and simplify if needed.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the reciprocal method because that\u2019s what I remember works for dividing fractions.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Fraction Division**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- When dividing by a number, I think about multiplying by its reciprocal.\n- For example, dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Exploring Method 1: Using Reciprocal**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\div 3 = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Multiply the numerators: \\( 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\)\n- Multiply the denominators: \\( 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{15}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Is \\( \\frac{2}{15} \\) reasonable?\n  - **Thought:** Dividing something into 3 parts should make each part smaller, so \\( \\frac{2}{15} \\) seems correct.\n- **Verification:** Multiplying back:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{15} \\times 3 = \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5}\n  \\]\n  - **Conclusion:** It checks out!\n\n### **Step 2: Alternative Method - Decimal Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Maybe converting to decimals could provide a different perspective.\n- I remember that converting \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) to a decimal is straightforward.\n\n**Exploring Method 2: Converting to Decimal**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} = 0.4\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n0.4 \\div 3 = \\frac{0.4}{3}\n\\]\n  \n**Performing the Division:**\n- Convert 0.4 to a fraction for easier division:\n  \\[\n  0.4 = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\n  \\]\n- Divide by 3:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{5} \\div 3 = \\frac{2}{15}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Did converting to decimal change the answer?\n  - **Thought:** Both methods lead to \\( \\frac{2}{15} \\), so it\u2019s consistent.\n- **Verification:** Multiplying back:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{15} \\times 3 = \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5}\n  \\]\n  - **Conclusion:** It matches!\n\n### **Step 3: Third Method - Keeping it as a Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let\u2019s try keeping the original fraction and see if simplifying works without converting.\n- This might provide a quicker way or confirm the other methods.\n\n**Exploring Method 3: Fraction Division Rules**\n\n**Understanding:**\n- **Rule:** When dividing fractions, multiply by the reciprocal.\n- This is essentially what we did in Method 1.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\div 3 = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{15}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Does this align with the other methods?\n  - **Thought:** Yes, all methods lead to \\( \\frac{2}{15} \\).\n- **Verification:** Multiplying back:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{15} \\times 3 = \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5}\n  \\]\n  - **Conclusion:** Consistency across methods confirms the correctness.\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Cross-Verification:** All three methods result in \\( \\frac{2}{15} \\).\n- **Reasonableness:** Dividing \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) by 3 logically leads to a smaller fraction, which fits.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\div 3 = \\frac{2}{15}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Mistake Check:** Initially, I considered converting to decimals, which worked, but it added an extra step. The reciprocal method was straightforward and aligned with the fraction division rule.\n- **Learning:** Multiple approaches confirm the answer\u2019s validity. It\u2019s always good to verify using different strategies.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- Taking the time to brainstorm and explore different methods ensured that the solution was correct.\n- Reflecting and checking after each step helped catch any potential errors early.\n- It\u2019s crucial to be flexible in approach and ready to change tactics if something doesn\u2019t feel right.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically exploring various strategies\u2014using the reciprocal, converting to decimals, and applying fraction division rules\u2014I confidently determined that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\div 3 = \\frac{2}{15}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, complete with reflections and checks, mirrors natural problem-solving, ensuring accuracy and understanding.",
