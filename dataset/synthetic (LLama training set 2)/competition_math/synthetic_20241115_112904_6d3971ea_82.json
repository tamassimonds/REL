    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle this problem step-by-step, thinking through each part as naturally as possible, just like how I'd approach it if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem is about finding the perimeter of a square given two adjacent vertices: \\((1, -2)\\) and \\((-4, 10)\\). \n\nWhen I first see this, I think:\n\n- **Squares have equal sides:** So all four sides are equal in length.\n- **Adjacent vertices:** This tells me that the two points given are next to each other, meaning they form one side of the square.\n- **Coordinates are given:** We\u2019re working in the Cartesian plane, so I\u2019ll likely need to use distance formulas or coordinate geometry concepts.\n\nBut honestly, **I'm not entirely sure where to start**. Maybe I need to find the distance between these two points first? That seems logical because knowing the length of one side would help in finding the perimeter.\n\n---\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculate the distance between the given points:**\n   - This would give me the length of the side of the square.\n\n2. **Check if the given points can form a square:**\n   - Ensure that the distance calculated makes sense within the context of a square.\n\n3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem:**\n   - Since these are adjacent vertices, maybe this theorem applies directly.\n\n4. **Consider rotation matrices or transformations:**\n   - But wait, that seems too complicated for just finding a perimeter.\n\n**Reflection:** \n- The first strategy\u2014calculating the distance\u2014seems the most straightforward. \n- **Wait**, let me think: Checking if the points can indeed form a square would be smart before moving too far. Maybe verifying that they\u2019re at right angles or something similar?\n\n**Decision:** \n- **I'll start by calculating the distance** between the points to see if it gives me a reasonable length for a side of a square.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Calculating the Distance Between the Points**\n\nTo find the length of the side of the square, I\u2019ll use the distance formula between two points in the Cartesian plane:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the given points:\n\n- \\( (x_1, y_1) = (1, -2) \\)\n- \\( (x_2, y_2) = (-4, 10) \\)\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{((-4) - 1)^2 + (10 - (-2))^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{(-5)^2 + (12)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{25 + 144}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{169}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 13\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts on This Step:**\n- **Okay, so the length of one side of the square is 13 units.** \n- **Does that make sense?** Yes, having a side length of 13 seems reasonable for a square in the Cartesian plane.\n  \n**Quick Check:** \n- **Rechecking the calculation:** \n  - \\((-4) - 1 = -5\\) \u2705 \n  - \\(10 - (-2) = 12\\) \u2705 \n  - Squaring these gives \\(25 + 144 = 169\\) \u2705 \n  - Taking the square root gives 13 \u2705\n  \n**Conclusion:** \n- **The distance calculation seems correct.** \n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Verifying the Shape is a Square**\n\nNow, just to be sure, **I should check if these points can indeed form a square.**\n\n- **Adjacent vertices:** Given, so it's one side of the square.\n- **Equal sides:** All sides should be equal, which we confirmed by calculating one.\n- **Right angles:** Since they\u2019re adjacent vertices, they should form a right angle.\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **But I only have two points.** Can I confirm right angles?\n\n**Idea:**\n- **Maybe think about the properties of squares:**\n  - Diagonals are equal and bisect each other.\n  - Since I only have one side, perhaps find the coordinates of the other two vertices?\n\n**Decision:**\n- **For now, let's proceed with the perimeter calculation based on the side length.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Perimeter of the Square**\n\nThe perimeter \\(P\\) of a square is the sum of all its sides:\n\n\\[\nP = 4 \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]\n\nGiven the side length is 13:\n\n\\[\nP = 4 \\times 13 = 52\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts on This Step:**\n- **That makes sense.** The perimeter is simply four times the side length.\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Does this align with what I expected?** \n  - Given a side length of 13, a perimeter of 52 feels correct.\n  \n**Quick Check:**\n- **Multiplication check:** \n  - \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\)\n  - \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\)\n  - \\(40 + 12 = 52\\) \u2705\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **The perimeter calculation is correct.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **The distance calculation provided a logical side length.**\n- **Assuming the shape is a square based on the given information, the perimeter was straightforward to calculate.**\n- **Everything checks out:**\n\n  - Distance between points: 13\n  - Perimeter: \\(4 \\times 13 = 52\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Initially, I wasn't sure how to start,** but calculating the distance between the points led me directly to the solution.\n- **Checking if the points can form a square** was important to ensure the validity of the perimeter calculation.\n- **Always good to double-check calculations** to confirm they make sense.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe perimeter of the square is **52 units**.",
