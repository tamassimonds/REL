    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it as I would naturally, thinking step-by-step, exploring different strategies, and checking my work along the way. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d tackle it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem is about a right triangle \\( ABC \\) with \\( \\angle B = 90^\\circ \\), and it says \\( \\sin A = 2\\cos A \\). I need to find \\( \\cos A \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Trigonometric Identities:** This looks like a trigonometric relationship I might be able to manipulate using basic identities.\n- **Right Triangle Properties:** Since it\u2019s a right triangle, maybe I can use the definitions of sine and cosine related to the triangle's sides.\n- **Quadratic Equations:** The equation \\( \\sin A = 2\\cos A \\) reminds me of relationships that might lead to a quadratic equation.\n- **Unit Circle Approach:** Perhaps considering angles and their sine and cosine values on the unit circle could help.\n\n**Uncertainty:**\nI\u2019m not entirely sure which method will be the most straightforward, so I\u2019ll start exploring and see where it takes me.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies:**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Using Trigonometric Identities**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I know that in any right triangle, \\( \\sin A = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} \\) and \\( \\cos A = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} \\).\n- Given \\( \\sin A = 2 \\cos A \\), maybe I can express both in terms of the triangle's sides.\n\n**Attempting This Strategy:**\n\n1. **Express \\( \\sin A \\) and \\( \\cos A \\) in terms of sides:**\n   - Let\u2019s say in triangle \\( ABC \\):\n     - \\( \\sin A = \\frac{a}{c} \\) where \\( a \\) is the side opposite angle \\( A \\), and \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse.\n     - \\( \\cos A = \\frac{b}{c} \\) where \\( b \\) is the side adjacent to angle \\( A \\).\n\n2. **Substitute into the given equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a}{c} = 2 \\times \\frac{b}{c}\n   \\]\n   - Simplifying this:\n   \\[\n   a = 2b\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n- This suggests that the side opposite angle \\( A \\) is twice the length of the adjacent side. \n- That feels like a plausible relationship.\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n- Wait, does this make sense in a right triangle? Let\u2019s think about it:\n  - If \\( a = 2b \\), then the triangle must have specific angle measures to satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n  - I\u2019ll need to verify if this leads to a valid triangle.\n\n**Potential Issue:**\n- But \\( \\sin A = 2 \\cos A \\) implies \\( \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} = 2 \\), which is \\( \\tan A = 2 \\).\n- So, perhaps there\u2019s a quicker way using \\( \\tan A \\) directly.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Using the Tangent Function**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- From the previous strategy, I realized \\( \\tan A = \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} = 2 \\).\n- Maybe focusing directly on the tangent relationship will be more efficient.\n\n**Proceeding with This Strategy:**\n\n1. **Set up the tangent equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\tan A = 2\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Recall the definition of tangent:**\n   \\[\n   \\tan A = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{a}{b}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **So, \\( a = 2b \\), matching our earlier finding.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This aligns with what I got in the first approach. It confirms that \\( a = 2b \\).\n\n**Checking the Consistency:**\n- Let\u2019s check if this can form a valid right triangle.\n- According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n  \\[\n  a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n  \\]\n  Substituting \\( a = 2b \\):\n  \\[\n  (2b)^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\implies 4b^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\implies 5b^2 = c^2 \\implies c = \\sqrt{5}b\n  \\]\n  \n**Conclusion So Far:**\n- The side lengths can be \\( a = 2b \\), \\( b = b \\), and \\( c = \\sqrt{5}b \\).\n- This satisfies the Pythagorean theorem, so it\u2019s a valid right triangle.\n\n**Realization:**\n- By knowing \\( \\tan A = 2 \\), I can now find \\( \\cos A \\) directly.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating \\( \\cos A \\):**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since \\( \\tan A = 2 \\), I can relate it to \\( \\sin A \\) and \\( \\cos A \\).\n- Recall that \\( \\tan A = \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} \\), and also use \\( \\sin^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1 \\).\n\n**Steps to Find \\( \\cos A \\):**\n\n1. **Express \\( \\sin A \\) and \\( \\cos A \\) in terms of \\( b \\):**\n   - From \\( a = 2b \\) and \\( c = \\sqrt{5}b \\):\n     \\[\n     \\sin A = \\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{2b}{\\sqrt{5}b} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\cos A = \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{5}b} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Verification:**\n   - Check if \\( \\sin^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{25} + \\frac{5}{25} = \\frac{20}{25} + \\frac{5}{25} = \\frac{25}{25} = 1\n     \\]\n   - This confirms that the values are consistent.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The calculations align with the Pythagorean identity, so the values are correct.\n\n**Checking for Simplification:**\n- \\( \\cos A = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\) simplifies to \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\), which is a standard trigonometric value.\n\n**Final Verification:**\n- Given \\( \\tan A = 2 \\), it logically follows that \\( \\cos A = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\).\n- This matches the expected result, aligning with both the trigonometric identities and the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\cos A = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion and Reflection:**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:** I started with attempting to express the sine and cosine in terms of triangle sides, which led me to realize that \\( \\tan A = 2 \\). Then, I used this relationship to directly calculate \\( \\cos A \\).\n- **Consistency Checks:** Throughout the process, I checked if the side lengths satisfied the Pythagorean theorem, ensuring that the triangle was valid.\n- **Verification with Identities:** Using the identity \\( \\sin^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1 \\) confirmed that the calculated values were correct.\n- **Mistakes and Corrections:** Initially, I thought of relating \\( \\sin A \\) and \\( \\cos A \\) directly to the sides, which led me to \\( a = 2b \\). This was correct but led to realizing that focusing on \\( \\tan A = 2 \\) provided a more straightforward path.\n- **Realizations:** Recognizing that \\( \\tan A = 2 \\) simplified the problem significantly, allowing me to compute \\( \\cos A \\) directly.\n  \nOverall, brainstorming different approaches, verifying each step, and reflecting on the correctness ensured a reliable solution to the problem.",
