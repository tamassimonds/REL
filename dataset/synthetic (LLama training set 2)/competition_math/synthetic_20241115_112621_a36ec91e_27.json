I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on whether each approach makes sense, and checking my work as I go along to ensure everything is correct.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe question is:  \nLet \\( f(x) = 2x - 3 \\) and \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\).  \nWhat is the value of \\( g(f(5) - 1) \\)?\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nOkay, so we have two functions, \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\). We're asked to find \\( g(f(5) - 1) \\). This looks like a composition of functions where we need to evaluate \\( f(5) \\) first, then subtract 1, and finally apply \\( g \\) to that result.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**  \n1. **Direct Evaluation:** Compute \\( f(5) \\), then proceed with \\( g \\).\n2. **Composition Approach:** Treat \\( g(f(5) - 1) \\) as a composition and see if simplifying helps.\n3. **Check if Simplification is Possible:** Maybe simplify \\( g(f(x) - 1) \\) before plugging in \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nI'm leaning towards **Direct Evaluation** because it seems straightforward, but I\u2019ll keep the other strategies in mind if I get stuck or if it looks like there's a simpler way.\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluating \\( f(5) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s start by finding \\( f(5) \\). Since \\( f(x) = 2x - 3 \\), I\u2019ll substitute \\( x = 5 \\) into the function.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\nf(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat seems correct. Multiplying 2 by 5 gives 10, and subtracting 3 leaves us with 7. No issues here.\n\n### **Step 2: Adjusting \\( f(5) \\) by Subtracting 1**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNext, we need to subtract 1 from the result of \\( f(5) \\). So, \\( f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\nf(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis checks out. Subtracting 1 from 7 gives 6. It\u2019s a straightforward operation, so I\u2019m confident it\u2019s correct.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying \\( g \\) to the Result**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, we need to find \\( g(6) \\) since we have \\( f(5) - 1 = 6 \\). The function \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\), so I\u2019ll substitute 6 into \\( g \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\ng(6) = 6 + 1 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAdding 1 to 6 gives 7. This seems correct. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any mistakes here.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAfter evaluating each step, the final result is \\( g(6) = 7 \\). I\u2019ll briefly check each step to ensure everything flows correctly.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- **Step 1:** \\( f(5) = 7 \\) \u2714\ufe0f  \n- **Step 2:** \\( 7 - 1 = 6 \\) \u2714\ufe0f  \n- **Step 3:** \\( g(6) = 7 \\) \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nEverything checks out. The answer makes sense logically, and the calculations are correct.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Simplifying the Expression First**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEven though the **Direct Evaluation** method worked smoothly, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a way to simplify the expression \\( g(f(x) - 1) \\) before plugging in \\( x = 5 \\). This could potentially save time or make the computation easier, especially for more complex expressions.\n\n**Exploring Simplification:**  \nLet\u2019s see if we can rewrite \\( g(f(x) - 1) \\) in a more simplified form.\n\n1. Start with the inner function:  \n   \\( f(x) - 1 = 2x - 3 - 1 = 2x - 4 \\)\n\n2. Now, apply \\( g \\) to this simplified expression:  \n   \\( g(2x - 4) = (2x - 4) + 1 = 2x - 3 \\)\n\n**Check with Original Function:**  \nWait a minute! This simplification results in \\( g(f(x) - 1) = 2x - 3 \\), which is exactly \\( f(x) \\).  \nSo, \\( g(f(x) - 1) = f(x) \\).\n\n**Realization:**  \nOh! This means that \\( g(f(x) - 1) \\) simplifies to \\( f(x) \\) for any \\( x \\). Therefore, \\( g(f(5) - 1) = f(5) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis is an interesting insight. It shows that the composition simplifies neatly, reducing the problem to evaluating \\( f(5) \\) directly.  \nLet\u2019s see if this alternative approach leads to the same result.\n\n### **Step 5: Applying the Simplified Result**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAccording to the simplification, \\( g(f(x) - 1) = f(x) \\). So, for \\( x = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\ng(f(5) - 1) = f(5)\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \nFrom **Step 1**, we already determined that \\( f(5) = 7 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis confirms our earlier result. Whether we go through the original steps or apply this simplification, the answer is the same: 7.  \n\nI\u2019m glad I explored this alternative strategy because it provided a deeper insight into the relationship between \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) and helped verify the correctness of the initial approach.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\ng(f(5) - 1) = 7\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy evaluating each step carefully and checking the work along the way, we determined that the value of \\( g(f(5) - 1) \\) is 7. Exploring an alternative strategy by simplifying the expression beforehand also reaffirmed the result, ensuring the solution is robust and accurate. This approach highlights the importance of reflecting and verifying each step in a mathematical problem to ensure correctness.",
