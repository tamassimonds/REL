    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem step by step, just like how a human would naturally think through it. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, here\u2019s the problem:\n\n*Two complementary angles, A and B, have measures in the ratio of 7 to 23, respectively. What is the ratio of the measure of the complement of angle A to the measure of the complement of angle B? Express your answer as a common fraction.*\n\nWhen I first read this, I remember that complementary angles add up to \\(90^\\circ\\). So, Angles A and B must sum to \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n1. **Understanding Ratios:** The measures of A and B are in the ratio \\(7:23\\). This reminds me of problems where we set up proportions.\n\n2. **Defining Complements:** Since they are complementary, the sum of their measures is \\(90^\\circ\\). Maybe I can express each angle in terms of a variable.\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:** I could set up an equation based on the given ratio and the fact that both angles sum to \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\n4. **Looking for Shortcuts:** Perhaps there\u2019s a way to simplify or use the properties of ratios without solving for each angle individually.\n\nThinking through these options, I feel that setting up equations based on the ratio and the sum of complementary angles might be the most straightforward approach. But I'm open to exploring if there's a quicker method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expressing Angles in Terms of a Variable**\n\nLet\u2019s define the measures of Angles A and B using a variable:\n\n- Let the measure of Angle A be \\(7x\\).\n- Let the measure of Angle B be \\(23x\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This makes sense because the ratio of A to B is \\(7:23\\), so using a variable \\(x\\) maintains that ratio.\n\n- **Reflection:** Does this align with the problem's requirements? Yes, because multiplying by \\(x\\) ensures both angles are proportional to their specified measures.\n\n**Check:** \n- The ratio \\( \\frac{A}{B} = \\frac{7x}{23x} = \\frac{7}{23} \\), which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation Based on Complementary Angles**\n\nNow, since A and B are complementary:\n\n\\[\nA + B = 90^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for A and B:\n\n\\[\n7x + 23x = 90^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Combining like terms: \\(30x = 90^\\circ\\).\n\n- **Reflection:** This seems logical because if their sum is \\(90^\\circ\\), and both angles are expressed in terms of \\(x\\), I should be able to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n30x = 90^\\circ \\\\\nx = \\frac{90^\\circ}{30} = 3^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Wait, \\(x = 3^\\circ\\)? That seems small, but it makes sense because we're dealing with degrees, and each part of the ratio is a multiple of the total \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Measures of Angles A and B**\n\nNow, let's find the measures of A and B using \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nA = 7x = 7 \\times 3^\\circ = 21^\\circ \\\\\nB = 23x = 23 \\times 3^\\circ = 69^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Reflection:** These angles add up to \\(90^\\circ\\) (21\u00b0 + 69\u00b0 = 90\u00b0), so the calculations seem correct.\n\n- **Check:** The ratio \\( \\frac{A}{B} = \\frac{21}{69} = \\frac{7}{23} \\), which matches the given ratio. This verifies that the approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Complements of Angles A and B**\n\nNow, let's determine the complements of A and B:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Complement of } A = 90^\\circ - A = 90^\\circ - 21^\\circ = 69^\\circ \\\\\n\\text{Complement of } B = 90^\\circ - B = 90^\\circ - 69^\\circ = 21^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since A and B are complementary, the complements will swap their measures.\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, this seems interesting. The complements are \\(69^\\circ\\) and \\(21^\\circ\\), which are actually the measures of B and A, respectively.\n\n- **Check:** This makes sense because the complement of an angle is what, when added to it, equals \\(90^\\circ\\). So, the complements should be the other angle.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determining the Ratio of the Complements**\n\nFinally, we need to find the ratio of the complements of A and B:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Complement of } A}{\\text{Complement of } B} = \\frac{69^\\circ}{21^\\circ} = \\frac{69}{21}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Simplifying the fraction: \\( \\frac{69}{21} = \\frac{23}{7} \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** This is the inverse of the original ratio \\(7:23\\). That\u2019s interesting and seems to align with the properties of complementary angles.\n\n- **Check:** \n  - Simplifying \\( \\frac{69}{21} \\): Divide both numerator and denominator by 3.\n\n    \\[\n    \\frac{69}{21} = \\frac{69 \\div 3}{21 \\div 3} = \\frac{23}{7}\n    \\]\n  \n  - **Final Check:** The ratio \\( \\frac{23}{7} \\) is indeed the inverse of the original ratio, which makes sense because the complements swap the ratio.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Approach Verification:** By setting up the problem with variables based on the given ratio and using the fact that angles A and B are complementary, I was able to solve for each angle and then find their complements.\n\n- **Reflection:** Initially, I considered looking for shortcuts, but setting up the equations provided a clear path to the solution. It\u2019s always good to double-check that the ratios align as expected, especially when dealing with complements.\n\n- **Check:** The final ratio of the complements \\( \\frac{23}{7} \\) is consistent with the properties of complementary angles and the given ratio of A and B.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The ratio of the measure of the complement of angle A to the measure of the complement of angle B is \\( \\frac{23}{7} \\).\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through each step, reflecting on the approach, and checking the work along the way, I ensured that the solution is accurate and aligns with the problem's requirements.",
