Compute \\( \\frac{p(3)}{p(4)} \\).**\n\nA few things immediately come to mind:\n\n- **Quadratic Polynomial:** So, we're dealing with something like \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are integers.\n  \n- **Root Involves Square Root:** The root \\( 4 - \\sqrt{11} \\) includes an irrational number. This reminds me of how conjugate roots work for polynomials with real coefficients. If \\( 4 - \\sqrt{11} \\) is a root, its conjugate \\( 4 + \\sqrt{11} \\) should also be a root.\n\n- **Calculating \\( p(3) \\) and \\( p(4) \\):** I need to evaluate the polynomial at two different points and find their ratio. That seems straightforward once I have the polynomial.\n\nInitial brainstorming leads to thinking about constructing the polynomial using its roots. But let's explore a bit to see if there are other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Construct the Polynomial Using Roots:**\n   - Since \\( 4 - \\sqrt{11} \\) is a root, and for polynomials with integer coefficients, its conjugate \\( 4 + \\sqrt{11} \\) should also be a root.\n   - We can form \\( p(x) \\) by multiplying \\( (x - (4 - \\sqrt{11}))(x - (4 + \\sqrt{11})) \\).\n\n2. **Use Vieta's Formulas:**\n   - Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the sums and products of its roots. Maybe there's a way to verify the polynomial coefficients this way.\n\n3. **Evaluate \\( p(3) \\) and \\( p(4) \\) Directly if Polynomial is Known:**\n   - Once the polynomial is constructed, the evaluation seems straightforward.\n\n4. **Check Property of Polynomials with Integer Coefficients:**\n   - If \\( p(x) \\) has integer coefficients and \\( r \\) is a root, then the conjugate of \\( r \\) must also be a root.\n\n**Reflection:** The first strategy\u2014constructing the polynomial using its roots\u2014seems the most direct. Let's start there and see how it unfolds.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Constructing the Polynomial**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since both \\( 4 - \\sqrt{11} \\) and \\( 4 + \\sqrt{11} \\) are roots, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) can be written as:\n  \\[\n  p(x) = (x - (4 - \\sqrt{11}))(x - (4 + \\sqrt{11}))\n  \\]\n  \n- This ensures that both roots are included, and multiplying these factors will give a quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's expand this step by step:\n\n\\[\np(x) = (x - 4 + \\sqrt{11})(x - 4 - \\sqrt{11})\n\\]\n\nFirst, apply the distributive property (FOIL):\n\n\\[\n= (x - 4)(x - 4) - (x - 4)(\\sqrt{11}) + (x - 4)(\\sqrt{11}) - (\\sqrt{11})(\\sqrt{11})\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n= (x - 4)^2 - (\\sqrt{11})^2\n\\]\n\nWait a second, that doesn't seem right\u2014I'm double subtracting \\((x - 4)(\\sqrt{11})\\) and \\((x - 4)(-\\sqrt{11})\\). Let me fix that:\n\nCorrecting:\n\n\\[\n= (x - 4)^2 - (\\sqrt{11})^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11\n\\]\n\\[\n= x^2 - 8x + 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, that seems off because I expected an integer coefficient polynomial, but my steps led me there. Let me double-check:\n\n- The conjugate pairs should have multiplied out to remove the square roots.\n- The steps indicate that the cross-terms canceled out.\n\n**Mistake Realization:**\n\nI see now that expanding directly might have led to an oversight. Perhaps a cleaner approach is to recognize that:\n\n\\[\n(x - (4 - \\sqrt{11}))(x - (4 + \\sqrt{11})) = (x - 4 + \\sqrt{11})(x - 4 - \\sqrt{11})\n\\]\n\nBut in simpler terms:\n\n\\[\n= ((x - 4) - \\sqrt{11})((x - 4) + \\sqrt{11}) = (x - 4)^2 - (\\sqrt{11})^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11\n\\]\n\\[\n= x^2 - 8x + 5\n\\]\n\nSo the polynomial is \\( p(x) = x^2 - 8x + 5 \\).\n\n**Check:** This polynomial has integer coefficients, and both \\( 4 - \\sqrt{11} \\) and \\( 4 + \\sqrt{11} \\) satisfy it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating \\( p(3) \\) and \\( p(4) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have the polynomial \\( p(x) = x^2 - 8x + 5 \\), I need to compute \\( p(3) \\) and \\( p(4) \\).\n- Then, I'll find the ratio \\( \\frac{p(3)}{p(4)} \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Compute \\( p(3) \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   p(3) = 3^2 - 8(3) + 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 9 - 24 + 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = -15 + 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = -10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compute \\( p(4) \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   p(4) = 4^2 - 8(4) + 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 16 - 32 + 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = -16 + 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = -11\n   \\]\n\n**Check:** \n\n- **Is \\( p(3) = -10 \\) and \\( p(4) = -11 \\) correct?**\n  - Let me quickly verify:\n    - For \\( p(3) \\): \\( 9 - 24 + 5 = -15 + 5 = -10 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n    - For \\( p(4) \\): \\( 16 - 32 + 5 = -16 + 5 = -11 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  \nBoth calculations check out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Computing the Ratio \\( \\frac{p(3)}{p(4)} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, with \\( p(3) = -10 \\) and \\( p(4) = -11 \\), I'll compute the ratio.\n- Since both numerator and denominator are negative, the ratio will be positive.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p(3)}{p(4)} = \\frac{-10}{-11} = \\frac{10}{11}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything seems to align. The polynomial construction was correct, the evaluations at \\( 3 \\) and \\( 4 \\) were accurate, and the ratio makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Does the answer make sense?**\n\n- **Polynomial Coefficients:** \\( p(x) = x^2 - 8x + 5 \\) has integer coefficients.\n- **Roots Verification:** \\( 4 - \\sqrt{11} \\) and \\( 4 + \\sqrt{11} \\) satisfy the polynomial.\n- **Evaluations:** \\( p(3) = -10 \\) and \\( p(4) = -11 \\) are correct.\n- **Ratio:** \\( \\frac{10}{11} \\) is a simplified positive fraction.\n\n**Mistake or Deep Thought?**\n\n- Initially, expanding the polynomial directly led to a slight oversight, but recognizing and correcting the error was straightforward. Reflecting often ensures that each step builds correctly on the previous one.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\n- Constructing the polynomial using conjugate roots is a powerful strategy here, ensuring that the coefficients remain integers. It also helps verify the correctness of the polynomial before proceeding with the evaluations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully constructing the polynomial, evaluating it at the required points, and computing the ratio, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{10}{11}}\n\\]\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by considering root properties and polynomial construction.\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Chose to construct the polynomial using roots, which led to successful polynomial formation.\n- **Step-by-Step Calculation:** Evaluated the polynomial at specific points to find \\( p(3) \\) and \\( p(4) \\).\n- **Reflection and Checking:** Regularly checked each step's correctness, ensuring accuracy.\n- **Final Answer:** Computed the ratio \\( \\frac{p(3)}{p(4)} = \\frac{10}{11} \\).\n\nThis approach mirrors human thinking\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adapting as needed to arrive at the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Because $p(x)$ has integer coefficients (in particular, because it has rational coefficients), the other root of $p(x)$ must be the radical conjugate of $4-\\sqrt{11},$ which is $4+\\sqrt{11}.$ Then, $p(x)$ must take the form \\[p(x) = A(x-(4-\\sqrt{11}))(x-(4+\\sqrt{11}))\\]for some nonzero constant $A$.
