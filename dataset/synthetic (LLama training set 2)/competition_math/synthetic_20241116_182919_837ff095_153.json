    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore each step thoroughly, and reflect often to ensure I'm on the right track. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, it reminds me of something I've encountered before\u2014determining the equation of a circle given specific points. Specifically, I recall that a circle's equation involves its center and radius. This makes me think that there might be a relationship between the given points and the circle's center and radius.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Using the Circle Equation:** \n   - I remember that the general equation of a circle is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n   - Since the center is on the x-axis, \\(k = 0\\). So, the equation simplifies to \\((x - h)^2 + y^2 = r^2\\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Systems of Equations:**\n   - With two points \\((0, 4)\\) and \\((1, 3)\\) lying on the circle, I could plug these into the simplified circle equation to create a system of equations to solve for \\(h\\) and \\(r\\).\n   \n3. **Alternative Approaches:**\n   - Maybe there's a geometric approach, like considering the distance from the center to the given points.\n   - Or perhaps using the fact that the midpoint between the two points relates to the center, but since the center is on the x-axis, this might not be directly helpful.\n\n**Reflecting on the Strategies:**\n- The first strategy\u2014using the circle equation with both points\u2014seems straightforward.\n- The second strategy, looking at geometric properties, might be more complicated given the specific requirement that the center is on the x-axis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I think the most direct method is to set up the circle equation with both points and solve for \\(h\\) and \\(r\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Set Up the Circle Equation**\n\nGiven that the center \\((h, 0)\\) is on the x-axis, the circle's equation is:\n\\[\n(x - h)^2 + y^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- This makes sense because it incorporates the center's x-coordinate and the y-coordinate being zero.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this equation represent all circles with centers on the x-axis? Yes, it should.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So far, so good. Now, let's plug in the points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Plugging in the Given Points**\n\n**Point 1: \\((0, 4)\\)**\n\\[\n(0 - h)^2 + 4^2 = r^2 \\\\\nh^2 + 16 = r^2 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Point 2: \\((1, 3)\\)**\n\\[\n(1 - h)^2 + 3^2 = r^2 \\\\\n(1 - h)^2 + 9 = r^2 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now I have two equations involving \\(h\\) and \\(r\\).\n- I can set them equal to each other since both equal \\(r^2\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Is it correct to set \\(r^2\\) from both equations equal? Yes, because both represent \\(r^2\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems like a valid approach. Let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Equate the Two Equations**\n\n\\[\nh^2 + 16 = (1 - h)^2 + 9\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- By setting the two equations equal, I can solve for \\(h\\).\n- This eliminates \\(r\\), making it easier to find \\(h\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I need to be careful while expanding \\((1 - h)^2\\). Let's do it step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Expand \\((1 - h)^2\\)**\n\n\\[\nh^2 + 16 = 1 - 2h + h^2 + 9 \\\\\nh^2 + 16 = h^2 - 2h + 10\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Wait, both sides have \\(h^2\\). Let me subtract \\(h^2\\) from both sides to simplify.\n\n\\[\n16 = -2h + 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- That simplifies things nicely. Now, solve for \\(h\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solve for \\(h\\)**\n\n\\[\n16 - 10 = -2h \\\\\n6 = -2h \\\\\nh = -3\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- So, the x-coordinate of the center is \\(-3\\).\n- This aligns with the initial conditions\u2014center on the x-axis.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does it make sense for \\(h\\) to be \\(-3\\)? Yes, the circle can be centered anywhere on the x-axis.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems correct. Now, let's find \\(r\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Substitute \\(h = -3\\) Back into Equation 1 to Find \\(r^2\\)**\n\n\\[\n(-3)^2 + 16 = r^2 \\\\\n9 + 16 = r^2 \\\\\n25 = r^2 \\\\\nr = 5\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The radius \\(r\\) is 5.\n- That should mean the circle passes 5 units away from the center \\((-3, 0)\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Is \\(r = 5\\) consistent with both given points? Let's verify briefly.\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n**For Point \\((0, 4)\\):**\n\\[\n(0 - (-3))^2 + 4^2 = 3^2 + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25 = r^2\n\\]\n**For Point \\((1, 3)\\):**\n\\[\n(1 - (-3))^2 + 3^2 = 4^2 + 9 = 16 + 9 = 25 = r^2\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- Both points satisfy the circle's equation with \\(r = 5\\). Everything checks out.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The radius of the circle is **5**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Did the Strategy Work?** Yes, setting up the circle equation and solving for \\(h\\) and \\(r\\) was effective.\n- **Is the Answer Reasonable?** A radius of 5 makes sense given the distances from the center to the points.\n- **Would Another Approach Have Been Better?** Perhaps, but this method was straightforward and led directly to the solution.\n\n**Overall Reflection:**\n- By brainstorming different strategies and consistently checking my work, I ensured that each step was correct. This approach not only provided the correct solution but also built confidence in the method used.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- The radius of the circle is **5**.",

Using the distance formula, we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(0-4)^2}&=\\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(0-3)^2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\sqrt{x^2+16}&=\\sqrt{(x-1)^2+9}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2+16&=(x-1)^2+9\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2+16&=x^2-2x+1+9\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 16&=-2x+10\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6&=-2x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=-3\n\\end{align*} Now we know the center of the circle is $(-3,0)$, and we need to find the radius.
