    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem: **Finding the range of the function \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\)**. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this, I think, **\"This looks like a rational function with a squared denominator.\"** Functions like this often have interesting ranges because the denominator can\u2019t be zero, and squaring something always gives positive values.\n\nBut then I wonder, **\"Wait, so \\( (1 - x)^2 \\) can never be zero, right? That means the function is defined everywhere except maybe at some specific point.\"** Hmm... Perhaps the range only includes certain positive values because squaring flips negatives to positives.\n\nAnother thought crosses my mind: **\"Is there a way to find the minimum or maximum value of such a function? Maybe completing the square or looking for symmetry could help.\"** But I'm not entirely sure that's the right path just yet.\n\nI also recall, **\"Oh, quadratic functions like this often have their vertex represent a minimum or maximum value.\"** Maybe I can leverage that.\n\nTo brainstorm, I think:\n\n- **Try graphing the function:** This might show me the general shape and help identify the range visually.\n- **Look for asymptotes:** Understanding where the function approaches but never reaches certain values could be crucial.\n- **Check if the function has a minimum value:** Since the denominator is squared, perhaps there's a minimum value the function can take.\n\nBut wait, graphing might take time, and I want to ensure my approach is solid from the start.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Graphing the Function:**\n   - **Pros:** Visual representation makes it easier to understand the range.\n   - **Cons:** Can be time-consuming and might not be precise without tools.\n\n2. **Algebraic Manipulation:**\n   - **Pros:** Allows exact calculations and insights into the function's behavior.\n   - **Cons:** Might get messy; need to ensure each step is correct.\n\n3. **Analyzing Asymptotes:**\n   - **Pros:** Identifying vertical or horizontal asymptotes can reveal key aspects of the range.\n   - **Cons:** Requires understanding how the function behaves as \\( x \\) approaches certain values.\n\nGiven these options, I think starting with **algebraic manipulation** might be the best path. This way, I can precisely determine key values before considering graphing or asymptotes.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the Denominator**\n\nLet's look closely at the denominator:\n\n\\[\n(1 - x)^2\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** I remember that squaring any real number results in a non-negative value. So, \\( (1 - x)^2 \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\).\n- **Check:** **Wait, but if \\( (1 - x)^2 = 0 \\), then the function is undefined.** That happens when \\( 1 - x = 0 \\) or \\( x = 1 \\).\n  \n  - **Realization:** So, \\( x = 1 \\) is a point of discontinuity. The function is not defined there. This is important because it might affect the range.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Minimum Value of the Denominator**\n\nBefore moving on, I need to understand the minimum value of \\( (1 - x)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n(1 - x)^2 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\n- **Thoughts:** The smallest value \\( (1 - x)^2 \\) can take is 0, but since the function \\( r(x) \\) has \\( (1 - x)^2 \\) in the denominator, **the minimum value the denominator can get is greater than 0** (since it's undefined when it's 0).\n\n- **Realization:** This means the denominator is always positive for all \\( x \\neq 1 \\). Therefore, \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} \\) is always positive whenever it's defined.\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Range of \\( r(x) \\)**\n\nNow, let's think about what values \\( r(x) \\) can take:\n\n\\[\nr(x) = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Since \\( (1 - x)^2 \\) is always positive (except at \\( x = 1 \\), where it's undefined), \\( r(x) \\) must be positive for all \\( x \\neq 1 \\).\n  \n- **Wait a minute:** **Can \\( r(x) \\) ever be zero?** No, because the numerator is always 1, and the denominator is always positive (except at points where it's undefined).\n\n- **Hmm:** **So \\( r(x) > 0 \\) for all \\( x \\neq 1 \\).**\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Lower and Upper Bounds**\n\nI need to determine if there's a minimum or maximum value for \\( r(x) \\):\n\n- **Thought Process:** Since \\( (1 - x)^2 \\) is always positive, \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} \\) will always be positive. But what about its minimum?\n\n- **Idea:** Maybe \\( r(x) \\) has a minimum value when \\( (1 - x)^2 \\) is maximum. But wait, as \\( |1 - x| \\) increases, \\( (1 - x)^2 \\) increases, hence \\( r(x) \\) decreases.\n\n- **Realization:** So \\( r(x) \\) is decreasing as \\( |1 - x| \\) increases. But what's the minimum value \\( r(x) \\) can approach?\n\n- **Aha Moment:** **As \\( |1 - x| \\) approaches infinity, \\( (1 - x)^2 \\) approaches infinity, and thus \\( r(x) \\) approaches 0.** But since \\( r(x) \\) is never zero (because the denominator can't be infinite), the minimum value of \\( r(x) \\) is greater than 0.\n\n### **Step 5: Using Limits to Confirm Minimum Value**\n\nTo be sure, let's consider the behavior of \\( r(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches infinity or negative infinity:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to \\pm \\infty} r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** **So, as \\( x \\) moves away from 1 in either direction, \\( r(x) \\) gets closer and closer to 0.** But it never actually reaches 0 because the denominator is always positive.\n\n- **Check:** **Does this make sense?** Yes, because the function is decreasing as \\( |1 - x| \\) increases.\n\n- **Realization:** **The range starts just above 0 and goes up to infinity.**\n\n### **Step 6: Expressing the Range in Interval Notation**\n\nBased on the observations:\n\n- **Minimum Value:** \\( r(x) \\) approaches 0 but never reaches it.\n- **Maximum Value:** There is no upper bound; \\( r(x) \\) can grow indefinitely as \\( |1 - x| \\) decreases towards zero.\n\nSo, the range of \\( r(x) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n(0, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Does the range make sense?** Yes, because the function is always positive, and as \\( x \\) moves away from 1, \\( r(x) \\) approaches 0.\n- **Is there any value missing?** No, all positive values greater than 0 are covered as \\( x \\) varies.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe range of the function \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} \\) is **\\( (0, \\infty) \\)**.\n\n---\n\nThroughout this process, I started by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking my work to ensure the approach was correct. Initially, I was unsure whether to graph the function or manipulate it algebraically, but focusing on analyzing the denominator and understanding the behavior of \\( r(x) \\) led me to the correct range. By considering limits and the function's decreasing nature, I confirmed that the range is all positive values greater than zero.",

Thus, as $x$ runs through the real numbers, $(1-x)^2$ runs through all nonnegative values, and its reciprocal (which is $r(x)$) runs through all positive values. The range of $r(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$."
