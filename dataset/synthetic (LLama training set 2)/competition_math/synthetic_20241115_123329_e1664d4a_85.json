    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking the natural thought process of brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and maybe even changing strategies along the way. I'll walk you through my initial thoughts, explore different approaches, check if I'm on the right track, and adjust as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, I'm trying to wrap my head around Juan's series of operations:\n\n1. **Adds 2 to a number**\n2. **Multiplies the result by 2**\n3. **Subtracts 2 from that result**\n4. **Divides by 2**\n\nAnd then, observes that the final answer is **7**. The task is to find the original number.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- This looks like a sequential operation on a number. \n- I remember working with sequences of operations before, maybe like simplifying expressions or solving equations step by step.\n- My gut feeling tells me I can set up an equation to represent all these steps.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Reverse Operations:** Start from the known final result (7) and work backward to find the original number.\n2. **Set Up an Algebraic Equation:** Define the original number as a variable and translate each step into an equation.\n3. **Use Numerical Examples:** Plug in some sample numbers to see if I can guess and check the original number.\n\nI think the **Reverse Operations** method might be the most straightforward, but to confirm, I'll also consider setting up an algebraic equation. If both align, I can be more confident in the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Reverse Operations Approach**\n\nLet's try working backward from the final answer (7) to see what the original number could be.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n- **Final Step:** Divide by 2 to get 7.\n  - So, before dividing, the number must have been \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\).\n  \n- **Second Step:** Subtract 2 from that result.\n  - Therefore, before subtracting 2, the number was \\(14 + 2 = 16\\).\n  \n- **Third Step:** Multiply by 2.\n  - Hence, before multiplying, the number was \\(16 \\div 2 = 8\\).\n  \n- **First Step:** Add 2 to that number.\n  - Finally, before adding 2, the original number was \\(8 - 2 = 6\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Let me quickly run through the operations with 6 to see if it matches the final answer of 7.\n  \n  1. **Add 2:** \\(6 + 2 = 8\\)\n  2. **Multiply by 2:** \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\)\n  3. **Subtract 2:** \\(16 - 2 = 14\\)\n  4. **Divide by 2:** \\(14 \\div 2 = 7\\)\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- The operations check out! Starting with 6 gives the correct final answer of 7.\n- This suggests that the original number is indeed **6**.\n\n**However, I want to be sure. Let's also try setting up an algebraic equation to see if it aligns.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Algebraic Equation Approach**\n\nNow, let's define the original number as a variable and set up an equation based on the problem's steps.\n\n**Defining the Steps:**\n- Let\u2019s denote the original number as \\( x \\).\n  \n  1. **Add 2:** \\( x + 2 \\)\n  2. **Multiply by 2:** \\( 2(x + 2) \\)\n  3. **Subtract 2:** \\( 2(x + 2) - 2 \\)\n  4. **Divide by 2:** \\( \\frac{2(x + 2) - 2}{2} = 7 \\)\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{2(x + 2) - 2}{2} = 7\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n- Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n  \\[\n  2(x + 2) - 2 = 14\n  \\]\n  \n- Add 2 to both sides:\n  \\[\n  2(x + 2) = 16\n  \\]\n  \n- Divide both sides by 2:\n  \\[\n  x + 2 = 8\n  \\]\n  \n- Subtract 2 from both sides:\n  \\[\n  x = 6\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- The solution from the algebraic approach also gives \\( x = 6 \\), which matches our reverse operations method.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both methods converge to the same answer: the original number is **6**.\n- This consistency reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's double-check by plugging the original number back through all the steps to ensure everything aligns perfectly.\n\n**Starting with 6:**\n\n1. **Add 2:** \\( 6 + 2 = 8 \\)\n2. **Multiply by 2:** \\( 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\)\n3. **Subtract 2:** \\( 16 - 2 = 14 \\)\n4. **Divide by 2:** \\( 14 \\div 2 = 7 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n- The sequence returns the expected final answer of **7**, confirming that the original number is indeed **6**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nThroughout the process, both the reverse operations approach and the algebraic equation method led us to the same original number: **6**. By verifying each step and checking the correctness along the way, I\u2019m confident in this solution.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- **Exploring Different Strategies:** Trying both working backward and setting up an equation helped confirm the solution.\n- **Checking Work:** Regular checks ensured that each step was correct and aligned with the final answer.\n- **Reflecting and Adapting:** Being open to changing methods when something didn't feel right led to a more robust solution.\n\nIn real-life problem-solving, it's essential to remain flexible, continually reflect on the approach, and verify each step to ensure accuracy, just like we did here.",
