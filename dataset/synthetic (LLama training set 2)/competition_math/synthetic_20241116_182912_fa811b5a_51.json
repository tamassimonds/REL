I'll walk through my thought process step by step, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each approach, checking my work frequently, and being open to adjusting my methods if something doesn't seem right. Here we go!\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, **\"The product of the positive integer divisors of a positive integer \\( n \\) is 729. Find \\( n \\),\"** I think:\n\n- **Familiar Concepts:** This reminds me of properties related to divisors, maybe something involving prime factorization or exponents. I recall that the product of divisors is linked to exponents in factorization.\n  \n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Perhaps I could use the properties of exponents or factorization to relate the product of divisors to \\( n \\). Maybe considering how divisors pair up could help. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start beyond that.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Prime Factorization:** Maybe breaking down 729 into its prime factors and seeing how that relates to divisors.\n   \n  2. **Properties of Divisors' Product:** Recall that for a number \\( n \\), the product of its divisors has a specific relationship with \\( n \\).\n\n  3. **Trial and Error with Small Numbers:** Perhaps testing small integers to see if their divisors multiply to 729 might give me a clue.\n\n  4. **Using Formulas for Products of Divisors:** There's a formula I remember that relates the product of divisors to exponents in the prime factorization.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Prime Factorization of 729**\n\n**Step 1:** **Factor 729 into Primes**\n\nLet me start by breaking down 729 to see its prime factors:\n\n- **Thinking:** 729 is a power of 3. I remember that \\( 3^6 = 729 \\). But let me double-check:\n\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 3 = 9 \\\\\n  9 \\times 3 = 27 \\\\\n  27 \\times 3 = 81 \\\\\n  81 \\times 3 = 243 \\\\\n  243 \\times 3 = 729\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Yep, that works. So, \\( 729 = 3^6 \\).\n\n**Step 2:** **Linking Prime Factorization to Divisors' Product**\n\nNow, I recall that for a number \\( n \\) expressed in its prime factorization as \\( n = p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{e_k} \\), the product of its divisors \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = n^{t(n)/2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( t(n) \\) is the number of divisors of \\( n \\).\n\n- **Thinking:** If I can relate the given product (729) to \\( n \\) using this formula, that might help.\n\n**Step 3:** **Applying the Formula**\n\nGiven \\( P = 729 = 3^6 \\), let's equate it to \\( n^{t(n)/2} \\):\n\n\\[\nn^{t(n)/2} = 3^6\n\\]\n\nBut first, I need to determine \\( t(n) \\).\n\n**Step 4:** **Determine \\( t(n) \\)**\n\nIn prime factorization, if \\( n = p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{e_k} \\), then:\n\n\\[\nt(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots \\times (e_k + 1)\n\\]\n\n- **Thinking:** I need both \\( n \\) and \\( t(n) \\), but I only have \\( P \\) so far. This seems like I need another equation relating \\( n \\) and \\( t(n) \\).\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Using Properties of Exponents**\n\n**Step 5:** **Rearranging the Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s rearrange the equation \\( n^{t(n)/2} = 3^6 \\) to find relationships between \\( n \\) and \\( t(n) \\):\n\n\\[\nn^{t(n)/2} = 3^6 \\implies n^{t(n)/2} = (3^2)^3 \\implies n^{t(n)/2} = 9^3\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This suggests that \\( n \\) raised to half the number of its divisors equals 729. Maybe \\( n \\) itself could be a power of 3, like \\( 3^k \\).\n\n**Step 6:** **Assuming \\( n = 3^k \\)**\n\nGiven that 729 is a power of 3, let's suppose \\( n = 3^k \\) and see if it fits:\n\n1. **Determine \\( t(n) \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   t(n) = k + 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute into the Product of Divisors Formula:**\n\n   \\[\n   P = n^{t(n)/2} = (3^k)^{(k + 1)/2} = 3^{k \\times (k + 1)/2}\n   \\]\n\n   But we know \\( P = 3^6 \\), so:\n\n   \\[\n   k \\times (k + 1)/2 = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( k \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   k \\times (k + 1) = 12\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   k^2 + k - 12 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   - **Thinking:** This is a quadratic equation. Let's solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\n     \\[\n     k = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 48}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 7}{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     k = 3 \\text{ or } -4\n     \\]\n\n   - **Reflection:** Since \\( k \\) must be a positive integer, \\( k = 3 \\).\n\n**Step 7:** **Finding \\( n \\)**\n\nIf \\( k = 3 \\), then:\n\n\\[\nn = 3^3 = 27\n\\]\n\n- **Check:** Let\u2019s verify if \\( n = 27 \\) satisfies the original condition.\n\n### **Checking the Solution**\n\n**Step 8:** **Calculate the Divisors of \\( n = 27 \\)**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n\n   \\[\n   27 = 3^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of Divisors:**\n\n   \\[\n   t(27) = 3 + 1 = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **List of Divisors:** \n\n   The divisors of 27 are: 1, 3, 9, 27.\n\n**Step 9:** **Calculate the Product of Divisors**\n\n\\[\n1 \\times 3 \\times 9 \\times 27 = 729\n\\]\n\n- **Observation:** The product of the divisors indeed equals 729, which matches the given condition.\n\n- **Reflection:** This confirms that our assumption \\( n = 3^3 = 27 \\) is correct.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Trying Small Numbers**\n\n**Step 10:** **Trial and Error with Small Integers**\n\nTo double-check, let\u2019s test small integers to see if any other solution exists:\n\n1. **\\( n = 1 \\):**\n\n   - Divisors: 1\n   - Product: 1\n   - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n2. **\\( n = 2 \\):**\n\n   - Divisors: 1, 2\n   - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n   - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n3. **\\( n = 3 \\):**\n\n   - Divisors: 1, 3\n   - Product: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n   - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n4. **\\( n = 4 \\):**\n\n   - Divisors: 1, 2, 4\n   - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n   - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n5. **\\( n = 5 \\):**\n\n   - Divisors: 1, 5\n   - Product: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n   - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n6. **\\( n = 6 \\):**\n\n   - Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6\n   - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 6 = 36\n   - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n7. **\\( n = 7 \\):**\n\n   - Divisors: 1, 7\n   - Product: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n   - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n8. **\\( n = 8 \\):**\n\n   - Divisors: 1, 2, 4, 8\n   - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 8 = 64\n   - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n9. **\\( n = 9 \\):**\n\n   - Divisors: 1, 3, 9\n   - Product: 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n   - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n10. **\\( n = 10 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 2, 5, 10\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10 = 100\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n11. **\\( n = 11 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 11\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 11 = 11\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n12. **\\( n = 12 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 12 = 144\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n13. **\\( n = 13 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 13\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n14. **\\( n = 14 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 2, 7, 14\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 14 = 196\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n15. **\\( n = 15 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 3, 5, 15\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 15 = 225\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n16. **\\( n = 16 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 16 = 128\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n17. **\\( n = 17 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 17\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n18. **\\( n = 18 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 18 = 972\n    - **Check:** Close but doesn\u2019t match.\n\n19. **\\( n = 19 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 19\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n20. **\\( n = 20 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 20 = 800\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n21. **\\( n = 21 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 21 = 441\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n22. **\\( n = 22 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 2, 11, 22\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 22 = 484\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n23. **\\( n = 23 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 23\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n    - **Check:** Doesn\u2019t match.\n\n24. **\\( n = 24 \\):**\n\n    - Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n    - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 24 = 13824\n    - **Check:** Much larger than 729.\n\n- **Reflection:** None of the small integers besides \\( n = 27 \\) produce a product of divisors equal to 729. This reinforces that \\( n = 27 \\) is likely the correct solution.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, including prime factorization and assuming \\( n \\) as a power of 3, and verifying through sample tests, it's clear that:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{27}\n\\]\n\nis the positive integer \\( n \\) whose divisors multiply to 729.

  "ground_truth": "Suppose that $n$ has $d$ divisors and that $d$ is even. Since the divisors come in pairs whose product is $n$, the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$. For example, if $n=12$ then the product of the divisors is $(1\\cdot 12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot 4)=12^3$. If $d$ is odd, then there are $(d-1)/2$ pairs which give a product of $n$, as well as the divisor $\\sqrt{n}$. So again the product of the divisors is $n^{(d-1)/2}n^{1/2}=n^{d/2}$. For example, if $n=16$, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $(1\\cdot 16)(2\\cdot 8)(4)=16^{5/2}$. To summarize, we have found that the product of the positive integers divisors of a positive integer $n$ is $n^{d/2}$, where $d$ is the number of divisors of $n$. Writing 729 as $3^6$, then, we have $n^{d/2}=3^6$, which implies $n^d=3^{12}$. So the possible values of $(n,d)$ are $(3,12)$, $(9,6)$, $(27,4)$, $(81,3)$ and $(729,2)$. We find that only in the third case $(n,d)=(27,4)$ is $d$ the number of divisors of $n$, so $n=\\boxed{27}$."
