I\u2019ll walk through my thought process step by step, exploring different strategies, checking my work, and reflecting often to make sure I\u2019m on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**What is the product of the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints at \\((2,3)\\) and \\((-6,5)\\)?**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** This reminds me of finding the midpoint between two points in a coordinate plane. I think there\u2019s a specific formula for that.\n- **Recalling Strategies:** Maybe I can use the midpoint formula I\u2019ve learned before: it's usually the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates.\n- **Uncertainty:** But then, the question asks for the product of these coordinates. So, after finding the midpoint, I need to multiply its coordinates together. That\u2019s a bit different from what I usually do.\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, so I need to confirm the midpoint first and then proceed to find the product of its coordinates. Let me start by recalling the midpoint formula and see if that leads me in the right direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Midpoint**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I remember the midpoint formula for two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is:\n  \n  \\[\n  M = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n- **Assigning Values:** \n  - Given points: \\((2, 3)\\) and \\((-6, 5)\\)\n  - So, \\(x_1 = 2\\), \\(y_1 = 3\\), \\(x_2 = -6\\), \\(y_2 = 5\\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nM_x = \\frac{2 + (-6)}{2} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nM_y = \\frac{3 + 5}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n\\]\n\n- **Result:** The midpoint \\(M\\) is \\((-2, 4)\\).\n\n**Checking:**\n- **Quick Check:** Adding 2 and -6 gives -4, which divided by 2 is -2. For the y-coordinates, 3 plus 5 is 8, divided by 2 is 4. That seems right.\n\n**Reflection:** This seems correct. I used the midpoint formula directly, and the calculations check out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Product of Midpoint Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, I need to find the product of the coordinates of the midpoint \\(M\\).\n- **Thinking:** Multiplying the x-coordinate and y-coordinate together.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Product} = M_x \\times M_y = (-2) \\times 4 = -8\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n- **Quick Check:** Multiplying -2 by 4 gives -8. This looks correct.\n\n**Reflection:** The product is indeed -8. I double-checked my multiplication, and it aligns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Entire Process**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Recall:** I started by finding the midpoint using the formula, then calculated the product of its coordinates.\n- **Reflecting:** Does each step logically lead to the next? Am I confident in my calculations?\n\n**Checking:**\n- **Midpoint Calculation:** Using the formula, both x and y coordinates were averaged correctly.\n- **Product Calculation:** Multiplication was straightforward, and the signs are correct (-2 times 4 is negative).\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. The steps logically follow each other, and the calculations are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Found the midpoint \\((-2, 4)\\) using the midpoint formula.\n- Calculated the product of its coordinates as \\(-8\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Was there an easier way?** Not really. The midpoint formula is standard for this type of problem, and it worked seamlessly.\n- **Did I consider different strategies?** Yes, initially thought of directly averaging the coordinates, which led me to the formula.\n- **Checking along the way:** Ensured each calculation was correct before moving to the next step, preventing errors.\n\n**Conclusion:** The product of the coordinates of the midpoint is \\(-8\\). Throughout the process, I made sure to check each step, ensuring the approach was correct and the calculations were accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:** The product of the coordinates of the midpoint is \\(-8\\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's revisit the problem and approach it more carefully, step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and ensure everything checks out along the way. Let's dive back in.\n\n---\n\n### **User Question Revisited**\n\n**What is the product of the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints at \\((2,3)\\) and \\((-6,5)\\)?**\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I initially tackled this problem, I used the midpoint formula, which seemed straightforward. However, comparing my earlier solution with the correct one, I realize I made a mistake in calculating the midpoint. Let me brainstorm and explore different strategies to ensure I get the correct answer this time.\n\n- **Recalling Strategies:** I remember the midpoint formula is essential here. But perhaps I misapplied it before. Maybe I need to double-check my calculations or consider an alternative way to verify the midpoint.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Besides the midpoint formula, I could visualize the points on a graph to better understand where the midpoint lies, but that might be unnecessary for simple coordinate calculations.\n\n- **Reflection:** It's crucial to ensure that each step logically follows and that calculations are precise. Let me carefully reapply the midpoint formula and verify the result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Reapplying the Midpoint Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need to find the midpoint \\(M\\) of the line segment connecting the points \\((2, 3)\\) and \\((-6, 5)\\).\n- The midpoint formula is:\n  \n  \\[\n  M = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n- **Assigning Values:** \n  - Given: \\( (x_1, y_1) = (2, 3) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) = (-6, 5) \\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nM_x = \\frac{2 + (-6)}{2} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nM_y = \\frac{3 + 5}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n\\]\n\n- **Result:** The midpoint \\(M\\) is \\((-2, 4)\\).\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Adding the x-coordinates: \\(2 - 6 = -4\\), and dividing by 2 gives \\(-2\\). For the y-coordinates, \\(3 + 5 = 8\\), divided by 2 is \\(4\\). This matches my earlier solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait a moment\u2014my original solution also arrived at \\((-2, 4)\\). Perhaps the error lies elsewhere, specifically in calculating the product of these coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Product of Midpoint Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I need to find the product of the coordinates of the midpoint:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Product} = M_x \\times M_y\n  \\]\n\n- Substituting the values:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Product} = (-2) \\times 4 = -8\n  \\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Multiplying \\(-2\\) by \\(4\\) clearly results in \\(-8\\). This aligns with my earlier calculation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Ahh Moment:** Despite my initial mistake, both the midpoint calculation and the product yield the same result as before. Perhaps my earlier claim of an error was unfounded. However, it's always good to double-check, and doing so reassured me that the process was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Entire Process**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Recap:** I accurately found the midpoint using the standard formula and calculated the product of its coordinates.\n- **Ensuring Accuracy:** It's essential to confirm that each step is correct and that the final answer logically follows from the process.\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- **Midpoint Calculation:** Averaging the x-coordinates and y-coordinates was done correctly.\n- **Product Calculation:** Multiplying the coordinates was straightforward, and the signs were handled appropriately.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Looking back, my initial concern about an error was unnecessary. The calculations were correct from the beginning, and the final product indeed is \\(-8\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Reapplied the midpoint formula, confirming the midpoint as \\((-2, 4)\\).\n- Calculated the product of the coordinates as \\(-8\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Mistake Acknowledgment:** Initially, I thought there was an error in my solution, but upon re-evaluating, I found that the midpoint and product were correctly computed.\n- **Learning Point:** It's always beneficial to verify each step, especially when uncertain. This practice helps catch potential mistakes but also reassures the correctness of the approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Final Answer:** The product of the coordinates of the midpoint is \\(-8\\).\n\nThroughout the process, I ensured to check and reflect on each step, leading to a consistent and accurate solution. Even when an initial doubt arose, revisiting and verifying the steps confirmed the correctness of the answer.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:** The product of the coordinates of the midpoint is **\\(-8\\)**.",
