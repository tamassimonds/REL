I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed. I want this process to mirror how a human would naturally think through a problem, complete with initial confusion, realizations, and occasional dead ends.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n> Three positive integers, each greater than 1, have a product of 27000, and are pairwise relatively prime. What is their sum?\n\nMy initial reactions are:\n\n- **Integer Factors:** We need to find three integers whose product is 27000. Since they are relatively prime, each integer must be a power of a distinct prime. This reminds me of problems involving prime factorization.\n  \n- **Prime Factorization:** Maybe start by factoring 27000 into its prime components to identify the possible integers.\n\n- **Sum Calculation:** Once the integers are identified, calculating their sum should be straightforward.\n\nBut then I think, \"Wait, I need to ensure that the primes are distinct since they must be pairwise relatively prime.\" This adds an extra layer to the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Approach:** \n   - Factor 27000 into its prime components.\n   - Group the primes into three distinct sets (each containing a single prime raised to a power).\n   - Calculate the product of each group to find the integers.\n\n2. **Exploring Combinations:**\n   - Consider different combinations of primes and their powers that multiply to 27000.\n   - Ensure that each combination is unique and pairwise relatively prime.\n\n3. **Checking Exponents:**\n   - Since exponents matter, ensure that assigning exponents correctly leads to the desired product.\n\nI think the **Prime Factorization Approach** is the most straightforward, so I'll start there.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Prime Factorization of 27000**\n\nLet's break down 27000 into its prime factors:\n\n- **Initial Division by 10:**\n  \n  \\[\n  27000 \\div 10 = 2700\n  \\]\n  \n  But 10 is \\(2 \\times 5\\), so:\n  \n  \\[\n  27000 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 2700\n  \\]\n  \n- **Continue Factoring 2700:**\n  \n  \\[\n  2700 \\div 10 = 270\n  \\]\n  \n  Again, \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), so:\n  \n  \\[\n  2700 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 270\n  \\]\n  \n- **Factor 270 Further:**\n  \n  \\[\n  270 \\div 9 = 30\n  \\]\n  \n  And \\(9 = 3^2\\), so:\n  \n  \\[\n  270 = 3^2 \\times 30\n  \\]\n  \n  But \\(30 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\), so:\n  \n  \\[\n  270 = 3^3 \\times 2 \\times 5\n  \\]\n  \n- **Combining All Factors:**\n  \n  From above:\n  \n  \\[\n  27000 = 2^3 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^3\n  \\]\n  \n  *(Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check by multiplying back, but for now, I'll proceed assuming it's accurate based on repeated divisions.)*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Pairwise Relatively Prime Integers**\n\nGiven that the integers must be pairwise relatively prime, each integer should be a power of a distinct prime. Therefore, we can assign each prime factor to one of the three integers.\n\nPossible assignments:\n\n1. **Integer 1:** \\(2^3\\)\n2. **Integer 2:** \\(3^3\\)\n3. **Integer 3:** \\(5^3\\)\n\nThis seems logical because:\n\n- Each integer is a power of a different prime.\n- They are pairwise relatively prime (no shared prime factors).\n\nI think this assignment makes sense, but let's **check** if there are other possible combinations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Other Combinations**\n\nCould there be other ways to assign the prime factors? Let's consider:\n\n- **Assigning Exponents Differently:**\n  \n  For example:\n  \n  - Integer 1: \\(2^1 \\times 3^2\\)\n  - Integer 2: \\(5^3\\)\n  - Integer 3: \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2\\)\n  \nBut wait, assigning multiple primes to a single integer would make them not pairwise relatively prime. Therefore, **this doesn't work**.\n\nAnother possibility:\n\n- **Distributing Exponents Across Different Primes:**\n  \n  For instance:\n  \n  - \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\)\n  - \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2\\)\n  - \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\)\n  \nBut when I try to multiply these, they exceed 27000 or don't multiply to it. So, **this isn't feasible**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The **only valid combination** is assigning each prime factor to a separate integer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Sum of the Integers**\n\nNow that we've identified the three integers as:\n\n1. \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n2. \\(3^3 = 27\\)\n3. \\(5^3 = 125\\)\n\nLet's calculate their sum:\n\n\\[\n8 + 27 + 125 = 160\n\\]\n\n*But let me **double-check**:*\n\n- \\(8 \\times 27 = 216\\)\n- \\(216 \\times 125 = 27,000\\)\n\n*This matches the original product, so it seems correct.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Reflection and Verification**\n\nThinking back, does everything align?\n\n- **Prime Factorization:** Confirmed as \\(2^3 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^3 = 27,000\\).\n  \n- **Pairwise Relatively Prime:** Each integer is a power of a distinct prime, so they are indeed pairwise relatively prime.\n\n- **Sum Calculation:** The sum adds up correctly, and the product of integers checks out.\n\nI feel confident that the solution is correct. The sum of the three integers is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{160}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThroughout the problem, brainstorming different strategies helped ensure that assigning primes correctly was crucial. Exploring other combinations initially seemed tempting but quickly revealed that only assigning each prime to a separate integer worked. Regular checks for consistency confirmed the correctness of each step, leading to a reliable solution.\n\nBy reflecting often and being open to adjusting the approach, I was able to navigate through potential pitfalls and arrive at the correct answer\u2014just like a human would when tackling a challenging problem.",

Therefore, the answer is \\[2^3+3^3+5^3=8+27+125=\\boxed{160}.\\]"
