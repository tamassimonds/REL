    "working_out": "Sure! Let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a natural thought process with brainstorming, reflections, checks, and adjustments along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **What's Being Asked?**  \n  The problem asks us to express \\( x^2 - 5x \\) in the form \\( a(x - h)^2 + k \\) and then determine the value of \\( k \\).\n\n- **Familiar Concepts:**  \n  This looks similar to completing the square, which is a method I\u2019ve used before to rewrite quadratic expressions. When I think of completing the square, I remember transforming a quadratic into its vertex form.\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**  \n  - **Strategy 1:** Use the completing the square method to rewrite the expression.\n  - **Strategy 2:** Compare coefficients after assuming the expression matches the vertex form.\n  - **Strategy 3:** Use a graphical approach to identify the vertex, but that might be overkill for just finding \\( k \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nCompleting the square seems the most straightforward since I\u2019m directly familiar with it for converting quadratics to vertex form. Let\u2019s start with that and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting Strategy 1 \u2013 Completing the Square**\n\n**Starting with Completing the Square:**\n\n- **Original Expression:**  \n  \\( x^2 - 5x \\)\n\n- **Objective:**  \n  Rewrite it as \\( a(x - h)^2 + k \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Recall the Method:**  \n  To complete the square, I need to:\n  1. Make the \\( x^2 \\) coefficient equal to 1 (it already is here).\n  2. Take half of the \\( x \\) coefficient, square it, and add/subtract inside the expression to form a perfect square trinomial.\n\n- **Calculating Half of the \\( x \\) Coefficient:**  \n  The \\( x \\) coefficient is \\(-5\\).  \n  Half of \\(-5\\) is \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\).\n\n- **Squaring It:**  \n  \\((- \\frac{5}{2})^2 = \\frac{25}{4}\\).\n\n**Writing the Expression:**\n\n- **Add and Subtract the Square Inside the Expression:**\n  \\[\n  x^2 - 5x = \\left(x^2 - 5x + \\frac{25}{4}\\right) - \\frac{25}{4}\n  \\]\n\n- **Factor the Perfect Square Trinomial:**\n  \\[\n  = \\left(x - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{25}{4}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Expanding Back to Verify:**\n  \\[\n  \\left(x - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 = x^2 - 5x + \\frac{25}{4}\n  \\]\n  Subtracting \\(\\frac{25}{4}\\) brings us back to the original:\n  \\[\n  x^2 - 5x + \\frac{25}{4} - \\frac{25}{4} = x^2 - 5x\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems correct. The expression is now in the desired vertex form \\( a(x - h)^2 + k \\). Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( h = \\frac{5}{2} \\), and \\( k = -\\frac{25}{4} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Confirming the Value of \\( k \\)**\n\n**Extracting \\( k \\):**\n\nFrom the rewritten expression:\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x = \\left(x - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{25}{4}\n\\]\nSo, \\( k = -\\frac{25}{4} \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?**  \n  \\( k \\) is the constant term outside the squared binomial. Negative \\( \\frac{25}{4} \\) aligns with the original expression being a simple quadratic without any additional constants.\n\n- **Alternative Verification:**  \n  If I plot the original quadratic \\( x^2 - 5x \\), the vertex form should have its vertex at \\( \\left(\\frac{5}{2}, -\\frac{25}{4}\\right) \\). This matches our transformation.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The value of \\( k \\) is indeed \\( -\\frac{25}{4} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thinking About Other Methods:**\n\n- **Strategy 2:** Comparing Coefficients  \n  Assume \\( x^2 - 5x = a(x - h)^2 + k \\) and expand \\( a(x - h)^2 + k \\). Then match coefficients to solve for \\( a \\), \\( h \\), and \\( k \\).\n\n- **Strategy 3:** Graphical Approach  \n  Plotting the quadratic to visually identify the vertex, but this might be unnecessary for just finding \\( k \\).\n\n**Possible Issues with Strategy 2:**\n\n- **Complexity:**  \n  Expanding \\( a(x - h)^2 + k \\) can get messy and might complicate things unnecessarily, especially since completing the square worked well.\n\n- **Time-Consuming:**  \n  Comparing coefficients could take more time than completing the square.\n\n**Deciding to Stick with Strategy 1:**\n\nGiven that completing the square provided a straightforward and correct solution, I\u2019ll stick with it. Exploring further strategies seems redundant now.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Check**\n\n**Ensuring Everything is Correct:**\n\n- **Rechecking the Steps:**  \n  - Completed the square accurately.\n  - Verified by expanding back.\n  - Confirmed \\( k \\) matches with both the transformed expression and the vertex form.\n\n- **Consistency:**  \n  All methods and checks align, reinforcing that our value for \\( k \\) is correct.\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nCompleting the square was an effective approach here. It led directly to the solution without unnecessary complications. The value of \\( k \\) is confidently \\( -\\frac{25}{4} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy completing the square, we transformed \\( x^2 - 5x \\) into \\( \\left(x - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{25}{4} \\), revealing that \\( k = -\\frac{25}{4} \\). Throughout the process, checking and reflecting ensured the accuracy of each step, confirming that this method was appropriate and effective for the problem at hand. Exploring alternative strategies highlighted the efficiency of completing the square, making it the preferred choice for this kind of transformation.\n\nThank you for guiding me through this problem!

  "ground_truth": "We complete the square.  We can square $x - \\frac{5}{2}$ to get $x^2 - 5x + \\frac{25}{4}$, so $x^2 - 5x = \\left( x - \\frac{5}{2} \\right)^2 - \\frac{25}{4}$.  We see that $k = \\boxed{-\\frac{25}{4}}$."
