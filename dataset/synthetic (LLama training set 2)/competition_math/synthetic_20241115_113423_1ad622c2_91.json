I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work often, and adjust my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n**Given:**\n- \\( z \\) and \\( w \\) are complex numbers\n- \\( |z| = 2 \\) and \\( |w| = 5 \\)\n- Need to find the **smallest possible value** of \\( |w - z| \\)\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This reminds me of distance in the complex plane. Since \\( |z| \\) and \\( |w| \\) are magnitudes, \\( z \\) and \\( w \\) lie on circles centered at the origin with radii 2 and 5, respectively.\n- The **difference** \\( |w - z| \\) looks like the distance between the points \\( w \\) and \\( z \\). \n- I recall that minimizing the distance between two points on different circles involves positioning them as close as possible. But how exactly do I calculate that?\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Geometric Approach:** Visualize the problem using the geometry of circles in the complex plane.\n2. **Algebraic Approach:** Use the properties of complex numbers and distances to set up an equation.\n3. **Use of Triangle Inequality:** Since \\( |w - z| \\) is a triangle side, maybe the triangle inequality can help.\n4. **Minimization Using Calculus:** Though it might be overkill, perhaps setting up a function and finding its minimum could work.\n\n**Wait a Moment...**\n- **Is the Triangle Inequality Applicable?** When I think about it, the triangle inequality deals with the sum of lengths, but here we're dealing with the difference. So, perhaps it's not directly applicable.\n- **Geometric Approach:** This seems promising. Visualizing the circles could help in understanding the minimum distance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Let\u2019s Start with the Geometric Approach** to see if it gives a clear path. If that doesn\u2019t work, we can explore other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- \\( |z| = 2 \\): This means \\( z \\) lies on a circle with radius 2.\n- \\( |w| = 5 \\): This means \\( w \\) lies on a circle with radius 5.\n- We need to find the smallest distance between any point on the circle of radius 5 and any point on the circle of radius 2.\n\n**Visualizing the Circles:**\n- Both circles are centered at the origin (0,0) in the complex plane.\n- The circle with radius 2 is inside the circle with radius 5.\n\n**Check: Does This Make Sense?**\n- **Yes**, since the circle with radius 2 is smaller, the circle with radius 5 encloses it. So, there\u2019s a possibility for points on both circles to be as close as the difference in their radii.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait**, if the smaller circle is entirely within the larger one, the smallest distance could be zero if a point on both circles coincides. But since the radii are different, zero distance isn't possible here.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **The smallest distance** should be at least the difference in the radii, i.e., \\( 5 - 2 = 3 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Minimum Distance**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **What if \\( z \\) and \\( w \\) are aligned?** If \\( z \\) and \\( w \\) are in the same direction from the origin, the distance \\( |w - z| \\) would be the difference in their distances from the origin.\n- **Formula Setup:** If \\( |z| = 2 \\) and \\( |w| = 5 \\), then in the same direction:\n  \\[\n  |w - z| = ||w| - |z|| = |5 - 2| = 3\n  \\]\n- **Is this the Minimum?** This aligns with my earlier reflection that the minimum should be 3.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does this approach work?** Let\u2019s verify:\n  - If \\( z \\) and \\( w \\) are on the same line passing through the origin, the distance between them is indeed the difference in their magnitudes.\n  - **Geometrically**, this makes sense: the closest two points on these circles occur when they are aligned.\n\n**Quick Reality Check:**\n- **Does a distance of 3 seem reasonable?** Yes, because the circle with radius 5 is larger and encompasses the circle with radius 2, so a minimum gap of 3 makes sense.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **The minimum possible value of \\( |w - z| \\) is indeed 3.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Thinking Aloud:** I initially considered multiple strategies, but the geometric approach seems to fit well here. Should I explore another method or is my current one sufficient?\n- **Verification:** To be sure, let\u2019s consider whether there are any other configurations that could reduce the distance \\( |w - z| \\).\n\n**Considering Other Configurations:**\n- **Opposite Directions:** What if \\( z \\) and \\( w \\) are in opposite directions? Would the distance increase?\n  - For example, if \\( z = 2e^{i\\theta} \\) and \\( w = 5e^{i(\\theta + \\pi)} \\):\n    \\[\n    |w - z| = |5e^{i(\\theta + \\pi)} - 2e^{i\\theta}| = |(-5) - 2| = |-5 - 2| = 7\n    \\]\n  - **Result:** The distance becomes 7, which is greater than 3.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait, that can't be right because...** My previous approach suggested a minimum of 3, and now I'm seeing 7 when \\( w \\) is in the opposite direction. This indicates that the minimum occurs when \\( z \\) and \\( w \\) are aligned, supporting my earlier conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Reinforcing the Result:** The minimum distance \\( |w - z| = 3 \\) is indeed correct, as aligning \\( z \\) and \\( w \\) gives the smallest separation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Summarizing Findings:** After exploring different strategies and verifying the calculations, it\u2019s clear that the smallest possible value of \\( |w - z| \\) is 3.\n- **Ensuring Clarity:** To present a complete answer, let's explicitly state the reasoning behind this conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Did I Explore All Possibilities?** Initially, I considered multiple approaches and found that the geometric method was the most straightforward. Checking against opposing directions confirmed the correctness.\n- **Would a Different Method Have Changed the Outcome?** While algebraic or calculus-based methods might arrive at the same result, the geometric approach provided an intuitive understanding, making it easier to grasp.\n- **Is the Answer Reasonable?** Yes, a distance of 3 aligns with the difference in radii, which is a logical outcome given the problem's constraints.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- By starting with a broad brainstorming session and then narrowing down to the most effective strategy, I was able to arrive at the correct solution. Regular checks along the way ensured that the approach remained valid, and considering alternative configurations helped confirm the minimum distance.\n\nThis step-by-step exploration reflects a natural human problem-solving process, complete with initial uncertainties, strategy adjustments, and continuous validation of the approach.",
