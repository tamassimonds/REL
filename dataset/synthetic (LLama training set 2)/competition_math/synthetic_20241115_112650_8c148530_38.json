    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a human's natural thought process. I'll brainstorm various strategies, reflect often, and check my work as I progress. If things don\u2019t seem right, I'll adjust my approach accordingly. Let's see where this takes us!\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem:\n\n**User's Query:**  \nExpress \\(3x^2 + x - 4\\) in the form \\(a(x - h)^2 + k\\), and determine \\(k\\).\n\n**First Reaction:**  \n- This reminds me of completing the square, which is a method used to rewrite quadratic expressions.\n- I've seen similar problems before, where quadratic functions are transformed into vertex form.\n- I think I need to identify the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(h\\), and \\(k\\) in the vertex form \\((x - h)^2 + k\\).\n\nBut wait, let me brainstorm different strategies to be sure.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Completing the Square:**  \n   - This is the most straightforward method I recall for converting a quadratic into vertex form.\n   - I\u2019ll attempt to match the given quadratic \\(3x^2 + x - 4\\) with \\(a(x - h)^2 + k\\).\n\n2. **Quadratic Formula:**  \n   - Maybe solving for roots could help, but this might not directly lead to vertex form.\n   - It feels like overcomplicating things since I\u2019m not explicitly asked for roots.\n\n3. **Factoring Methods:**  \n   - I recall that factoring could be another approach, but it usually applies to setting the quadratic equal to zero.\n   - Since the problem doesn\u2019t ask for factoring, I'll set this aside.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nCompleting the square seems the most applicable here. Let\u2019s proceed with that.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Completing the Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo express \\(3x^2 + x - 4\\) in the form \\(a(x - h)^2 + k\\), I'll start by completing the square for the quadratic part \\(3x^2 + x\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Factor Out the Leading Coefficient:**\n   - The leading coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is 3. I'll factor 3 out from the \\(x^2\\) and \\(x\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   3(x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x) - 4\n   \\]\n\n   **Reflection:**  \n   Does factoring out 3 make sense?  \n   **Check:** Yes, it simplifies the expression inside the parentheses, making completing the square easier.\n\n2. **Complete the Square Inside the Parentheses:**\n   - To complete the square for \\(x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x\\), I need to find a value that makes it a perfect square trinomial.\n   - Take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), and square it:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}\n     \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Does squaring half the coefficient make the trinomial a perfect square?  \n   **Check:** Yes, this is the standard method for completing the square.\n\n3. **Add and Subtract the Squared Value:**\n   - To keep the equation balanced, add and subtract \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\) inside the parentheses:\n     \\[\n     3\\left(x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{1}{36} - \\frac{1}{36}\\right) - 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3\\left((x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - \\frac{1}{36}\\right) - 4\n     \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Is this step correct?  \n   **Check:** Adding and subtracting the same value maintains equality. Seems correct.\n\n4. **Distribute the 3:**\n   - Distribute the 3 to both terms inside the brackets:\n     \\[\n     3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - 3 \\times \\frac{1}{36} - 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - \\frac{1}{12} - 4\n     \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Does distributing 3 correctly adjust both terms?  \n   **Check:** Multiplying \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\) by 3 gives \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\). Looks good.\n\n5. **Combine Like Terms:**\n   - Simplify the constant terms:\n     \\[\n     3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - \\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{48}{12}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - \\frac{49}{12}\n     \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Is \\(-4\\) converted correctly?  \n   **Check:** Yes, \\(-4\\) is \\(-\\frac{48}{12}\\), and \\(-\\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{48}{12} = -\\frac{49}{12}\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Match with Vertex Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to express \\(3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - \\frac{49}{12}\\) in the form \\(a(x - h)^2 + k\\) to identify \\(k\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Rewrite the Expression:**\n   - The expression is already in a squared form, but to match \\(a(x - h)^2 + k\\), I\u2019ll consider the signs carefully.\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Is the sign of \\(h\\) correct?  \n   **Check:** The term inside the squared expression is \\(x + \\frac{1}{6}\\), which is \\(x - (-\\frac{1}{6})\\). So, \\(h = -\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n2. **Identify \\(a\\) and \\(k\\):**\n   - From the expression \\(3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - \\frac{49}{12}\\):\n     \\[\n     a = 3, \\quad h = -\\frac{1}{6}, \\quad k = -\\frac{49}{12}\n     \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Does this match the vertex form structure?  \n   **Check:** Yes, it aligns with \\(a(x - h)^2 + k\\).\n\n3. **Determine \\(k\\):**\n   - According to the user query, \\(k\\) is the constant term outside the squared expression.\n     \\[\n     k = -\\frac{49}{12}\n     \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Does \\(-\\frac{49}{12}\\) seem like a reasonable value for \\(k\\)?  \n   **Check:** Yes, the calculations are consistent, and the value makes sense in this context.\n\n### **Step 3: Quick Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing the answer, let me quickly verify if the completed square form accurately represents the original quadratic.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Expand the Completed Square:**\n   \\[\n   3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - \\frac{49}{12}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   How will I expand this?  \n   **Check:** I need to distribute 3 and expand the square.\n\n2. **Expand \\((x + \\frac{1}{6})^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   (x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{1}{36}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Is the expansion correct?  \n   **Check:** Yes, squaring a binomial follows the \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) pattern.\n\n3. **Distribute 3:**\n   \\[\n   3(x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{1}{36}) = 3x^2 + x + \\frac{1}{12}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Does multiplying by 3 align with the original quadratic's coefficients?  \n   **Check:** Yes, \\(3x^2 + x\\) matches the original. The constant term needs to be adjusted.\n\n4. **Subtract \\(\\frac{49}{12}\\):**\n   \\[\n   3x^2 + x + \\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{49}{12} = 3x^2 + x - \\frac{48}{12} = 3x^2 + x - 4\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Does the expanded form equal the original quadratic?  \n   **Check:** Yes, both expressions are identical.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter completing the square and verifying by expanding back to the original quadratic, I\u2019m confident in the solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\nk = -\\frac{49}{12}\n\\]\n\n**Natural Check:**  \n- The value of \\(k\\) being negative makes sense because the original quadratic has a constant term of \\(-4\\), which corresponds to \\(-\\frac{48}{12}\\). After completing the square, the additional \\(-\\frac{1}{12}\\) accounts for the difference, leading to a total of \\(-\\frac{49}{12}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes the approach seem correct overall?  \n**Check:** Yes, each step logically follows from the previous one, and the verification confirms the accuracy.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, applying completing the square method, and verifying the steps along the way, I determined that the constant \\(k\\) in the vertex form of the quadratic \\(3x^2 + x - 4\\) is \\(-\\frac{49}{12}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We complete the square.  First, we factor 3 out of the terms $3x^2 + x$ to get $3 \\left( x^2 + \\frac{x}{3} \\right)$.  We can square $x + \\frac{1}{6}$ to get $x^2 + \\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{1}{36}$, so \\begin{align*}\n3 \\left( x^2 + \\frac{x}{3} \\right) &= 3 \\left[ \\left( x + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{36} \\right]\\\\\n&= 3 \\left( x + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 - \\frac{3}{36}\\\\\n& = 3 \\left( x + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{12},\\end{align*}and \\begin{align*}3 \\left( x^2 + \\frac{x}{3} \\right) - 4 &= 3 \\left( x + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{12} - 4\\\\\n& = 3 \\left( x + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 - \\frac{49}{12}.\\end{align*}We see that $k = \\boxed{-\\frac{49}{12}}$."
