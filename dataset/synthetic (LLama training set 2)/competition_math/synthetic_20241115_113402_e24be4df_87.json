Factorials grow pretty quickly, so perhaps there's a way to simplify the expression by canceling terms. \n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  - **Simplify the Numerator and Denominator Separately:** Maybe expand \\(6!\\), \\(4!\\), and \\(5!\\) to see if there's a pattern.\n  - **Factor Out Common Terms:** Possibly factor out terms in the numerator and denominator to cancel before expanding completely.\n  - **Alternative Approaches:** Perhaps using properties of factorials, like \\(n! = n \\times (n-1)!\\), might help in reducing the expression.\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards simplifying the numerator first by expanding \\(6!\\) and \\(4!\\) because that seems straightforward. Let's try that and see where it leads me.\n\n### **Step 1: Expand the Factorials**\n\nLet\u2019s start by expanding \\(6!\\) and \\(4!\\):\n\n- \\(6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\\)\n- \\(4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\\)\n\n**Thought Process:** Okay, adding these together seems simple enough.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  6! + 4! = 720 + 24 = 744\n  \\]\n\nNow, the expression becomes \\(\\frac{744}{5!}\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate \\(5!\\)**\n\nNext, let's calculate \\(5!\\) to find the denominator:\n\n- \\(5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\\)\n\n**Reflection:** So now, the fraction is \\(\\frac{744}{120}\\). \n\n- **Thought:** Hmm, that looks like a reducible fraction. Maybe I should simplify it before converting to a mixed number.\n\n### **Step 3: Simplify the Fraction**\n\nLet\u2019s simplify \\(\\frac{744}{120}\\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n- **Finding GCD:**\n  - 744 and 120 both are even, so divide by 2 initially:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{744 \\div 2}{120 \\div 2} = \\frac{372}{60}\n    \\]\n  - Divide again by 2:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{372 \\div 2}{60 \\div 2} = \\frac{186}{30}\n    \\]\n  - One more time by 2:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{186 \\div 2}{30 \\div 2} = \\frac{93}{15}\n    \\]\n  - Finally, divide by 3:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{93 \\div 3}{15 \\div 3} = \\frac{31}{5}\n    \\]\n\n**Checking:** Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.  \n- \\(93 \\div 3 = 31\\) and \\(15 \\div 3 = 5\\). That seems correct.\n\nNow, the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{31}{5}\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Convert to a Mixed Number**\n\nFinally, let's convert \\(\\frac{31}{5}\\) into a mixed number.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - Divide 31 by 5:\n    \\[\n    31 \\div 5 = 6 \\text{ with a remainder of } 1\n    \\]\n  - So, \\(\\frac{31}{5} = 6 \\frac{1}{5}\\)\n\n**Reflection:** That looks right. A mixed number makes sense here, and the conversion seems accurate.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet me quickly review the steps to ensure everything is correct:\n\n1. **Expanded Factorials:**  \n   - \\(6! = 720\\) and \\(4! = 24\\); their sum is \\(744\\).\n   \n2. **Calculated Denominator:**  \n   - \\(5! = 120\\).\n   \n3. **Simplified Fraction:**  \n   - \\(\\frac{744}{120} = \\frac{31}{5}\\) after dividing by the GCD.\n   \n4. **Converted to Mixed Number:**  \n   - \\(\\frac{31}{5} = 6 \\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\nAll steps align, and the mixed number makes sense. \n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and simplifying the expression step by step, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6 \\frac{1}{5}}\n\\]\n\nBy reflecting and checking each stage, I'm confident this approach is correct. It\u2019s always good to ensure that every step logically follows the previous one, especially when dealing with factorials and fractions.",
