    "working_out": "Sure, let\u2019s tackle this problem step by step, mimicking a human thought process complete with brainstorming, strategizing, reflecting, and checking. I\u2019ll write it out as naturally as possible, including initial thoughts, exploring different strategies, encountering issues, and adjusting approaches as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, I see the problem involves converting currency values between Namibian dollars (NAD) and Chinese yuan (CNY) through US dollars (USD) as intermediaries. This reminds me of currency conversion problems I've dealt with before, where you need to establish a relationship between different currencies.\n\nBut let me pause for a moment. **Is this just a direct conversion, or do I need to set up a proportion?** I also need to ensure that the exchange rates are understood correctly. **Wait, there's an exchange rate mentioned, but I'm not sure if it's straightforward. Maybe I need to think about how to use these rates to find the relationship between NAD and CNY.**\n\nAlright, I\u2019ll brainstorm a few strategies:\n\n1. **Use Exchange Rates Sequentially:** Convert Namibian dollars to US dollars and then US dollars to Chinese yuan.\n   \n2. **Set Up a Proportion Based on Exchange Rates:** Use the given exchange rates to establish a direct conversion between NAD and CNY.\n\n3. **Check If There's a Direct Conversion Rate Provided:** Look for a direct link between NAD and CNY without involving USD.\n\n**Hmm, the problem doesn\u2019t provide a direct conversion rate between Namibian and Chinese currencies.** So, I\u2019ll probably need to use the US dollar as an intermediary. **Let\u2019s proceed with the first strategy\u2014sequential conversion.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Conversion Rates**\n\nBefore jumping into calculations, I need to fully grasp the given exchange rates:\n\n- **1 US dollar (USD) = 7 Namibian dollars (NAD)**\n- **1 US dollar (USD) = 6 Chinese yuan (CNY)**\n\n**Reflection:** This means that 7 NAD can be exchanged for 1 USD, and similarly, 6 CNY can be exchanged for 1 USD. **So, to find the relationship between NAD and CNY, I need to link both to USD.**\n\n**Check:** Is there any mistake in understanding? **No, I think I\u2019ve got it right.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Converting Namibian Dollars to US Dollars**\n\n**Thought Process:** To start, I need to convert the cost of the painting from Namibian dollars to US dollars using the given exchange rate.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s say the cost of the painting in US dollars is \\( X \\).\n\nGiven:\n\\[ \nX \\text{ USD} = 105 \\text{ NAD} \n\\]\n\nUsing the exchange rate:\n\\[ \n1 \\text{ USD} = 7 \\text{ NAD} \n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[ \nX = \\frac{105 \\text{ NAD}}{7 \\text{ NAD/USD}} \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nX = 15 \\text{ USD} \n\\]\n\n**Check:** Wait, does this make sense? **Let me quickly verify.** If 1 USD = 7 NAD, then 105 NAD should equal \\( 105 \\div 7 = 15 \\) USD. **Yes, this checks out.**\n\n**Reflection:** So, the painting costs 15 USD. **I feel confident about this step.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Converting US Dollars to Chinese Yuan**\n\n**Thought Process:** Now, I need to convert the 15 USD into Chinese yuan using the second exchange rate.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ \n1 \\text{ USD} = 6 \\text{ CNY} \n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[ \n15 \\text{ USD} = 15 \\times 6 \\text{ CNY} \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n15 \\text{ USD} = 90 \\text{ CNY} \n\\]\n\n**Check:** **Let me think here.** If 1 USD equals 6 CNY, then 15 USD should be \\( 15 \\times 6 = 90 \\) CNY. **This seems correct.**\n\n**Reflection:** The final cost in Chinese yuan is 90 CNY. **This feels right.** I followed the sequential conversion method, and all the numbers check out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:** Before finalizing my answer, I should verify if there\u2019s a more straightforward way to do this or if my current method is the most efficient.\n\n**Brainstorming:** Could I have set up a direct proportion between NAD and CNY without involving USD? **Wait, the problem doesn\u2019t provide a direct exchange rate between NAD and CNY.** So, using USD as an intermediary seems necessary.\n\n**Reflection:** **Is there another method I missed?** Maybe using cross-multiplication or setting up a proportion directly between NAD and CNY. **But without a direct exchange rate, I think using USD was the right approach.**\n\n**Final Check:** **Does the answer make sense?** A painting costing 105 NAD is equivalent to 15 USD, which converts to 90 CNY at the given rates. **Everything checks out.**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and reflecting on each step:\n\n- **The painting costs 105 Namibian dollars (NAD).**\n- **Converted to US dollars (USD):** 105 NAD \u00f7 7 NAD/USD = 15 USD\n- **Converted to Chinese yuan (CNY):** 15 USD \u00d7 6 CNY/USD = 90 CNY\n\n**Final Answer:** **The painting would cost **90 Chinese yuan**.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:** By using sequential currency conversions through USD, I was able to determine the cost of the painting in Chinese yuan. Initially, I considered whether a direct conversion was possible, but since it wasn\u2019t provided, using USD as an intermediary was necessary. Throughout the process, I checked my calculations and reflections to ensure accuracy, adjusting my approach as needed to confirm the final answer.",
