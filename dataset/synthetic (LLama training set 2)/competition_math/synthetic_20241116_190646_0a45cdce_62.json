    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by thinking through it very much like a human would approach it. I'll start by brainstorming my initial thoughts, exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and reflecting on whether each step makes sense. If something doesn't seem right, I'll backtrack and try another method.\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Understanding the Task**: We need to find the length of a segment from point \\( A \\) to its reflection \\( A' \\) over the \\( y \\)-axis. The triangle's vertices are given, and we start with triangle \\( ABC \\) at points \\( A(1, -3) \\), \\( B(-2, 0) \\), and \\( C(4, 3) \\).\n\n- **Similar Problems**: This reminds me of problems involving reflections in coordinate geometry, where points change based on the axis of reflection. I think I've dealt with reflecting points over an axis before, so maybe applying that concept will help.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies**:\n  - **Reflecting Points Manually**: I could calculate the coordinates of \\( A' \\) by applying the reflection rule over the \\( y \\)-axis.\n  - **Using Distance Formula**: After finding \\( A' \\), I could use the distance formula to find the length \\( AA' \\).\n  - **Visualizing the Reflection**: Sketching a quick diagram might help me understand how reflecting over the \\( y \\)-axis affects the coordinates.\n\n- **Reflection**: Wait, before jumping in, let me double-check: Reflecting over the \\( y \\)-axis means that the \\( x \\)-coordinates of points change while the \\( y \\)-coordinates remain the same. Does that sound correct? Yes, it does.\n\nOkay, let's proceed by first finding the coordinates of \\( A' \\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Finding the Coordinates of \\( A' \\)**\n\n- **Strategy Chosen**: Since reflecting over the \\( y \\)-axis involves changing the \\( x \\)-coordinate, I'll apply that rule to point \\( A(1, -3) \\).\n\n- **Calculation**:\n  - The reflection rule over the \\( y \\)-axis is: \\( (x, y) \\) becomes \\( (-x, y) \\).\n  - Applying this to \\( A(1, -3) \\):\n    \\[\n    A' = (-1, -3)\n    \\]\n  \n- **Thought Check**: Does this make sense? Yes, changing the sign of the \\( x \\)-coordinate while keeping the \\( y \\)-coordinate the same fits the reflection over the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\nAlright, I've found \\( A'(-1, -3) \\). Now, let's move on to finding the length of the segment \\( AA' \\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Calculating the Length of Segment \\( AA' \\)**\n\n- **Strategy Chosen**: To find the length of \\( AA' \\), I'll use the distance formula between points \\( A(1, -3) \\) and \\( A'(-1, -3) \\).\n\n- **Distance Formula Reminder**: The distance between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is:\n  \\[\n  d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Applying the Formula**:\n  - Coordinates of \\( A \\): \\( (1, -3) \\)\n  - Coordinates of \\( A' \\): \\( (-1, -3) \\)\n\n  Plugging into the formula:\n  \\[\n  AA' = \\sqrt{((-1) - 1)^2 + ((-3) - (-3))^2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (0)^2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\sqrt{4 + 0}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\sqrt{4}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 2\n  \\]\n\n- **Thought Check**: Does this result seem reasonable? The \\( y \\)-coordinates are unchanged (-3 and -3), and only the \\( x \\)-coordinates differ by 2 units (from 1 to -1). So, a distance of 2 makes sense.\n\nPerfect! The length of segment \\( AA' \\) is **2 units**.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validity**: The steps followed align with the rules of geometry regarding reflections and the distance formula for calculating lengths between points.\n  \n- **Mistakes or Changes Needed?**: Initially, I brainstormed different methods like visualizing, but ultimately sticking to calculating the reflection and then applying the distance formula was straightforward and effective.\n\n- **Checking for Errors**: I double-checked each calculation step, ensuring that the reflection rule was applied correctly and that the distance formula was computed accurately.\n\n- **Ensuring Confidence in the Answer**: Everything checks out. The process felt logical, and the numbers align with the expected outcomes of reflecting over the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:** The length of the segment drawn from \\( A \\) to \\( A' \\) is **2 units**.\n\n---\n\nBy writing out each thought process, checking work continuously, and reflecting on the approach, we've ensured a thorough and human-like solution to the problem.",
