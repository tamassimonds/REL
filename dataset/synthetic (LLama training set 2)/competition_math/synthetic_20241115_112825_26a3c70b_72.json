I'll be jotting down my initial thoughts, exploring different approaches, and ensuring that each step leads me closer to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, my mind is racing with questions:\n\n- **What is being asked?** It states that the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + ax + b = 0\\) has solutions \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are nonzero real numbers. I need to find the pair \\((a, b)\\).\n\n- **Does this remind me of anything?** Hmm, quadratic equations often involve the relationships between coefficients and roots, like Vieta's formulas.\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Maybe I can apply Vieta\u2019s formulas, which relate the sum and product of roots to the coefficients. Or perhaps setting up equations based on the given conditions could work.\n\n- **Feeling Stuck:** Wait, I'm not entirely sure how Vieta's directly applies here since the roots are not just numbers but the coefficients themselves. This seems a bit odd.\n\nAlright, let's explore different strategies to see which one fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Vieta's Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nVieta\u2019s formulas tell us that for a quadratic equation \\(x^2 + px + q = 0\\):\n\n- The sum of the roots is \\( -p \\)\n- The product of the roots is \\( q \\)\n\n**Applying to Our Equation:**\n\nGiven \\(x^2 + ax + b = 0\\) with roots \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\n- Sum of roots: \\(a + b = -a\\)\n- Product of roots: \\(ab = b\\)\n\n**Setting Up Equations:**\n\n1. \\(a + b = -a\\)\n2. \\(ab = b\\)\n\n**Check:** \n\n- **Equation 1:** \\(a + b = -a\\) simplifies to \\(b = -2a\\).\n- **Equation 2:** \\(ab = b\\). Since \\(b \\neq 0\\), divide both sides by \\(b\\): \\(a = 1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, if \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = -2a = -2 \\times 1 = -2\\), then \\((a, b) = (1, -2)\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Sum Check:** \\(1 + (-2) = -1\\), which equals \\(-a\\) since \\(a = 1\\).\n- **Product Check:** \\(1 \\times (-2) = -2\\), which equals \\(b\\).\n\nBoth conditions satisfy Vieta\u2019s formulas. This seems like it could be correct, but let\u2019s double-check with another method to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Alternative Approach Using Quadratic Identity**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAnother way to verify is to substitute the roots back into the original equation and see if they satisfy it.\n\n**Attempting to Solve:**\n\nGiven \\(x = a\\) and \\(x = b\\) are roots:\n\n1. For \\(x = a\\):  \n   \\[a^2 + aa + b = 0 \\Rightarrow a^2 + a^2 + b = 0 \\Rightarrow 2a^2 + b = 0\\]\n   \n2. For \\(x = b\\):  \n   \\[b^2 + ab + b = 0\\]\n\n**Substituting \\(b = -2a\\) into \\(2a^2 + b = 0\\):**\n\n\\[2a^2 + (-2a) = 0 \\Rightarrow 2a(a - 1) = 0\\]\n\nSince \\(a \\neq 0\\), this implies \\(a = 1\\).\n\n**Calculating \\(b\\):**\n\n\\[b = -2a = -2 \\times 1 = -2\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis alternative approach also leads us to \\((a, b) = (1, -2)\\). It confirms the result obtained using Vieta\u2019s formulas.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBoth methods point to the same solution. But let's ensure it's correct by checking if both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) indeed satisfy the original quadratic equation as roots.\n\n**Original Equation:**\n\n\\[x^2 + ax + b = 0\\]\n\n**Substituting \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = -2\\):**\n\n\\[x^2 + 1x - 2 = 0\\]\n\n**Finding Roots:**\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:  \n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-2)}}{2 \\times 1}\\]  \n\\[x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 3}{2}\\]  \n\\[x = 1 \\text{ or } -2\\]\n\n**Checking the Roots:**\n\nWe found the roots to be \\(1\\) and \\(-2\\), which match \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). This aligns perfectly with the conditions given in the problem.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. Both strategies lead to the same solution, and verifying by substituting into the original equation confirms its correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough exploring different methods\u2014Vieta\u2019s formulas and a quadratic identity approach\u2014and verifying the solution by substituting back into the original equation, we've determined that the pair \\((a, b)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(1, -2)}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step process, reflecting and checking along the way, ensured that the solution is both accurate and robust.",
