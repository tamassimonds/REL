    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's begin by really understanding the question and exploring the possible paths to the solution.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe problem gives me two functions:\n\n\\[\np(x) = 2x - 7\n\\]\n\n\\[\nq(x) = 3x - b\n\\]\n\nAnd it tells me that \\( p(q(4)) = 7 \\). I need to find the value of \\( b \\).\n\n**Initial Reflection:**\n\n- **Nested Functions:** This reminds me of problems involving composition of functions, where one function is applied inside another.\n  \n- **Solving for \\( b \\):** Since \\( b \\) is inside \\( q(x) \\), I\u2019ll need to express everything in terms of \\( b \\) to solve for it.\n\n- **Given Value:** The fact that \\( p(q(4)) = 7 \\) provides a specific condition that links \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\).\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Substitution:** Calculate \\( q(4) \\) first and then substitute that into \\( p(x) \\).\n\n2. **Set Up an Equation:** Since \\( p(q(4)) = 7 \\), set up an equation involving \\( b \\) and solve for \\( b \\).\n\n3. **Check Consistency:** After finding \\( b \\), substitute back to verify the solution.\n\n**Wait a Second:**\n\nBefore diving in, I remember that nested functions can sometimes lead to complex equations. Maybe there's a simpler way, but let's proceed with the direct substitution method and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Calculate \\( q(4) \\)**\n\nLet's start by finding \\( q(4) \\):\n\n\\[\nq(x) = 3x - b\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nq(4) = 3(4) - b = 12 - b\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Reflection:** Okay, now I have \\( q(4) = 12 - b \\). This seems straightforward. I'll use this in the next step.\n\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, I'm just substituting \\( x = 4 \\) into \\( q(x) \\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\( q(4) \\) into \\( p(x) \\)**\n\nNow, substitute \\( q(4) = 12 - b \\) into \\( p(x) \\):\n\n\\[\np(q(4)) = p(12 - b)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Reflection:** I need to express \\( p(12 - b) \\) in terms of \\( b \\). Let me plug \\( 12 - b \\) into the expression for \\( p(x) \\).\n\n- **Check:** Is this the right approach? Yes, substituting into \\( p(x) \\) is how composition works.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Compute \\( p(12 - b) \\)**\n\nNow, compute \\( p(12 - b) \\):\n\n\\[\np(x) = 2x - 7\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\np(12 - b) = 2(12 - b) - 7\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 24 - 2b - 7\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 17 - 2b\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, that can't be right because...** No, this seems correct. I multiplied \\( 12 - b \\) by 2 and then subtracted 7.\n\n- **Check:** Quick check: \\( 2(12) = 24 \\), and \\( -2b - 7 \\) gives \\( -2b - 7 \\). So, \\( 24 - 7 = 17 \\), and subtracting \\( 2b \\) makes sense.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Set Up the Equation \\( p(q(4)) = 7 \\)**\n\nThe problem states that \\( p(q(4)) = 7 \\), so set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n17 - 2b = 7\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Reflection:** This equation looks straightforward. I'll solve for \\( b \\) now.\n\n- **Check:** Does it make sense? Yes, we're given that \\( p(q(4)) = 7 \\), so setting this equal to our expression for \\( p(q(4)) \\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Solve for \\( b \\)**\n\nNow, solve the equation \\( 17 - 2b = 7 \\):\n\n\\[\n17 - 2b = 7\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Wait, that can't be right because...** No, this seems correct. I need to isolate \\( b \\).\n\n- **Reflect:** To isolate \\( b \\), subtract 17 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-2b = 7 - 17\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-2b = -10\n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Divide by \\(-2\\) to Solve for \\( b \\)**\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-10}{-2} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does dividing \\(-10\\) by \\(-2\\) make sense? Yes, it simplifies correctly to \\( 5 \\).\n\n- **Deeper Reflection:** Let me think if \\( b = 5 \\) makes sense in the original equations. If I plug \\( b = 5 \\) back, does everything work out?\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Verify the Solution by Substituting \\( b = 5 \\) Back**\n\nLet's substitute \\( b = 5 \\) back into the original functions to verify:\n\n1. **Compute \\( q(4) \\) with \\( b = 5 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   q(4) = 12 - b = 12 - 5 = 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compute \\( p(q(4)) \\) with \\( q(4) = 7 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   p(7) = 2(7) - 7 = 14 - 7 = 7\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Aha Moment:** Wait, this works perfectly! Substituting \\( b = 5 \\) satisfies the original condition \\( p(q(4)) = 7 \\).\n\n- **Check:** So, \\( b = 5 \\) is indeed the correct value.\n\n- **Random Insight:** It's always good to verify by plugging back into the original equations. This ensures that no mistakes were made along the way.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Brainstorming Recap:** I initially thought about directly finding \\( q(4) \\) and then substituting it into \\( p(x) \\). This straightforward approach worked well.\n\n- **Reflection:** Throughout the steps, I checked each part to ensure everything aligned with the given condition. When I reached \\( b = 5 \\), verifying by back substitution confirmed the correctness.\n\n- **Mistake Checking:** There were no major mistakes, but I made sure to reflect and verify at each step to catch any potential errors early.\n\n- **Natural Flow:** The thinking process felt natural, moving from calculating \\( q(4) \\) to substituting into \\( p(x) \\), setting up the equation, solving for \\( b \\), and finally verifying the solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nb = 5\n\\]\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and verifying\u2014I was able to arrive confidently at the solution. This human-like thinking ensures that each step builds correctly on the previous one, leading to an accurate final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $q(4) = 3\\cdot 4 - b = 12-b$, we can write $p(q(4)) = 7$ as $p(12-b) = 7$.  Since $p(x) = 2x-7$, we have $p(12-b) = 2(12-b) - 7 = 17 - 2b$. Substituting this into $p(12-b) = 7$ gives $17-2b =7$, from which we have $b = \\boxed{5}$."
