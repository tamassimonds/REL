    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: **Find the last three digits of \\(9^{105}\\).**\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I think, *Okay, I need to find the last three digits of \\(9^{105}\\). That means I\u2019m looking for \\(9^{105} \\mod 1000\\).*\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**\n  - **Direct Computation:** My first instinct is to compute \\(9^{105}\\) directly and then take it modulo 1000. But, honestly, that number is going to be huge! I remember from past problems that exponentiation can grow really quickly, and calculating it directly isn't practical.\n  \n  - **Modular Arithmetic:** Another approach that comes to mind is using properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the calculation. Maybe breaking it down using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) since 1000 factors into 8 and 125, which are relatively prime.\n  \n  - **Pattern Recognition:** I recall that sometimes looking for patterns in lower exponents can help identify a cycle or a repeating pattern, which might make the higher exponent more manageable.\n\n  - **Using Euler's Theorem:** Since 9 and 1000 are coprime, Euler's Theorem might be applicable here to reduce the exponent.\n\nBut honestly, I\u2019m not sure which method is the best without exploring. Let\u2019s explore each strategy to see which one works best.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n#### **1. Direct Computation:**\n\n- **Thought Process:** \n  - Attempt to compute \\(9^{105}\\) directly.\n  - *Reflection:* This seems impractical because \\(9^{105}\\) is an enormous number. Calculating it directly would require significant computational resources and time.\n\n- **Quick Check:** \n  - *Stuck Thinking:* \"Wait, that can't be right because computing \\(9^{105}\\) directly is unfeasible. I need a better approach.\"\n\n#### **2. Modular Arithmetic and CRT:**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - Break down the problem by finding \\(9^{105} \\mod 8\\) and \\(9^{105} \\mod 125\\), then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n  - *Reflection:* This seems like a more manageable approach since both 8 and 125 are smaller moduli compared to 1000.\n\n- **Check:** \n  - \"Let me try this and see if it leads to a solution.\"\n\n#### **3. Pattern Recognition:**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - Look for patterns in lower powers of 9 to see if there's a repeating cycle that can be leveraged.\n  - *Reflection:* This could work if a pattern is identifiable, but I'm unsure if such a pattern exists for \\(9^{105}\\) mod 1000.\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - \"Hmm, I should probably try this after testing the modular arithmetic approach. If that doesn't work, I can come back to it.\"\n\n#### **4. Euler's Theorem:**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - Since 9 and 1000 are coprime (\\(\\gcd(9, 1000) = 1\\)), Euler's Theorem states that \\(9^{\\phi(1000)} \\equiv 1 \\mod 1000\\).\n  - Calculate \\(\\phi(1000)\\) and see if it reduces the exponent 105.\n  \n- **Check:**\n  - \"This might be a solid approach. Let\u2019s compute \\(\\phi(1000)\\) and see where it leads.\"\n\n### **Narrowing Down the Strategy:**\n\nAfter considering these strategies, I think **modular arithmetic using CRT** combined with **Euler\u2019s Theorem** might be the most efficient. Let\u2019s proceed with that.\n\n### **Step 1: Compute \\(9^{105} \\mod 8\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - Simplify \\(9\\) modulo \\(8\\).\n  - *Calculation:* \\(9 \\equiv 1 \\mod 8\\)\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - \"That's interesting! \\(9\\) modulo \\(8\\) is \\(1\\), which simplifies things greatly.\"\n\n- **Compute:**\n  - \\(9^{105} \\equiv 1^{105} \\equiv 1 \\mod 8\\)\n\n- **Check:**\n  - \"This result makes sense because any power of \\(1\\) is \\(1\\).\"\n\n### **Step 2: Compute \\(9^{105} \\mod 125\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - This is more complex. Since \\(125 = 5^3\\), I need to use Euler\u2019s Theorem because \\(9\\) and \\(125\\) are coprime.\n  \n- **Calculating \\(\\phi(125)\\):**\n  - Recall that for \\(p^k\\), \\(\\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}\\).\n  - *Calculation:* \\(\\phi(125) = 125 - 25 = 100\\)\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - \"Okay, so \\(\\phi(125) = 100\\). According to Euler\u2019s Theorem, \\(9^{100} \\equiv 1 \\mod 125\\).\"\n  \n- **Reducing the Exponent:**\n  - Since \\(9^{100} \\equiv 1 \\mod 125\\), to evaluate \\(9^{105} \\mod 125\\), we can write:\n    \\[\n    9^{105} = 9^{100} \\times 9^5 \\equiv 1 \\times 9^5 \\mod 125\n    \\]\n  \n- **Calculating \\(9^5 \\mod 125\\):**\n  - Break it down to make it easier:\n    \\[\n    9^2 = 81\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    9^4 = (9^2)^2 = 81^2 = 6561\n    \\]\n    - *Reflection:* \"Let\u2019s reduce \\(6561\\) modulo \\(125\\):\"\n      \\[\n      6561 \\div 125 = 52 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 61\n      \\]\n      So, \\(9^4 \\equiv 61 \\mod 125\\).\n    \n    \\[\n    9^5 = 9^4 \\times 9 \\equiv 61 \\times 9 = 549\n    \\]\n    - *Reducing \\(549\\) modulo \\(125\\):*\n      \\[\n      549 \\div 125 = 4 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 49\n      \\]\n      Thus, \\(9^5 \\equiv 49 \\mod 125\\).\n\n- **Check:**\n  - \"So, \\(9^{105} \\equiv 49 \\mod 125\\). That seems correct.\"\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - We have two congruences:\n    \\[\n    9^{105} \\equiv 1 \\mod 8\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    9^{105} \\equiv 49 \\mod 125\n    \\]\n  - Use CRT to find a common solution modulo \\(1000\\) (since \\(1000 = 8 \\times 125\\)).\n\n- **Solving the Congruences:**\n  - Find \\(x\\) such that:\n    \\[\n    x \\equiv 1 \\mod 8\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x \\equiv 49 \\mod 125\n    \\]\n  \n- **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n  \n  1. **Rewrite the Congruence:**\n     \\[\n     x = 125k + 49 \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n     \\]\n  \n  2. **Substitute into the First Congruence:**\n     \\[\n     125k + 49 \\equiv 1 \\mod 8\n     \\]\n  \n  3. **Simplify:**\n     - *Reflection:* \"First, reduce \\(125\\) and \\(49\\) modulo \\(8\\):\"\n       \\[\n       125 \\div 8 = 15 \\quad \\text{remainder } 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 125 \\equiv 5 \\mod 8\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       49 \\div 8 = 6 \\quad \\text{remainder } 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 49 \\equiv 1 \\mod 8\n       \\]\n     - So the equation becomes:\n       \\[\n       5k + 1 \\equiv 1 \\mod 8\n       \\]\n     - Simplifying:\n       \\[\n       5k \\equiv 0 \\mod 8\n       \\]\n  \n  4. **Solve for \\(k\\):**\n     - Need to find \\(k\\) such that \\(5k \\equiv 0 \\mod 8\\).\n     - *Reflection:* \"Since \\(5\\) and \\(8\\) are coprime, \\(k\\) must be a multiple of \\(8\\).\"\n       \\[\n       k = 8m \\quad \\text{for some integer } m\n       \\]\n  \n  5. **Substitute Back to Find \\(x\\):**\n     \\[\n     x = 125(8m) + 49 = 1000m + 49\n     \\]\n     - *Reflection:* \"This means \\(x\\) is always \\(49\\) modulo \\(1000\\) regardless of \\(m\\).\"\n  \n  6. **Final Solution:**\n     \\[\n     x \\equiv 49 \\mod 1000\n     \\]\n  \n- **Check:**\n  - \"Let me verify that this satisfies both original congruences.\"\n    - \\(49 \\mod 8 = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n    - \\(49 \\mod 125 = 49\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - \"Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution makes sense.\"\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe last three digits of \\(9^{105}\\) are **049**.\n\n### **Reflection and Verification:**\n\n- **Approach Validation:**\n  - Initially, I considered multiple strategies and decided that using modular arithmetic with the CRT was the most efficient.\n  - By breaking down \\(9^{105}\\) into smaller, manageable parts (\\(9^{105} \\mod 8\\) and \\(9^{105} \\mod 125\\)), I avoided the impracticality of direct computation.\n\n- **Intermediate Checks:**\n  - After each step, I verified that the calculations were correct (e.g., confirming \\(9^{5} \\mod 125\\)).\n  - Ensured that the congruences were correctly set up and solved.\n\n- **Final Verification:**\n  - Substituting \\(x = 49\\) back into the original congruences confirmed that it satisfies both conditions.\n  - Double-checking the calculations aligned with CRT principles, ensuring the solution was consistent and correct.\n\n- **Random Insight:**\n  - \"Actually, there might be an easier way, but this method aligns well with standard approaches for such problems.\"\n\n- **Mistake Acknowledgment:**\n  - Initially thought about using pattern recognition, but upon reflection, it seemed more straightforward to leverage modular arithmetic and CRT.\n\n- **Final Thoughts:**\n  - The step-by-step approach, coupled with regular checks and reflections, ensured the solution was accurate.\n  - Handling each modulus separately and then combining them using CRT was an effective strategy for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThrough brainstorming and exploring different strategies, I determined that using modular arithmetic alongside the Chinese Remainder Theorem was the most efficient method to find the last three digits of \\(9^{105}\\). By carefully calculating \\(9^{105} \\mod 8\\) and \\(9^{105} \\mod 125\\), and then applying CRT, I arrived at the final answer: **049**. Regular reflections and checks throughout the process ensured the correctness of each step, leading to a reliable solution.",
