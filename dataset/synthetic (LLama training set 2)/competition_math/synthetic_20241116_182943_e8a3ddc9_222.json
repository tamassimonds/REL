    "working_out": "Of course! Let's dive into this problem as if we're tackling it ourselves, exploring different strategies, reflecting, and checking our work regularly. Here's how I would naturally think through converting the point \\((-2, -2\\sqrt{3}, -1)\\) from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, so we're given a point in rectangular coordinates \\((x, y, z) = (-2, -2\\sqrt{3}, -1)\\). The goal is to convert it to cylindrical coordinates \\((r, \\theta, z)\\). I remember that cylindrical coordinates involve a radial distance \\(r\\) in the \\(xy\\)-plane, an angle \\(\\theta\\), and a height \\(z\\). \n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Recalling Formulas:** I think the conversion involves computing \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\) using \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) remains the same.\n- **Alternative Approaches:** Maybe there's another way to visualize it, like projecting the point onto the \\(xy\\)-plane and then finding the angle and radius from there.\n\n**Reflection:**\nDoes this approach make sense? Yes, because cylindrical coordinates are essentially an extension of polar coordinates into three dimensions, where the \\(z\\)-coordinate stays unchanged.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's proceed by calculating \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\) using the given \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating \\(r\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo find \\(r\\), I recall that it's the distance from the origin in the \\(xy\\)-plane. The formula is:\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nx = -2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -2\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2\\sqrt{3})^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{4 + 4 \\times 3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{4 + 12}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{16}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait, that seems right because \\(\\sqrt{16} = 4\\). The calculations add up.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe radial distance \\(r\\) is 4, which feels reasonable given the coordinates.\n\n**Action:**\nNow that \\(r = 4\\), let's move on to finding \\(\\theta\\).\n\n### **Step 3: Determining \\(\\theta\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\\(\\theta\\) is the angle in the \\(xy\\)-plane, measured from the positive \\(x\\)-axis. I remember that we can use the tangent function:\n\n\\[\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{y}{x}\n\\]\n\nBut before diving in, I need to consider the signs of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to determine the correct quadrant for \\(\\theta\\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Since both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are negative, the point is in the third quadrant.\n- Therefore, \\(\\theta\\) should be between \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\nFirst, compute \\(\\tan(\\theta)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{3}}{-2} = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, find \\(\\theta\\):\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\arctan(\\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nI know that \\(\\arctan(\\sqrt{3})\\) corresponds to \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), but since we're in the third quadrant, we need to add \\(\\pi\\) to this angle.\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\pi = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Yes, \\(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\) is in the third quadrant, aligning with the signs of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n**Action:**\nSo, \\(\\theta = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's briefly check if the approach is correct. We calculated \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\) based on the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) values, considering the quadrant for \\(\\theta\\). This aligns with the standard conversion from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates.\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything seems to be in order. The calculations are straightforward and the angles make sense for the given coordinates.\n\n**Action:**\nProceed with the final solution.\n\n### **Step 5: Assembling the Cylindrical Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I just need to write the cylindrical coordinates in the form \\((r, \\theta, z)\\). We have \\(r = 4\\), \\(\\theta = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\), and \\(z = -1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nDoes this look correct? Yes, all components are accounted for, and the signs are consistent with the original rectangular coordinates.\n\n**Action:**\nWrite down the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(4, \\frac{4\\pi}{3}, -1)}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let's double-check the calculations and make sure everything aligns with the cylindrical coordinate system.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Radial Distance (\\(r\\))**: Calculated correctly as 4.\n- **Angle (\\(\\theta\\))**: Adjusted for the third quadrant, resulting in \\(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\).\n- **Height (\\(z\\))**: Remains unchanged at \\(-1\\).\n\n**Action:**\nEverything checks out. The cylindrical coordinates accurately represent the original rectangular point.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically calculating \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\) while ensuring the correct quadrant for \\(\\theta\\), we've successfully converted the rectangular coordinates \\((-2, -2\\sqrt{3}, -1)\\) to cylindrical coordinates \\((4, \\frac{4\\pi}{3}, -1)\\). Throughout the process, I reflected on each step, checked my calculations, and adjusted my approach as needed to ensure accuracy.",
