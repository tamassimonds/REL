I\u2019ll start by understanding the question, exploring different strategies, checking if they make sense, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let\u2019s keep it conversational and think out loud, just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**User Query:**  \nFind the distance between the points \\((-5, -2)\\) and \\((7, 3)\\).\n\nWhen I first see this, I recognize it as a problem involving finding the distance between two points in a two-dimensional space. This immediately reminds me of the **distance formula** from coordinate geometry. But before jumping in, let me brainstorm a bit to explore different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Distance Formula:**  \n   I remember there\u2019s a specific formula for calculating the distance between two points in a coordinate plane. This seems the most direct approach.\n\n2. **Graphical Representation:**  \n   Maybe I could plot these points on a graph to visualize the distance and see if that helps in understanding. However, without a visual aid here, this might be tricky.\n\n3. **Pythagorean Theorem:**  \n   Another thought is to use the Pythagorean theorem, considering the distance as the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.\n\n4. **Coordinate Properties:**  \n   Perhaps looking at the properties of the coordinates themselves might provide some insight, like identifying parallel or perpendicular lines, but that feels like overcomplicating it for just finding a distance.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe **distance formula** sounds like the most straightforward and reliable method. The Pythagorean theorem also aligns closely with it since the distance formula is derived from that theorem. Plotting the points would be helpful for visualization but isn\u2019t necessary for solving algebraically.\n\n**Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll go with the **distance formula** to find the exact distance numerically. If needed, I can cross-check using the Pythagorean theorem approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Distance Formula**\n\nThe **distance formula** is given by:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\n**Assigning Coordinates:**  \nLet\u2019s assign the coordinates to the formula:\n- \\( (x_1, y_1) = (-5, -2) \\)\n- \\( (x_2, y_2) = (7, 3) \\)\n\n**Plugging into the Formula:**\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(7 - (-5))^2 + (3 - (-2))^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(7 + 5)^2 + (3 + 2)^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{12^2 + 5^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{144 + 25}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{169}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = 13\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThe calculation leads to a distance of **13**. Let me double-check the arithmetic to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **(7 + 5)** correctly equals **12**.\n- **(3 + 2)** correctly equals **5**.\n- **12^2** is **144**.\n- **5^2** is **25**.\n- **144 + 25** adds up to **169**.\n- The square root of **169** is indeed **13**.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe calculation seems correct. The distance is **13** units.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nJust to ensure the robustness of the solution, let's approach it using the **Pythagorean theorem**, which is essentially what the distance formula is based on.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nVisualize the points as forming a right triangle where:\n- The difference in x-coordinates (\\(x_2 - x_1\\)) is one leg.\n- The difference in y-coordinates (\\(y_2 - y_1\\)) is the other leg.\n- The distance \\(d\\) is the hypotenuse.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in x-coordinates} = x_2 - x_1 = 7 - (-5) = 12\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in y-coordinates} = y_2 - y_1 = 3 - (-2) = 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(12)^2 + (5)^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nAgain, we arrive at a distance of **13**. This confirms the accuracy of our initial method.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUsing the Pythagorean theorem yields the same result, validating the distance formula approach. It\u2019s always good to cross-check using different methods to ensure the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Validation:** Both the distance formula and the Pythagorean theorem led to the same answer, ensuring the reliability of the solution.\n- **Error Checking:** Throughout the process, I checked each step\u2019s arithmetic to avoid computational errors.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** While the graphical method wasn\u2019t utilized due to the lack of visual tools, it could help in understanding the problem better in a physical setting.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe distance between the points \\((-5, -2)\\) and \\((7, 3)\\) is **13** units. By exploring different strategies and verifying our calculations, we ensured the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step approach, complete with brainstorming, reflections, and checks, provides a clear and human-like problem-solving experience!",
