    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle the problem **\"Find the remainder when \\( 24^{50} - 15^{50} \\) is divided by 13.\"** I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore each step, reflect, and keep checking if my approach is correct, adjusting as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it manually.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **User Query:** Find the remainder when \\( 24^{50} - 15^{50} \\) is divided by 13.\n  \n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  - This reminds me of problems involving modular arithmetic, especially with exponents.\n  - It feels similar to using Fermat's Little Theorem, but I'm not entirely sure yet.\n  - I wonder if reducing the bases modulo 13 would help simplify things.\n\n- **Exploration:**  \n  - **Option 1:** Reduce both bases \\( 24 \\) and \\( 15 \\) modulo \\( 13 \\) to simplify exponents.\n  - **Option 2:** Use Fermat's Little Theorem since \\( 13 \\) is a prime.\n  - **Option 3:** Directly compute the remainders for smaller exponents to look for a pattern.\n  - **Option 4:** Check if there's a symmetry or cancellation that might simplify \\( 24^{50} - 15^{50} \\).\n\nI think starting by reducing the bases modulo 13 makes sense, as it might simplify the calculations significantly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Reducing the Bases Modulo 13**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Goal:** Simplify \\( 24^{50} - 15^{50} \\) by reducing \\( 24 \\) and \\( 15 \\) modulo \\( 13 \\).\n  \n- **Calculations:**  \n  - \\( 24 \\div 13 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 11 \\).  \n    **So, \\( 24 \\equiv 11 \\mod 13 \\).**\n\n  - \\( 15 \\div 13 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 2 \\).  \n    **So, \\( 15 \\equiv 2 \\mod 13 \\).**\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  - Now the problem becomes \\( 11^{50} - 2^{50} \\mod 13 \\).\n  - This looks more manageable because the bases are smaller.\n\n**Check:**  \n- Does reducing the bases make sense?  \n  - **Answer:** Yes, because working with smaller numbers often simplifies modular exponentiation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying Fermat's Little Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Recall Fermat's Little Theorem:**  \n  - If \\( p \\) is a prime and \\( a \\) is not divisible by \\( p \\), then \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\).\n  \n- **Application:**  \n  - Here, \\( p = 13 \\), so \\( a^{12} \\equiv 1 \\mod 13 \\) for \\( a \\) not divisible by \\( 13 \\).\n  - Both \\( 11 \\) and \\( 2 \\) are less than \\( 13 \\) and not divisible by \\( 13 \\).\n\n**Calculations Using Fermat\u2019s Theorem:**\n\n- **For \\( 11^{50} \\mod 13 \\):**  \n  - \\( 50 \\div 12 = 4 \\) with a remainder of \\( 2 \\).  \n    **So, \\( 11^{50} \\equiv (11^{12})^4 \\times 11^2 \\equiv 1^4 \\times 11^2 \\equiv 11^2 \\mod 13 \\).**\n\n  - **Calculating \\( 11^2 \\mod 13 \\):**  \n    - \\( 11^2 = 121 \\).  \n    - \\( 121 \\div 13 = 9 \\) with a remainder of \\( 4 \\).  \n      **So, \\( 11^{50} \\equiv 4 \\mod 13 \\).**\n\n- **For \\( 2^{50} \\mod 13 \\):**  \n  - Similarly, \\( 2^{50} \\equiv (2^{12})^4 \\times 2^2 \\equiv 1^4 \\times 2^2 \\equiv 2^2 \\mod 13 \\).\n  \n  - **Calculating \\( 2^2 \\mod 13 \\):**  \n    - \\( 2^2 = 4 \\).  \n    **So, \\( 2^{50} \\equiv 4 \\mod 13 \\).**\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Both \\( 11^{50} \\) and \\( 2^{50} \\) reduce to \\( 4 \\) modulo \\( 13 \\).  \n- This suggests that \\( 11^{50} - 2^{50} \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\), meaning the difference is divisible by \\( 13 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \n- Wait, both exponents result in \\( 4 \\mod 13 \\).  \n- **Quick Verification:**  \n  - \\( 11^{12} \\equiv 1 \\mod 13 \\), so any higher power is cyclical with period \\( 12 \\).\n  - \\( 50 \\div 12 = 4 \\) with a remainder of \\( 2 \\), matching \\( 2^2 \\).\n  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  - The calculations seem correct. Using Fermat's theorem simplifies the problem perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Simplifying the Expression:**  \n  - Now that we have \\( 11^{50} \\equiv 4 \\mod 13 \\) and \\( 2^{50} \\equiv 4 \\mod 13 \\),  \n  - The difference:  \n    \\[\n    24^{50} - 15^{50} \\equiv 4 - 4 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13\n    \\]\n\n- **Interpretation:**  \n  - The remainder when \\( 24^{50} - 15^{50} \\) is divided by \\( 13 \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n  \n**Reflection:**  \n- This makes sense because both terms are congruent modulo \\( 13 \\), so their difference is divisible by \\( 13 \\).\n- **Double-checking:**  \n  - Does this align with Fermat's Little Theorem? Yes, because both bases reduce to the same equivalent under exponentiation.\n  - No errors spotted in the earlier steps.\n\n**Check:**  \n- **Final Check:**  \n  - Repeating the calculations ensures consistency.\n  - Using Fermat's theorem was appropriate given the problem's structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n- The remainder when \\( 24^{50} - 15^{50} \\) is divided by \\( 13 \\) is **0**.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \n- **Brainstorming Worked:** Starting with reducing the bases modulo \\( 13 \\) was effective.\n- **Fermat's Little Theorem:** Applying it simplified the exponents significantly.\n- **Reflection Throughout:** Regular checks ensured the correctness of each step.\n- **Mistakes Avoided:** Considering different strategies early helped prevent dead ends.\n- **Natural Flow:** The thought process mimicked human problem-solving\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting as needed.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with continuous reflection and checking, led to a confident and correct conclusion.",
