Let's dive into this problem, treating it like a human would by brainstorming, experimenting with different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking for correctness along the way. Here\u2019s how I would approach finding the period of \\( y = \\tan x + \\cot x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **What is the period?** I remember that the period of a function is the smallest positive interval over which the function repeats its values. So, we're looking for the smallest \\( T > 0 \\) such that \\( \\tan(x + T) + \\cot(x + T) = \\tan x + \\cot x \\).\n\n- **Components to Consider:** The function involves both \\( \\tan x \\) and \\( \\cot x \\). I know that the period of \\( \\tan x \\) is \\( \\pi \\), and \\( \\cot x \\) is also \\( \\pi \\). But they\u2019re combined here, so maybe their periods interact in a specific way.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** \n    - Perhaps the periods of \\( \\tan x \\) and \\( \\cot x \\) align in some way, making the combined function repeat at that interval.\n    - Maybe I can use trigonometric identities to simplify the function, which might help in determining the period.\n    - Alternatively, consider whether this function has a period that\u2019s a multiple of \\( \\pi \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Using Trigonometric Identities**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Perhaps I can simplify \\( \\tan x + \\cot x \\) using trigonometric identities. If the expression becomes a standard trigonometric function, it might be easier to identify the period.\n\n- **Action:** Recall the identity \\( \\tan x + \\cot x = 2 \\sec(2x) \\), which I think is correct. Let\u2019s verify this.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Recollection:** \n    - I know that \\( \\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} \\) and \\( \\cot x = \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x} \\).\n    - Adding them: \n      \\[\n      \\tan x + \\cot x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} + \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\frac{\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x}{\\sin x \\cos x} = \\frac{1}{\\sin x \\cos x} = \\frac{2}{\\sin 2x} = 2 \\csc 2x\n      \\]\n      \n- **Realization:** Wait, I seem to have misremembered. It actually simplifies to \\( 2 \\csc 2x \\), not \\( 2 \\sec 2x \\).\n\n- **Correction:** So, \\( \\tan x + \\cot x = 2 \\csc 2x \\). This is helpful because \\( \\csc 2x \\) has a known period.\n\n**Check:** \n- \\( \\csc x \\) has a period of \\( 2\\pi \\), so \\( \\csc 2x \\) would have a period of \\( \\pi \\).\n- Multiplying by 2 doesn\u2019t affect the period.\n\n**Reflection:** This seems like a promising direction. By expressing \\( \\tan x + \\cot x \\) in terms of \\( \\csc 2x \\), I can leverage the known period of \\( \\csc \\) functions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Simplified Expression**\n\n**Action:**\n\n- Given that \\( \\tan x + \\cot x = 2 \\csc 2x \\), determine the period of \\( 2 \\csc 2x \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n  \n- \\( \\csc 2x \\) has a period of \\( \\pi \\) because:\n  \\[\n  \\csc 2x = \\frac{1}{\\sin 2x}\n  \\]\n  and \\( \\sin 2x \\) has a period of \\( \\pi \\).\n\n- Therefore, multiplying by 2 doesn\u2019t change the period:\n  \\[\n  T = \\pi\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n  \n- **Quick Check:** Does \\( 2 \\csc 2x \\) exhibit repetitive behavior every \\( \\pi \\) units? Yes, because the sine function in the denominator repeats every \\( \\pi \\), and scaling by 2 does not affect this periodicity.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Since both \\( \\tan x \\) and \\( \\cot x \\) have a period of \\( \\pi \\), and their combination \\( \\tan x + \\cot x \\) simplifies to \\( 2 \\csc 2x \\), which also has a period of \\( \\pi \\), it aligns with my initial thought that the periods of the component functions play a crucial role.\n\n- **Checking for Mistakes:** I initially thought of \\( \\sec 2x \\), but correcting it to \\( \\csc 2x \\) makes all the difference. Ensuring the correct trigonometric identity is vital here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Action:**\n\n- To ensure that \\( T = \\pi \\) is indeed the smallest positive period, I'll check if \\( \\tan(x + \\pi) + \\cot(x + \\pi) = \\tan x + \\cot x \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Compute \\( y(x + \\pi) \\):\n  \\[\n  y(x + \\pi) = \\tan(x + \\pi) + \\cot(x + \\pi)\n  \\]\n  - Recall that \\( \\tan(x + \\pi) = \\tan x \\) and \\( \\cot(x + \\pi) = \\cot x \\).\n  - Therefore:\n    \\[\n    y(x + \\pi) = \\tan x + \\cot x = y(x)\n    \\]\n    \n**Check:**\n  \n- **Does this hold true?** Yes, \\( y(x + \\pi) = y(x) \\), confirming that \\( \\pi \\) is indeed a period.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is there a smaller period?** By examining the individual periods of \\( \\tan x \\) and \\( \\cot x \\), which both are \\( \\pi \\), and considering the simplification to \\( 2 \\csc 2x \\), there doesn\u2019t appear to be a smaller period that satisfies the condition. Therefore, \\( T = \\pi \\) is the smallest positive period.\n\n- **Final Check:** The approach aligns with the properties of trigonometric functions, and the periodicity checks validate the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Summarizing the Findings**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n- The period of \\( y = \\tan x + \\cot x \\) is \\( T = \\pi \\).\n\n**Thought Process Summary:**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Considered the individual periods of \\( \\tan x \\) and \\( \\cot x \\) and thought about simplifying the function using trigonometric identities.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Attempted to simplify the function, initially misremembering the identity but correcting it to \\( \\tan x + \\cot x = 2 \\csc 2x \\).\n\n- **Applying the Simplified Expression:** Recognized that \\( 2 \\csc 2x \\) has a period of \\( \\pi \\), confirming that \\( T = \\pi \\).\n\n- **Verifying the Solution:** Checked that \\( y(x + \\pi) = y(x) \\) and ensured there\u2019s no smaller period.\n\n- **Reflection and Checks:** Throughout, made sure the trigonometric identities were applied correctly and that the periodicity was consistent with known properties.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Using trigonometric identities to simplify the expression was effective in determining the period.\n\n- **Mistakes and Corrections:** Initially misidentifying \\( \\sec 2x \\) instead of \\( \\csc 2x \\), but correcting it led to the correct solution.\n\n- **Key Insight:** Recognizing that the combination of \\( \\tan x \\) and \\( \\cot x \\) simplifies to a well-known periodic function was crucial in finding the period.\n\n- **Final Check:** Everything aligns with the properties of trigonometric functions, and all checks confirm the correctness of the period.\n\n---\n\nBy following this step-by-step approach, reflecting on each stage, and verifying the correctness, I've confidently determined that the period of \\( y = \\tan x + \\cot x \\) is \\( \\pi \\).",
