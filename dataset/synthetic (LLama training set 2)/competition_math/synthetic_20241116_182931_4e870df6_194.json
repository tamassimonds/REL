    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking human thought processes with brainstorming, reflections, and checks along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, my immediate reaction is:\n\n- **Recalling Similar Problems:** This looks like a geometry problem I've encountered before, particularly related to maximizing area with a fixed perimeter.\n  \n- **Initial Confusion:** I'm not entirely sure how changing the shape from a rectangle to a square impacts the area, especially since the perimeter remains the same.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Maybe I can relate the perimeter and area formulas or perhaps visualize the transition from a rectangle to a square.\n\n- **Feeling:** Wait, I need to recall how perimeter relates to area in different shapes.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate Perimeter First:**\n   - I could find the perimeter of the original rectangle and verify how it relates to the square.\n\n2. **Compare Areas Directly:**\n   - Calculate the area of both the rectangle and square to see the difference.\n\n3. **Use Algebraic Equations:**\n   - Set up equations relating the perimeters and areas to find the difference.\n\n4. **Geometric Visualization:**\n   - Visualize how rearranging the garden's shape could maximize the area.\n\n- **Reflection:** Starting with the **perimeter** seems logical since the problem specifies using the same fence. From there, I can explore how this perimeter relates to both shapes' areas.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Perimeter of the Rectangular Garden**\n\n- **Given Dimensions:** Length = 50 feet, Width = 10 feet.\n\n- **Perimeter Formula for a Rectangle:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) \n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  = 2 \\times (50 + 10) = 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  - **Check:** This makes sense because the perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle. Adding the length and width together and multiplying by 2 seems straightforward.\n  \n  - **Does it feel right?** Yes, just a quick calculation, and it aligns with the formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Transition to a Square Garden**\n\n- **Observation:** The problem states that the garden's shape changes to a square while using the same **perimeter** (120 feet).\n\n- **Initial Confusion:**  \n  - **Wait:** So, the perimeter remains 120 feet. But how does that affect the side length of the square?\n  \n  - **Recollecting Geometry:** The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. Since all sides are equal, I can divide the total perimeter by four to find the side length.\n\n- **Realization:**  \n  - **Oh!** This is similar to solving for the side length of a square when the perimeter is given.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Side Length of the Square Garden**\n\n- **Perimeter Formula for a Square:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\times \\text{Side length}\n  \\]  \n  - **Given Perimeter:** 120 feet\n  \n  \\[\n  120 = 4 \\times \\text{Side length} \\implies \\text{Side length} = \\frac{120}{4} = 30 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  - **Check:** Dividing the perimeter by four makes sense because a square has four equal sides.\n  \n  - **Does it feel right?** Yes, this straightforward calculation aligns with the square's perimeter formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Areas of Both Gardens**\n\n#### **A. Area of the Original Rectangular Garden**\n\n- **Formula for Area:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = 50 \\times 10 = 500 \\text{ square feet}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  - **Quick Check:** Multiplying 50 by 10 is an easy calculation.\n  \n  - **Does it feel right?** Yes, the dimensions are clear, and the calculation is correct.\n\n#### **B. Area of the New Square Garden**\n\n- **Formula for Area:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\text{Side length}^2 = 30^2 = 900 \\text{ square feet}\n  \\]\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  - **Check:** Squaring the side length of the square gives the area.\n  \n  - **Does it feel right?** Yes, squaring 30 is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Increase in Area**\n\n- **Formula:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Increase in Area} = \\text{Area of Square} - \\text{Area of Rectangle} = 900 - 500 = 400 \\text{ square feet}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  - **Quick Check:** The difference in areas is 400 square feet.\n  \n  - **Does it feel right?** Yes, the square's area is significantly larger than the rectangle's, which aligns with the expectation when changing from a rectangle to a square using the same perimeter.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verify and Reflect on the Approach**\n\n- **Checking the Perimeter Calculation:**  \n  - **Perimeter of Rectangle:** \\(2 \\times (50 + 10) = 120\\) \u2014 Correct.\n  \n  - **Perimeter of Square Calculation:** \\(120 / 4 = 30\\) \u2014 Correct.\n\n- **Checking the Area Calculations:**  \n  - **Rectangle Area:** \\(50 \\times 10 = 500\\) \u2014 Correct.\n  \n  - **Square Area:** \\(30^2 = 900\\) \u2014 Correct.\n\n- **Final Check:**  \n  - **Increase in Area:** \\(900 - 500 = 400\\) \u2014 Correct.\n\n- **Thoughts:**  \n  - **Does everything align?** Yes, all calculations are consistent and correct.\n  \n  - **Is there another method I could have used?** While perimeter-based calculations worked well, I could also consider algebraic relationships between perimeters and areas. However, the current method is clear and direct.\n\n- **Feeling:**  \n  - **Confident?** Yes, the step-by-step approach led to a consistent and correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBy changing the garden's shape from a rectangle to a square while using the same fence, the garden's area enlarges by **400 square feet**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming and exploring different strategies, starting with calculating the perimeter proved effective. Transitioning to finding the square's side length and then calculating the areas of both shapes led to a clear understanding of the increase in the garden's area. Throughout the process, reflection and quick checks ensured the accuracy of each step, reinforcing confidence in the final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "The area of the garden was 500 square feet$(50\\times 10)$ and its perimeter was 120 feet, $2\\times (50+10)$. The square garden is also enclosed by 120 feet of fence so its sides are each 30 feet long. The square garden's area is 900 square feet ($30\\times 30)$. and this has increased the garden area by $\\boxed{400}$ square feet.
