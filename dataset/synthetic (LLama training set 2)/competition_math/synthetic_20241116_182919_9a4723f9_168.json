    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a human's thought process. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting frequently, checking if my approach makes sense, and adjusting as needed. Let's see where this takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{(\\frac{1}{2})^{1}}+\\frac{1}{(\\frac{1}{2})^{2}}+\\frac{1}{(\\frac{1}{2})^{3}}}\n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is a mix of curiosity and confusion. It reminds me of fractional exponents and geometric series, but I'm not entirely sure how to connect those ideas right away. Here's what crosses my mind:\n\n- **Nested Fractions:** There are fractions within fractions. They seem to be structured in layers, which might complicate things.\n- **Powers of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\):** I notice that each term involves \\((\\frac{1}{2})^{n}\\) where \\(n\\) is increasing. This makes me think about geometric series or exponents.\n- **Reciprocal Sums:** The main denominator is a sum of reciprocals. Maybe simplifying those first could help.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not confident in this first glance. It feels like there might be a clever trick here, or perhaps it's just a straightforward simplification. Either way, I need to explore different strategies to see what works.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Simplify Inside Out:**\n   - Start by simplifying each term in the denominator individually.\n   - Then, add them up to see if the overall fraction simplifies neatly.\n\n2. **Exponent Rules:**\n   - Apply rules of exponents to see if there's a pattern or shortcut.\n   - Perhaps combine terms using properties of exponents.\n\n3. **Geometric Series Formula:**\n   - Recognize the sum as part of a geometric series.\n   - Use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series to simplify.\n\n4. **Alternative Representation:**\n   - Rewrite the expression in a different form, such as using negative exponents or converting to decimals temporarily.\n\nI'll start with the **Simplify Inside Out** approach because it seems straightforward. If that doesn't work, I'll move on to Exponent Rules or Geometric Series.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify Inside Out**\n\nLet's tackle each term in the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(\\frac{1}{2})^{1}} + \\frac{1}{(\\frac{1}{2})^{2}} + \\frac{1}{(\\frac{1}{2})^{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- I should compute each exponent first.\n- The reciprocal of \\((\\frac{1}{2})^{n}\\) is \\((2)^{n}\\). This seems straightforward.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. \\((\\frac{1}{2})^{1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n   - Reciprocal: \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\)\n\n2. \\((\\frac{1}{2})^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n   - Reciprocal: \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 4\\)\n\n3. \\((\\frac{1}{2})^{3} = \\frac{1}{8}\\)\n   - Reciprocal: \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{8}} = 8\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, that seems correct: \\(2\\), \\(4\\), and \\(8\\) are indeed the reciprocals of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), and \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) respectively.\n- This simplifies the denominator to \\(2 + 4 + 8\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Does \\(2 + 4 + 8 = 14\\)? Yes, that adds up correctly.\n\n**Result So Far:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2 + 4 + 8} = \\frac{1}{14}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- This simplification seems correct. The denominator adds up to \\(14\\), making the entire fraction \\(\\frac{1}{14}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's double-check if this makes sense:\n\n- **Original Expression:** The problem asked to simplify a nested fraction involving powers of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n- **Steps Taken:** I simplified each term in the denominator by computing the reciprocal of \\((\\frac{1}{2})^{n}\\).\n- **Outcome:** The denominator simplifies to \\(14\\), leading to the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{14}\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does \\(\\frac{1}{14}\\) make sense in the context of the problem? Yes, it\u2019s a valid simplification.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n- If I had used the Geometric Series approach, I would recognize that each term is part of a series with a common ratio. However, since the Simplify Inside Out method worked perfectly, there's no need to complicate things further.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n- **Ah!** This straightforward approach led me directly to the correct answer. It's always good to start simple and see if it works before considering more complex strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{14}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step process, reflecting on strategies, checking each step, and verifying the final outcome, led me confidently to the solution. The initial brainstorming helped guide the approach, and continuous reflection ensured accuracy throughout.",
