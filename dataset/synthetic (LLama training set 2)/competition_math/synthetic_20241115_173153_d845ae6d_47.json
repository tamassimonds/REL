    "working_out": "### First Thoughts\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, I see that it's about finding points on a circle that also lie on the \\( y \\)-axis. Off the top of my head, I remember that circles are defined by their center and radius, and that any point on the circle satisfies the circle's equation. \n\nI'm thinking I might need to:\n\n1. **Write down the equation of the circle.**\n2. **Determine what it means for a point to lie on the \\( y \\)-axis.**\n3. **Solve for the \\( y \\)-coordinates of the intersection points.**\n\nBut honestly, I'm a bit unsure if there's a more straightforward method. Maybe visualizing it could help, or perhaps checking if there's a simpler geometric approach.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Equation of the Circle:**\n   - Use the standard formula for a circle's equation and plug in the given center and radius.\n  \n2. **Substituting \\( x = 0 \\):**\n   - Since the points lie on the \\( y \\)-axis, substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the circle's equation to solve for \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Graphical Interpretation:**\n   - Sketching the circle and the \\( y \\)-axis might provide a visual clue about the solution.\n\n4. **Distance Formula:**\n   - Thinking about the distance from the center to the \\( y \\)-axis, but this seems more complicated for finding \\( y \\)-coordinates directly.\n\nInitially, the first two methods seem the most straightforward: writing the circle's equation and substituting \\( x = 0 \\). The graphical approach could confirm the algebraic solution, but it's less precise. The distance formula doesn't seem directly applicable here.\n\n### Step 1: Writing the Equation of the Circle\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the points on the circle, I need its equation. I recall that the standard form is:\n\n\\[\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\nWhere \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\nGiven:\n- Center \\( B(-6, 2) \\)\n- Radius \\( r = 10 \\) units\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n(x - (-6))^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 10^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(x + 6)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 100\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this look correct? Yes, the circle's equation seems standard, reflecting the given center and radius.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Points on the \\( y \\)-Axis\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nPoints on the \\( y \\)-axis have their \\( x \\)-coordinate equal to 0. So, I need to find where \\( x = 0 \\) intersects the circle.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the circle's equation:\n\n\\[\n(0 + 6)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n6^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n36 + (y - 2)^2 = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n(y - 2)^2 = 100 - 36\n\\]\n\\[\n(y - 2)^2 = 64\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait, squaring yields two possible solutions for \\( y \\): positive and negative roots. Let's solve for \\( y \\).\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\( y \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives two equations:\n\n\\[\ny - 2 = 8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y - 2 = -8\n\\]\n\nAdding 2 to each side to solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 10 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = -6\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\ny = 10 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = -6\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDo these \\( y \\)-coordinates make sense? Yes, they correspond to the points where the circle intersects the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Sum of the \\( y \\)-Coordinates\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of the \\( y \\)-coordinates of the intersection points. So, I just need to add the two values I found.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n10 + (-6) = 4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait, does this sum seem right? Adding 10 and -6 gives 4, which looks correct. But let me quickly reflect if the \\( y \\)-coordinates themselves are accurate.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the \\( y \\)-Coordinates\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's double-check the \\( y \\)-coordinates by plugging them back into the circle's equation to ensure they satisfy it.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. For \\( y = 10 \\):\n\n\\[\n(0 + 6)^2 + (10 - 2)^2 = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n36 + 64 = 100 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f}\n\\]\n\n2. For \\( y = -6 \\):\n\n\\[\n(0 + 6)^2 + (-6 - 2)^2 = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n36 + 64 = 100 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nBoth \\( y \\)-values satisfy the circle's equation, confirming their correctness.\n\n### Step 6: Final Reflection\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe approach seems solid. By writing the circle's equation and substituting \\( x = 0 \\), I found the correct \\( y \\)-coordinates. The sum checks out, and verification steps confirm the solution's accuracy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sum of the \\( y \\)-coordinates of the two points on circle \\( B \\) that are also on the \\( y \\)-axis is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\n### Final Check\n\nLet me do a quick final check to ensure everything aligns:\n\n- **Circle's Equation:** Correctly reflects center and radius.\n- **Substitution \\( x = 0 \\):** Led to accurate \\( y \\)-coordinates.\n- **Sum of \\( y \\)-Coordinates:** 10 + (-6) = 4, which is reasonable.\n- **Verification:** Both \\( y \\)-values satisfy the circle's equation.\n\nEverything looks good, and the solution seems complete and correct.",
