    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking how a human would naturally think through it. We'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking our work frequently, and making adjustments as needed. \n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, I see that \\( f(x) \\) is a piecewise function. That means the function behaves differently depending on the value of \\( x \\). Here\u2019s the definition again for clarity:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \nx^2 - 4 & \\text{if } x < 7 \\\\\nx - 13 & \\text{if } x \\geq 7 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Understanding Piecewise Functions:** \n   - I remember that with piecewise functions, I need to determine which part of the function to use based on the input value.\n   - Since we're dealing with multiple applications of \\( f \\), I have to be careful about each step and ensure I'm using the correct piece each time.\n\n2. **Sequential Evaluation:**\n   - We need to find \\( f(f(f(17))) \\). This means evaluating \\( f \\) three times in succession, starting from the innermost function.\n   - I should probably handle each application one at a time, checking the output before moving to the next.\n\n3. **Resolving Potential Confusion:**\n   - At first glance, I think, \u201cThis looks similar to evaluating functions I've done before, but the piecewise aspect adds complexity.\u201d\n   - I recall that misapplying the function piece can lead to wrong results, so I need to be meticulous.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I\u2019m feeling a bit uncertain about jumping straight in. Maybe mapping out each step will help clear things up.\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluating the Innermost Function \\( f(17) \\)**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Since 17 is greater than 7, I should use the second piece of the function: \\( f(x) = x - 13 \\).\n- But let me double-check to make sure I'm applying the correct piece.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nf(17) = 17 - 13 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \n- Wait, 17 is indeed greater than 7, so I think using \\( x - 13 \\) is correct.\n- The calculation seems straightforward\u2014subtracting 13 from 17 gives 4.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- That worked well. Now, I\u2019m ready to move to the next step using the output from this.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating the Second Function \\( f(f(17)) = f(4) \\)**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Now, I need to find \\( f(4) \\). Since 4 is less than 7, I should use the first piece: \\( f(x) = x^2 - 4 \\).\n- Let\u2019s make sure this transition is correct.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nf(4) = 4^2 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Yep, 4 is less than 7, so using \\( x^2 - 4 \\) makes sense.\n- Squaring 4 gives 16, and subtracting 4 results in 12.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This checks out. Moving on to the final step with the output being 12.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluating the Outer Function \\( f(f(f(17))) = f(12) \\)**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Now, I need to evaluate \\( f(12) \\). Since 12 is greater than 7, I\u2019ll use the second piece again: \\( f(x) = x - 13 \\).\n- I think this is straightforward, but let me confirm.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nf(12) = 12 - 13 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- 12 is indeed greater than 7, so using \\( x - 13 \\) is correct.\n- Subtracting 13 from 12 gives -1.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The result is negative, but that seems fine given the piecewise definition.\n- Everything seems to be on track so far.\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nAfter evaluating each step carefully and checking that the correct pieces of the function were applied, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\nf(f(f(17))) = -1\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- At first, I worried about misapplying the piecewise function, but by taking it step by step and reflecting at each stage, I ensured accuracy.\n- It helped to think through each part methodically, checking conditions for each function application.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- By brainstorming different strategies, evaluating each function step by step, and reflecting frequently, I arrived at the correct solution: \\( f(f(f(17))) = -1 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "We approach this problem by working from the inside out, so we first find $f(17)$. Since $17 \\geq 7$, $f(17) = 17 - 13 = 4$. Next, $4<7$, so $f(f(17))=f(4)=(4)^2-4=12$. Finally we have that since $12 \\geq 7$, $f(f(f(17)))=f(12)=12-13=\\boxed{-1}$."
