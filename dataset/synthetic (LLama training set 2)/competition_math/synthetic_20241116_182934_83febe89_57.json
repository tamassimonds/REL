    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and take it step by step, just like I would if I were solving it manually. The goal is to solve for \\( c \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} + \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, a few things come to mind:\n\n- **Nested Radicals:** The presence of square roots within square roots makes me think about simplifying nested radicals. This reminds me of problems where you might need to eliminate the innermost square root first.\n  \n- **Rationalizing Expressions:** Maybe rationalizing one side could help to make the equation more manageable.\n\n- **Squaring Both Sides:** This is a common technique to eliminate square roots, but doing it carelessly can introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll need to be careful.\n\n- **Comparing Both Sides:** Since the right side is a specific numerical value, perhaps simplifying the left side step-by-step to match the right side could work.\n\n### **Initial Strategy**\n\nI think starting by simplifying the left side step by step is a good approach. If that doesn\u2019t lead anywhere, I can consider squaring both sides or trying to rationalize. Let\u2019s begin by simplifying the left side.\n\n### **Step 1: Simplifying the Left Side**\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} + \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nLet's focus on simplifying \\( \\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} \\) first. \n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Maybe \\( \\sqrt{8 + 4c} \\) can be simplified.\n- If \\( \\sqrt{8 + 4c} \\) is a perfect square, that might make things easier.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\nI\u2019ll set \\( \\sqrt{8 + 4c} = k \\).\n  \n\\[\nk^2 = 8 + 4c \\\\\n4c = k^2 - 8 \\\\\nc = \\frac{k^2 - 8}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This doesn't immediately help. I still have \\( k \\) to deal with.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \n- Maybe it's better to focus on the whole expression rather than just \\( \\sqrt{8 + 4c} \\).\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet\u2019s try simplifying both square roots together.\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Square Roots Together**\n\nThe left side is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}} + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + c}}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Perhaps combining the square roots and simplifying in one go would be more effective.\n  \n**Exploration:**  \n- Consider squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, but maybe there\u2019s a simpler way.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**  \n- What if I assume \\( \\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}} = a \\) and \\( \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + c}} = b \\)? Then \\( a + b = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- But \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are still square roots, so this might complicate things.\n\n**Decision:**  \nMaybe it's better to attempt squaring the equation carefully to avoid introducing extraneous solutions.\n\n### **Step 3: Attempting to Square Both Sides**\n\nLet\u2019s square both sides to see if it helps.\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}} + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + c}})^2 = (2 + 2\\sqrt{2})^2\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}) + 2\\sqrt{(4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c})(2 + \\sqrt{2 + c})} + (2 + \\sqrt{2}) = 8 + 8\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s simplify the right side first:\n\n\\[\n(2 + \\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 4\\sqrt{2} + 2 = 6 + 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c} + 2\\sqrt{(4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c})(2 + \\sqrt{2 + c})} + 2 + \\sqrt{2} = 6 + 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{8 + 4c} + 2\\sqrt{(4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c})(2 + \\sqrt{2 + c})} = 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This is getting complicated. Perhaps squaring directly isn\u2019t the best path.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nMaybe I should try substituting values or look for a pattern.\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Specific Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Sometimes, guessing and checking with specific values can reveal patterns or possible solutions.\n- However, this might not be efficient without knowing the possible range of \\( c \\).\n\n**Decision:**  \nInstead of guessing specific \\( c \\) values, let's attempt another method that might simplify the equation better.\n\n### **Step 5: Re-examining the Nested Radicals**\n\nI recall that nested radicals can often be simplified by recognizing patterns or identities.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\nLet\u2019s see if \\( \\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}} \\) can be simplified:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}} = \\sqrt{4 + (k)} \\quad \\text{where } k = \\sqrt{8 + 4c}\n\\]\n\n**Alternative Idea:**\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\( \\sqrt{4 + k} = m \\):\n\n\\[\nm^2 = 4 + k \\\\\nk = m^2 - 4\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Back:**\n\n\\[\nm^2 - 4 = \\sqrt{8 + 4c} \\\\\n(m^2 - 4)^2 = 8 + 4c\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This is getting more algebraic than I initially thought.\n- Perhaps handling both square roots simultaneously is causing more complexity.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet\u2019s tackle each square root individually and see if that leads to a clearer path.\n\n### **Step 6: Simplifying the First Square Root**\n\nFocus on the first square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}}\n\\]\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nLet\u2019s make a substitution to simplify \\( \\sqrt{8 + 4c} \\).\n\nSuppose \\( \\sqrt{8 + 4c} = k \\), then:\n\n\\[\nk^2 = 8 + 4c \\\\\n4c = k^2 - 8 \\\\\nc = \\frac{k^2 - 8}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Back:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4 + k}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- This substitution doesn\u2019t seem to lead to immediate simplification.\n- Maybe assuming specific forms for \\( k \\) could help.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**  \nPerhaps \\( k \\) can be expressed as a multiple of square roots of integers.\n\n**Example:**  \nLet\u2019s assume \\( k = a\\sqrt{2} \\), where \\( a \\) is an integer or rational number.\n\n\\[\n(a\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8 + 4c \\\\\n2a^2 = 8 + 4c \\\\\n4c = 2a^2 - 8 \\\\\nc = \\frac{2a^2 - 8}{4} = \\frac{a^2 - 4}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This leads to expressing \\( c \\) in terms of \\( a \\).\n- But without knowing \\( a \\), I still can\u2019t find a specific value for \\( c \\).\n\n**Decision:**  \nStill, this doesn't provide a direct solution. Perhaps I need a different strategy.\n\n### **Step 7: Attempting to Match the Right Side**\n\nLet\u2019s try to match the left side to the right side step by step.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}} + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + c}} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**First Square Root:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}}\n\\]\n\nWe know from earlier that:\n\n\\[\n4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c} = a^2 \\quad \\text{where } a = \\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}}\n\\]\n  \n**Second Square Root:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + c}} = b\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\na + b = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Squaring Both Sides Again:**\n\n\\[\na^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (2 + 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6 + 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nBut we already attempted this and it led to complications.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Squaring both sides seems to complicate things further.\n- Perhaps there\u2019s another simplification that can work.\n\n**Decision:**  \nI think squaring isn\u2019t helping. Let\u2019s reconsider how to simplify the square roots without squaring.\n\n### **Step 8: Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}} \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s try another substitution.\n\nLet \\( \\sqrt{8 + 4c} = k \\), then:\n\n\\[\nk^2 = 8 + 4c \\\\\n4c = k^2 - 8 \\\\\nc = \\frac{k^2 - 8}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Back to Original Square Root:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4 + k}\n\\]\n\n**Now, Recall the Right Side:**\n\nThe right side is \\( 2 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\), which is \\( 2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) \\).\n\n**Idea:**  \nPerhaps \\( \\sqrt{4 + k} \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n**Assumption:**  \nLet\u2019s assume \\( \\sqrt{4 + k} = 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n1 + \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{4 + k}\n\\]\n  \nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + k \\\\\n1 + 2 + 2\\sqrt{2} = 4 + k \\\\\n3 + 2\\sqrt{2} = 4 + k \\\\\nk = 3 + 2\\sqrt{2} - 4 \\\\\nk = -1 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute, \\( k = -1 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\).**  \n- But this seems odd because \\( k \\) represents \\( \\sqrt{8 + 4c} \\), and square roots cannot be negative. \n- The presence of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) being irrational here raises a flag. \n- However, re-evaluating, \\( 2\\sqrt{2} \\) is approximately \\( 2.828 \\), and subtracting 1 gives \\( 1.828 \\), which is positive.\n\n**Alternative Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s verify if \\( k = -1 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\) is consistent.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n\\[\nk = \\sqrt{8 + 4c}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n(-1 + 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8 + 4c \\\\\n1 - 4\\sqrt{2} + 8 = 4c \\\\\n9 - 4\\sqrt{2} = 4c \\\\\nc = \\frac{9 - 4\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\\\\nc = \\frac{9}{4} - \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This gives a specific value for \\( c \\), namely \\( \\frac{9}{4} - \\sqrt{2} \\).\n- **But is this correct?**  Let's check by substituting back into the original equation.\n\n### **Step 9: Checking the Proposed Solution**\n\nProposed solution: \n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{9}{4} - \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Substitute Back into the Original Equation:**\n\nLeft Side:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}} + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + c}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{9}{4} - \\sqrt{2} = 2.25 - 1.414 \\approx 0.836\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\( \\sqrt{8 + 4c} \\):**\n\n\\[\n8 + 4(0.836) = 8 + 3.344 = 11.344\n\\]\n  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{11.344} \\approx 3.37\n\\]\n  \n**Calculating \\( \\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{11.344}} \\):**\n\n\\[\n4 + 3.37 = 7.37\n\\]\n  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{7.37} \\approx 2.71\n\\]\n  \n**Calculating \\( \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + c}} \\):**\n\nFirst, find \\( 2 + c \\):\n\n\\[\n2 + 0.836 = 2.836\n\\]\n  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{2.836} \\approx 1.68\n\\]\n  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{2 + 1.68} = \\sqrt{3.68} \\approx 1.92\n\\]\n  \n**Total Left Side:**\n\n\\[\n2.71 + 1.92 = 4.63\n\\]\n  \n**Right Side:**\n\n\\[\n2 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2 + 2(1.414) = 2 + 2.828 = 4.83\n\\]\n  \n**Comparison:**\n\nLeft Side = 4.63  \nRight Side = 4.83  \n  \n**Difference:**\n\n\\[\n4.83 - 4.63 = 0.2\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \n- There is a discrepancy of 0.2 between the left and right sides.\n- This suggests that the proposed solution \\( c = \\frac{9}{4} - \\sqrt{2} \\) might be incorrect.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**  \nPerhaps I made an error in assuming \\( \\sqrt{4 + k} = 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n**Mistake Identification:**  \nAssuming \\( \\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}} = 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\) led to a value of \\( c \\) that doesn\u2019t satisfy the original equation.\n\n**Decision:**  \nClearly, \\( c = \\frac{9}{4} - \\sqrt{2} \\) is not the correct solution. \n\n### **Step 10: Reflecting and Re-Brainstorming**\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- My initial assumption led to an incorrect solution.\n- It\u2019s possible that squaring both sides introduced errors or that the substitutions were flawed.\n\n**Alternative Strategies:**\n\n- **Try Squaring Carefully:** Even though I attempted squaring before, perhaps doing it step by step with careful checking might work.\n  \n- **Look for Symmetry:** The right side \\( 2 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\) suggests possible multiples of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). Perhaps the left side can be rearranged similarly.\n\n- **Consider Nested Radical Simplifications:** Perhaps recognizing patterns in nested radicals could simplify the expression without squaring.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet\u2019s try to simplify without squaring, looking for patterns or possible simplifications that match the right side.\n\n### **Step 11: Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}} \\) Again**\n\nLet\u2019s re-examine \\( \\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c}} \\).\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nPerhaps expressing \\( \\sqrt{8 + 4c} \\) in terms of \\( 2\\sqrt{2} \\) to match the right side.\n\n**Assumption:**  \nLet\u2019s assume \\( \\sqrt{8 + 4c} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8 + 4c \\\\\n8 = 8 + 4c \\\\\n4c = 0 \\\\\nc = 0\n\\]\n\n**Proposed Solution:**  \n\\( c = 0 \\)\n\n**Checking:**  \nLet\u2019s substitute \\( c = 0 \\) back into the original equation to verify.\n\n### **Step 12: Verifying \\( c = 0 \\)**\n\n**Left Side Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4(0)}} + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + 0}}\n\\]\n  \nSimplify step by step:\n\n1. **Innermost Radical:**\n   \n   \\[\n   8 + 4(0) = 8 \\\\\n   \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **First Square Root:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} \n   \\]\n   \n   - This doesn\u2019t simplify neatly, but let\u2019s leave it for now.\n   \n3. **Second Square Root:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} \n   \\]\n   \n   - This also doesn\u2019t simplify neatly, but let\u2019s approximate numerically.\n   \n**Numerical Approximation:**\n\nWithout exact simplifications, let\u2019s approximate using a calculator.\n\n1. **Calculate \\( \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.828 \\\\\n   4 + 2.828 \\approx 6.828 \\\\\n   \\sqrt{6.828} \\approx 2.61\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate \\( \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\\\\n   2 + 1.414 \\approx 3.414 \\\\\n   \\sqrt{3.414} \\approx 1.85\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Total Left Side:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2.61 + 1.85 \\approx 4.46\n   \\]\n   \n**Right Side Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n2 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2 + 2(1.414) = 2 + 2.828 = 4.828\n\\]\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nLeft Side = 4.46  \nRight Side = 4.828\n\n**Difference:**\n\n\\[\n4.828 - 4.46 \\approx 0.368\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \n- There is a discrepancy of approximately 0.368, which suggests that \\( c = 0 \\) might also not be the correct solution.\n- **Wait,** this makes me reconsider the approach.
