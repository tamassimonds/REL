    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like how I'd approach it if I were working through it naturally. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn\u2019t seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question:\n\n**User Query:** For two real values of \\( n \\), the equation \\( 9x^2 + nx + 36 = 0 \\) has exactly one solution in \\( x \\). What is the positive value of \\( n \\)?\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Hmm, this reminds me of quadratic equations and their discriminants. I recall that for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero. But let me think through this just to make sure.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Use the Discriminant Concept:** Recall that the discriminant of a quadratic equation determines the nature of its roots.\n  2. **Vertex Form Approach:** Consider the vertex of the parabola since if a quadratic has only one solution, the vertex lies on the x-axis.\n  3. **Completing the Square:** Rewrite the equation by completing the square to see the condition more clearly.\n\n- **Exploring the First Strategy:** Using the discriminant seems straightforward since it's a well-known property of quadratics. Let\u2019s start there.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Discriminant Concept**\n\n**Thought Process:** I remember that for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant \\( \\Delta \\) is given by \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\). If \\( \\Delta = 0 \\), the equation has exactly one solution.\n\n- **Given Equation:** \\( 9x^2 + nx + 36 = 0 \\)\n  - Here, \\( a = 9 \\), \\( b = n \\), and \\( c = 36 \\).\n\n- **Calculate the Discriminant:**\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = n^2 - 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 36 = n^2 - 1296\n  \\]\n  \n  **Reflection:** Wait, that makes sense because if \\( n^2 - 1296 = 0 \\), then \\( n^2 = 1296 \\), which would give two values for \\( n \\): \\( n = 36 \\) and \\( n = -36 \\).\n\n- **Check the Requirement:** The question asks for the positive value of \\( n \\), so \\( n = 36 \\) should be the answer.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Let\u2019s verify:\n  \\[\n  n^2 - 1296 = 1296 - 1296 = 0 \\quad (\\Delta = 0 \\Rightarrow \\text{one solution})\n  \\]\n  \n  **Conclusion:** This approach seems correct at first glance.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Solution Using the Vertex Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:** Just to ensure the correctness, let\u2019s consider the vertex of the parabola. For a quadratic equation to have only one solution, its vertex must lie on the x-axis.\n\n- **Formula for Vertex:** The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n  \n- **Apply to Given Equation:**\n  \\[\n  x = -\\frac{n}{2 \\cdot 9} = -\\frac{n}{18}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Condition for One Solution:** For the vertex to lie on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of the vertex should be zero. This means:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Vertex y-coordinate} = \\frac{4ac - b^2}{4a} = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  Substituting the values:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 36 - n^2}{4 \\cdot 9} = 0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1296 - n^2}{36} = 0 \\Rightarrow 1296 - n^2 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solve for \\( n \\):**\n  \\[\n  n^2 = 1296 \\Rightarrow n = \\pm 36\n  \\]\n  \n  **Reflection:** This aligns with our previous result. The positive value of \\( n \\) is \\( 36 \\).\n\n- **Check:** Both methods point to the same solution, which adds confidence to the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Completing the Square to Validate**\n\n**Thought Process:** Let me try another method\u2014completing the square\u2014to ensure consistency.\n\n- **Start with the Original Equation:**\n  \\[\n  9x^2 + nx + 36 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Divide Everything by 9 to Simplify:**\n  \\[\n  x^2 + \\frac{n}{9}x + 4 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Complete the Square:**\n  \\[\n  x^2 + \\frac{n}{9}x = \\left( \\frac{n}{18} \\right)^2 - \\left( \\frac{n}{18} \\right)^2\n  \\]\n  \n  So:\n  \\[\n  \\left( x + \\frac{n}{18} \\right)^2 - \\left( \\frac{n}{18} \\right)^2 + 4 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  Rearranging:\n  \\[\n  \\left( x + \\frac{n}{18} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{n}{18} \\right)^2 - 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Condition for One Solution:**\n  For there to be exactly one solution, the right side must be zero:\n  \\[\n  \\left( \\frac{n}{18} \\right)^2 - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow \\left( \\frac{n}{18} \\right)^2 = 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solve for \\( n \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{n}{18} = \\pm 2 \\Rightarrow n = \\pm 36\n  \\]\n  \n  **Reflection:** Again, we obtain \\( n = 36 \\) or \\( n = -36 \\). Since we're looking for the positive value, \\( n = 36 \\).\n\n- **Check:** This method also leads to the same solution, validating our earlier approaches.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:** Throughout the different methods\u2014discriminant, vertex approach, and completing the square\u2014all strategies consistently led to the same values for \\( n \\): \\( 36 \\) and \\( -36 \\). Given that the question asks for the positive value, \\( n = 36 \\) is the correct answer.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - **Discriminant Check:** \\( n^2 - 1296 = 0 \\) \u21d2 \\( n = \\pm 36 \\)\n  - **Vertex Approach:** Vertex condition satisfied at \\( n = \\pm 36 \\)\n  - **Completing the Square:** Led to the same \\( n \\) values\n\n- **Conclusion:** The positive value of \\( n \\) that satisfies the given condition is **\\( 36 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Approach Reflection:** Starting with the discriminant was a good choice as it's a direct application of a fundamental property of quadratic equations. Verifying with multiple methods ensured the solution's correctness and provided confidence in the result.\n\n- **Mistakes and Corrections:** Initially, I only considered the discriminant. By reflecting and checking, I realized it was beneficial to explore other strategies to confirm the answer.\n\n- **Learning Point:** Multiple approaches can lead to the same solution, reinforcing its validity. It's always helpful to cross-check using different methods, especially when dealing with quadratic equations.\n\n- **Final Insight:** Solving problems step by step, continuously reflecting, and being open to changing strategies is crucial for accurately tackling mathematical challenges. This approach mimics natural human problem-solving, ensuring a thorough and correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "If the quadratic expression on the LHS has exactly one root in $x$, then it must be a perfect square. Dividing 9 from both sides, we have $x^2+\\frac{n}{9}x+4=0$. In order for the LHS to be a perfect square, it must factor to either $(x+2)^2=x^2+4x+4$ or $(x-2)^2=x^2-4x+4$ (since the leading coefficient and the constant term are already defined). Only the first case gives a positive value of $n$, which is $n=4\\cdot9=\\boxed{36}$."
