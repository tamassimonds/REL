I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, checking if they make sense, and adjusting as needed, just like I would if I were tackling this on paper. Let's take it step by step, reflecting often to ensure we're on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nSo, the problem states:\n\n- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is \\((x + 3)\\).\n- Their least common multiple (LCM) is \\(x(x + 3)\\).\n- One of the integers is **40**.\n- We need to find the **smallest possible value** of the other integer.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This looks like a relationship between GCD and LCM that I might have seen before.\n- I remember there's a formula involving GCD and LCM: \n  \\[\n  \\text{GCD} \\times \\text{LCM} = \\text{Product of the two numbers}\n  \\]\n- However, I'm not immediately sure how the expressions involving \\(x\\) fit into this. Maybe I need to express both numbers in terms of \\(x\\)?\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the GCD-LCM Relationship:** Apply the formula above to relate GCD, LCM, and the two integers.\n  \n2. **Express Integers in Terms of \\(x\\):** Set up equations based on the given GCD and LCM expressions to find the integers.\n\n3. **Check Multiple Approaches:** If one method doesn't work, try another until it fits.\n\n**Possible Concerns:**\n\n- **Is \\(x\\) restricted to certain values?** Since \\(x\\) is a positive integer and GCD must divide 40, maybe \\(x + 3\\) is a divisor of 40?\n- **Does this lead to multiple possible values for the other integer?** If so, how do we determine the smallest?\n\n**Recalling Similar Problems:**\n\n- I've worked on problems involving GCD and LCM before, where expressing the integers in terms of their GCD and LCM led to a system of equations.\n- Maybe I could check if 40 fits the GCD and LCM conditions for some \\(x\\).\n\nAlright, let's try starting with the GCD-LCM relationship and see where it leads us.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the GCD-LCM Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince we know:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCD} \\times \\text{LCM} = \\text{Product of the two integers}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n\n- GCD = \\(x + 3\\)\n- LCM = \\(x(x + 3)\\)\n- One integer = 40\n\nLet's denote the other integer as \\(y\\). So, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x + 3) \\times x(x + 3) = 40 \\times y\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx(x + 3)^2 = 40y\n\\]\n\n**Checking if This Makes Sense:**\n\n- **Dimensional Analysis:** Both sides should have the same units (integers in this case), which they do since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers.\n- **Does \\(x(x + 3)^2 = 40y\\) help?** Not immediately clear how to solve for \\(y\\) directly unless we know \\(x\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis equation involves \\(x\\) squared and \\(x\\) cubed, making it difficult to isolate \\(y\\) without knowing \\(x\\). Maybe there's a better way to approach it by considering the properties of GCD and LCM.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**\n\nPerhaps I can relate \\(x + 3\\) (the GCD) with 40 to find \\(x\\), then use that \\(x\\) to find \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering GCD as a Divisor of 40**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait, the GCD of two numbers must divide both numbers, including 40. This implies that \\(x + 3\\) must be a divisor of 40.\n\n**Possible Divisors of 40:**\n\n- The positive divisors of 40 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40\n\n**Setting Up \\(x + 3\\):**\n\nSince \\(x + 3\\) is a divisor of 40, we can write:\n\n\\[\nx + 3 \\in \\{1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40\\}\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we can find possible values of \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\{1 - 3 = -2\\quad(\\text{not valid since } x \\text{ must be positive}),\n2 - 3 = -1\\quad(\\text{not valid}),\n4 - 3 = 1,\n5 - 3 = 2,\n8 - 3 = 5,\n10 - 3 = 7,\n20 - 3 = 17,\n40 - 3 = 37\\}\n\\]\n\nSo, the possible positive values of \\(x\\) are: **1, 2, 5, 7, 17, 37**\n\n**Checking Validity:**\n\n- **Is this approach correct?** It seems plausible because \\(x + 3\\) being a divisor of 40 aligns with the properties of GCD.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis method gives us possible \\(x\\) values. Now, I can use these \\(x\\) values to find corresponding \\(y\\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Corresponding \\(y\\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we have possible \\(x\\) values, let's see which ones lead to valid \\(y\\) values using the equation:\n\n\\[\nx(x + 3)^2 = 40y \\implies y = \\frac{x(x + 3)^2}{40}\n\\]\n\nWe need \\(y\\) to be an integer, so \\(x(x + 3)^2\\) must be divisible by 40.\n\n**Trying Each \\(x\\) Value:**\n\n1. **\\(x = 1\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{1 \\times (1 + 3)^2}{40} = \\frac{1 \\times 16}{40} = \\frac{16}{40} = 0.4\\quad(\\text{not an integer})\n   \\]\n\n2. **\\(x = 2\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{2 \\times (2 + 3)^2}{40} = \\frac{2 \\times 25}{40} = \\frac{50}{40} = 1.25\\quad(\\text{not an integer})\n   \\]\n\n3. **\\(x = 5\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{5 \\times (5 + 3)^2}{40} = \\frac{5 \\times 64}{40} = \\frac{320}{40} = 8\\quad(\\text{integer})\n   \\]\n\n4. **\\(x = 7\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{7 \\times (7 + 3)^2}{40} = \\frac{7 \\times 100}{40} = \\frac{700}{40} = 17.5\\quad(\\text{not an integer})\n   \\]\n\n5. **\\(x = 17\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{17 \\times (17 + 3)^2}{40} = \\frac{17 \\times 400}{40} = \\frac{6800}{40} = 170\\quad(\\text{integer})\n   \\]\n\n6. **\\(x = 37\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{37 \\times (37 + 3)^2}{40} = \\frac{37 \\times 1600}{40} = \\frac{59200}{40} = 1480\\quad(\\text{integer})\n   \\]\n\n**Valid \\(y\\) Values:**\n\nFrom this, \\(y\\) is an integer for \\(x = 5\\), \\(x = 17\\), and \\(x = 37\\). Let's list them:\n\n- \\(x = 5 \\Rightarrow y = 8\\)\n- \\(x = 17 \\Rightarrow y = 170\\)\n- \\(x = 37 \\Rightarrow y = 1480\\)\n\n**Checking Which is Smallest:**\n\nAmong these, the smallest possible value of \\(y\\) is **8**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach seems to work well. By considering \\(x + 3\\) as a divisor of 40, I narrowed down possible \\(x\\) values, and subsequently, calculated corresponding \\(y\\) values. It checks out because only for certain \\(x\\) values does \\(y\\) become an integer, aligning with the GCD-LCM relationship.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with the GCD-LCM Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's pick one of the valid \\(y\\) values, say \\(y = 8\\), and see if it satisfies the original GCD-LCM condition.\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\(x = 5\\)\n- \\(x + 3 = 8\\) (GCD)\n- \\(LCM = 5 \\times 8 = 40\\)\n- Product of integers = \\(GCD \\times LCM = 8 \\times 40 = 320\\)\n- Check if \\(40 \\times y = 320\\): \n  \\[\n  40 \\times 8 = 320\n  \\]\n  This holds true.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms that \\(y = 8\\) is correct. The GCD and LCM conditions are satisfied, and the equation balances.\n\n**Cross-Checking with Another \\(x\\) value:**\n\nLet's also check \\(x = 17\\) and \\(y = 170\\):\n\n- \\(x + 3 = 20\\) (GCD)\n- \\(LCM = 17 \\times 20 = 340\\)\n- Product of integers = \\(20 \\times 340 = 6800\\)\n- Check if \\(40 \\times y = 6800\\): \n  \\[\n  40 \\times 170 = 6800\n  \\]\n  This also holds true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth \\(x = 5, y = 8\\) and \\(x = 17, y = 170\\) satisfy the conditions. However, the problem asks for the **smallest** possible value of the other integer, which is **8**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Ensuring the Approach is Correct**\n\nThroughout the process, I:\n\n- **Brainstormed** different strategies, initially considering the GCD-LCM formula directly, which led to a dead end without knowing \\(x\\).\n- **Reflected** and **changed direction** by recognizing that \\(x + 3\\) must be a divisor of 40, narrowing down possible \\(x\\) values.\n- **Calculated** corresponding \\(y\\) values and checked which ones are integers.\n- **Verified** the solution by substituting back into the GCD-LCM formula to ensure consistency.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant checking and reflection, ensured that the solution is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe **smallest possible value** of the other integer is **8**.",

  "ground_truth": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 3) \\cdot x(x + 3)}{40} = \\frac{x(x + 3)^2}{40}.\\] To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nThis expression is not an integer for $x =$ 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when $x = 5$, this expression is $5 \\cdot 8^2/40 = 8$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 8 and 40 is 8, and $x + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8$.  The least common multiple is 40, and $x(x + 3) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 3) = 40$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{8}$."
