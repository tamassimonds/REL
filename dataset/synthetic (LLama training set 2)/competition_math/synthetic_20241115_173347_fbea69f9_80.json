    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. When I first see the question about Fermat numbers and finding the units digit of \\( F_{1000} \\), a few thoughts come to mind:\n\n1. **Fermat Numbers Definition**: I recall that Fermat numbers are of the form \\( F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 \\). This looks similar to powers of two, which might hint at patterns in their digits.\n\n2. **Units Digit Focus**: Since we're only concerned with the units digit, maybe there's a pattern or repetition in the units digits of Fermat numbers that we can exploit.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: I remember Fermat's conjecture that all Fermat numbers are prime, but we now know that's false. This makes me curious about the properties of these numbers, especially since \\( n = 1000 \\) is quite large.\n\n4. **Possible Strategies**: \n   - **Compute Small \\( n \\) to Find a Pattern**: Maybe calculating \\( F_n \\) for small \\( n \\) will reveal a repeating pattern in the units digits.\n   - **Modular Arithmetic**: Since we're only interested in the units digit, working modulo 10 might simplify things.\n   - **Investigate Powers of 2 Modulo 10**: Since \\( F_n \\) involves \\( 2^{2^n} \\), perhaps analyzing the units digits of powers of 2 could lead to a pattern.\n   - **Look for Theorems or Properties**: There might be number theory theorems that directly apply to Fermat numbers and their units digits.\n\nNow, I'll brainstorm which strategy might be the most effective and start with it. If that doesn't lead anywhere, I'll pivot to another approach.\n\n### Step 1: Investigating Powers of 2 Modulo 10\n\n**Thought Process**: Since \\( F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 \\), perhaps looking at the units digits of \\( 2^k \\) where \\( k = 2^n \\) could reveal a pattern. I know that powers of 2 have a repeating cycle in their units digits when taken modulo 10.\n\n**Strategy**:\n- First, determine the units digits of \\( 2^k \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 \\).\n- Check if there's a repeating pattern beyond that.\n- Once the pattern is identified, see where \\( 2^{2^n} \\) fits into this cycle.\n\n**Calculation**:\nLet's list the units digits of \\( 2^k \\) modulo 10:\n\n- \\( 2^0 \\mod 10 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 2^1 \\mod 10 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 2^2 \\mod 10 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 2^3 \\mod 10 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 2^4 \\mod 10 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 2^5 \\mod 10 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 2^6 \\mod 10 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 2^7 \\mod 10 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 2^8 \\mod 10 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 2^9 \\mod 10 = 2 \\)\n\n**Pattern Observation**: \n- The units digits repeat every 4 steps: \\( 2, 4, 8, 6 \\).\n\n**Reflection**: \n- Wait, this looks like a cycle of length 4. That suggests that \\( 2^k \\mod 10 \\) depends on \\( k \\mod 4 \\).\n- If this pattern holds, then for \\( n \\geq 2 \\), \\( 2^{2^n} \\mod 10 \\) would depend on \\( 2^n \\mod 4 \\).\n\n**Check**: \n- So, if \\( 2^n \\mod 4 \\) is always 0 for \\( n \\geq 2 \\), then \\( 2^{2^n} \\mod 10 \\) would always correspond to the 0 position in the cycle, which we haven't calculated yet. Let's see.\n\n### Step 2: Determining \\( 2^n \\mod 4 \\)\n\n**Thought Process**: \n- I need to confirm that \\( 2^n \\mod 4 \\) is indeed 0 for \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n- If \\( 2^n \\mod 4 = 0 \\), then \\( 2^{2^n} \\mod 10 \\) would map to the end of the cycle.\n\n**Calculation**:\n- \\( 2^1 = 2 \\mod 4 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 2^2 = 4 \\mod 4 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 2^3 = 8 \\mod 4 = 0 \\)\n- ...\n- Generally, for \\( n \\geq 2 \\), \\( 2^n \\) is a multiple of 4, so \\( 2^n \\mod 4 = 0 \\).\n\n**Reflection**: \n- This confirms that for \\( n \\geq 2 \\), \\( 2^n \\mod 4 = 0 \\).\n- Therefore, \\( 2^{2^n} \\mod 10 \\) corresponds to the 0 position in the cycle of the units digits of powers of 2.\n\n### Step 3: Mapping to the Cycle of Units Digits\n\n**Thought Process**: \n- From the previous steps, \\( 2^{2^n} \\mod 10 \\) corresponds to the 0 position in the cycle of units digits of \\( 2^k \\).\n- I need to identify what the 0 position maps to in the cycle.\n\n**Calculation**:\n- Let's extend the identified cycle: \\( 2, 4, 8, 6, \\text{?} \\).\n- To find the 0 position, let's look at higher powers of 2:\n  - \\( 2^4 = 16 \\mod 10 = 6 \\)\n  - \\( 2^5 = 32 \\mod 10 = 2 \\)\n  - \\( 2^6 = 64 \\mod 10 = 4 \\)\n  - \\( 2^7 = 128 \\mod 10 = 8 \\)\n  - \\( 2^8 = 256 \\mod 10 = 6 \\)\n  - ...\n- Notice that the cycle begins repeating every 4 steps: \\( 2, 4, 8, 6 \\).\n\n**Reflection**: \n- This suggests that the cycle restarts after every 4 steps.\n- Therefore, the \"0 position\" in terms of the cycle would correspond to the units digit of \\( 2^4 \\), which is 6.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation for \\( F_{1000} \\)\n\n**Thought Process**: \n- Now that I know \\( 2^{2^n} \\mod 10 \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\) corresponds to the units digit 6, I can find the units digit of \\( F_n \\).\n\n**Calculation**:\n- \\( F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 \\)\n- Since \\( 2^{2^n} \\mod 10 = 6 \\), then:\n  - \\( F_n = 6 + 1 = 7 \\mod 10 \\)\n\n**Reflection**: \n- This makes sense. The units digit of \\( F_n \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\) is consistently 7.\n- To double-check, let's look back at the earlier steps:\n  - The cycle of units digits was correctly identified.\n  - \\( 2^n \\mod 4 \\) was confirmed to be 0 for \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n  - Mapping to the cycle was done correctly.\n\n**Check**: \n- Does the pattern hold for small \\( n \\)?\n  - For \\( n = 2 \\): \\( F_2 = 2^{2^2} + 1 = 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 \\mod 10 = 7 \\)\n  - For \\( n = 3 \\): \\( F_3 = 2^{2^3} + 1 = 2^8 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257 \\mod 10 = 7 \\)\n  - For \\( n = 4 \\): \\( F_4 = 2^{2^4} + 1 = 2^{16} + 1 = 65536 + 1 = 65537 \\mod 10 = 7 \\)\n- This confirms that the units digit is indeed 7 for \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies and verifying each step, I've determined that the units digit of \\( F_{1000} \\) is **7**. By exploring the pattern in the units digits of powers of 2 and confirming that \\( 2^{2^n} \\mod 10 \\) always results in 6 for \\( n \\geq 2 \\), we can confidently conclude that \\( F_n \\) has a units digit of 7 for all \\( n \\geq 2 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\\boxed{7}$."
