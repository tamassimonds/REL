    "working_out": "Let's tackle this problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming along the way to ensure clarity and correctness. I'll simulate my thought process as naturally as possible, exploring various strategies, checking for correctness frequently, and being open to changing approaches if needed.\n\n## **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the equation:\n\n\\[\n22^2 \\times 55^2 = 10^2 \\times N^2\n\\]\n\nI think, \"This looks like an equation involving squares and products. Maybe I can simplify both sides to make \\( N \\) more apparent.\" \n\nAt the surface level, it reminds me of properties of exponents and squares. Perhaps factoring or using the distributive property could help. But honestly, I'm not sure which direction will lead me to the solution right away. \n\nI recall that \\( a^2 \\times b^2 = (a \\times b)^2 \\). Maybe applying that could simplify things. But then again, perhaps isolating \\( N^2 \\) would be more straightforward. \n\n## **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Simplify Both Sides**: Attempt to simplify the left and right sides separately to see if \\( N \\) becomes apparent.\n   \n2. **Use Properties of Exponents**: Leverage \\( (a \\times b)^2 = a^2 \\times b^2 \\) to possibly rewrite the equation.\n\n3. **Factorization**: Try factoring numbers to see if common terms can be canceled out.\n\n4. **Take Square Roots**: After simplifying, take the square root to solve for \\( N \\).\n\n5. **Numerical Calculation**: Perform step-by-step numerical calculations to find \\( N \\) directly.\n\nI'll start with simplifying both sides, as it seems like a natural starting point.\n\n## **Step 1: Simplify Both Sides**\n\n### **Approach**\n\nLet's expand both sides to see if simplification leads us closer to finding \\( N \\).\n\n### **Left Side Simplification**\n\n\\[\n22^2 \\times 55^2 = (22 \\times 55)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( 22 \\times 55 \\):\n\n\\[\n22 \\times 55 = 1210 \\quad \\text{(Wait, let me double-check this: \\( 22 \\times 50 = 1100 \\) and \\( 22 \\times 5 = 110 \\), so \\( 1100 + 110 = 1210\\))}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n(22 \\times 55)^2 = 1210^2\n\\]\n\n### **Right Side Simplification**\n\n\\[\n10^2 \\times N^2 = (10 \\times N)^2 = (10N)^2\n\\]\n\n### **Revised Equation After Simplification**\n\n\\[\n1210^2 = (10N)^2\n\\]\n\n**Checkpoint**: This looks cleaner. It's easier to see the relationship between \\( 1210^2 \\) and \\( (10N)^2 \\).\n\n## **Step 2: Relate the Two Sides Using Square Properties**\n\n### **Approach**\n\nSince both sides are perfect squares, we can equate their bases:\n\n\\[\n1210 = 10N\n\\]\n\n### **Solving for \\( N \\)**\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{1210}{10} = 121\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Wait, let me quickly verify this calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1210}{10} = 121 \\quad \\text{(This seems correct)}\n\\]\n\n## **Step 3: Verification**\n\n### **Approach**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's plug \\( N = 121 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies both sides.\n\n### **Left Side with \\( N = 121 \\)**\n\n\\[\n22^2 \\times 55^2 = 1210^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( 1210^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n1210^2 = 1464100 \\quad \\text{(Let me verify quickly: \\( 1210 \\times 1200 = 1210 \\times (1000 + 200) = 1210000 + 242000 = 1452000 \\), and \\( 1210 \\times 10 = 12100 \\), so \\( 1452000 + 12100 = 1464120 \\))}\n\\]\n\nWait, the calculation was slightly off. Let's recalculate \\( 1210^2 \\) more carefully:\n\n\\[\n1210 \\times 1210 = 1210 \\times (1200 + 10) = 1210 \\times 1200 + 1210 \\times 10\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1452000 + 12100 = 1464100 \\quad \\text{(Correct this time)}\n\\]\n\n### **Right Side with \\( N = 121 \\)**\n\n\\[\n10^2 \\times 121^2 = 100 \\times 14641 = 1464100\n\\]\n\n**Comparison**:\n\n\\[\n1464100 = 1464100 \\quad \\text{(Both sides are equal)}\n\\]\n\n## **Finalization**\n\nThe value of \\( N \\) that satisfies the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{121}\n\\]\n\n## **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: Recognized that the equation involves squares and products, prompting thoughts about properties of exponents.\n\n2. **Brainstorming Strategies**: Listed potential methods such as simplifying both sides, using exponent properties, and factoring.\n\n3. **First Attempt - Simplify Both Sides**: Started by simplifying the left side using \\( (a \\times b)^2 = a^2 \\times b^2 \\), leading to \\( 1210^2 = (10N)^2 \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( N \\)**: Equated the bases to find \\( N = 121 \\).\n\n5. **Verification**: Checked by plugging \\( N \\) back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal.\n\n6. **Reflection and Correction**: Adjusted initial miscalculations in squaring \\( 1210 \\) and confirmed the correct answer.\n\nThroughout, I checked my work frequently, reflected on each step, and was ready to change my approach if something didn't seem right. This ensured that the final answer is accurate and consistent with the original equation.",
