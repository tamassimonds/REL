    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem by thinking through it step by step, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and making adjustments along the way. It\u2019s important to simulate a natural human thought process, complete with brainstorming, checking work, and possibly realizing when a method needs to be changed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n**User Query:** Suppose \\( x \\) is a solution to \\( x^2 + 1 = 7x \\). What is the sum of \\( x \\) and its reciprocal?\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Okay, this looks like a quadratic equation. I recognize the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). It reminds me of problems where we solve for \\( x \\) using the quadratic formula or perhaps factoring.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** \n  - Maybe I can rearrange the equation to make it look like a standard quadratic equation.\n  - Alternatively, perhaps factoring could work if the numbers are friendly.\n  - Once I find \\( x \\), I need to calculate \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\), which is the sum of \\( x \\) and its reciprocal. That\u2019s a separate step that will require careful handling.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure which method will be the quickest or easiest, but starting with rearranging seems logical. Let's see where that leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To solve for \\( x \\), it makes sense to rearrange the given equation into the standard quadratic form.\n- This will help identify the coefficients needed for the quadratic formula if factoring doesn\u2019t pan out.\n\n**Action:**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 1 = 7x\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 7x \\) from both sides to bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 7x + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Is this in the standard form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\)? Yes, where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -7 \\), and \\( c = 1 \\).\n- **Thought:** Perfect! Now I can attempt to factor this or use the quadratic formula if factoring seems difficult.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Trying to Factor the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Perhaps \\( x^2 - 7x + 1 = (x - p)(x - q) \\). If I can find \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) such that their product is 1 and their sum is 7, that would work.\n- **Concern:** But, wait, the sum should be \\(-7\\), not \\(7\\). That\u2019s a bit off.\n\n**Action:**\n\nAttempting to factor:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 7x + 1 = (x - p)(x - q)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( p + q = 7 \\)\n- \\( pq = 1 \\)\n\n**Realization:**\n\n- **Mistake:** Oh wait, I miswrote it! The sum of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) should be \\( -7 \\), not \\( 7 \\).\n- **Thought:** Okay, let me correct this and see if I can find suitable \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n**Correction:**\n\n\\[\np + q = 7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad pq = 1\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\nq = \\frac{1}{p}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\np + \\frac{1}{p} = 7\n\\]\n\n**Action:**\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( p \\) to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\np^2 + 1 = 7p\n\\]\n\nRearrange to:\n\n\\[\np^2 - 7p + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Wait a minute, this looks identical to the original equation \\( x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0 \\).\n- **Thought:** That\u2019s odd. Did I just circle back to the original problem? Maybe factoring isn't the right path here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Deciding to Use the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Insight:** Since attempting to factor led me back to the original equation, and factoring doesn\u2019t seem straightforward, perhaps using the quadratic formula is more reliable.\n- **Sign:** This approach is more systematic and will definitely provide the roots without getting tangled.\n\n**Action:**\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -7 \\)\n- \\( c = 1 \\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-7) \\pm \\sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 1}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\nSimplify step by step:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 4}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{45}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{7 \\pm 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Did I compute the discriminant correctly? Let\u2019s see:\n  - \\( (-7)^2 = 49 \\)\n  - \\( 4 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 4 \\)\n  - Difference: \\( 49 - 4 = 45 \\), which is correct.\n\n- **Thought:** This seems right. I now have two possible solutions for \\( x \\):\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{7 + 3\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{7 - 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Pause:** Both solutions are valid, but the problem asks for the sum of \\( x \\) and its reciprocal. It doesn\u2019t specify which \\( x \\) to use, so perhaps it's safe to assume we're looking for a general expression that applies to any valid \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Sum of \\( x \\) and Its Reciprocal**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Task:** Find \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\).\n- **Realization:** I have two solutions for \\( x \\), but adding them wouldn't make sense. Instead, I should consider that for any solution \\( x \\), \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\) is a constant value derived from the equation.\n\n- **Insight:** Perhaps there's a relationship that simplifies this calculation. Let\u2019s explore that.\n\n**Action:**\n\nLet's consider the given equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 7x + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Idea:**\n\nMultiply both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{x} - \\frac{7x}{x} + \\frac{1}{x} = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nx - 7 + \\frac{1}{x} = 0\n\\]\n\n**Rearrange to find \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\):**\n\n\\[\nx + \\frac{1}{x} = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because multiplying both sides by \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) is a valid operation as long as \\( x \\neq 0 \\).\n- **Thought:** Wait, this is neat! I didn\u2019t even need to solve for \\( x \\) explicitly to find the sum. The equation itself provides the answer directly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Check:** Is there any flaw in multiplying by \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\)? Since \\( x \\neq 0 \\) (as \\( x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0 \\) has solutions), this step is valid.\n- **Reflection:** Does this align with the original problem\u2019s request? Yes, it directly answers the question by providing \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\).\n\n**Action:**\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\[\nx + \\frac{1}{x} = 7\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Re-examine:** Does this result make sense in the context of the original equation? Yes, because we derived it directly from the equation.\n- **Thought:** No inconsistencies spotted. The method worked smoothly, leading to the correct answer without unnecessary complexity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy brainstorming and initially attempting to factor the quadratic equation, I realized that factoring led me back to the original problem, indicating that it might not be the most straightforward path. Switching gears, I applied the quadratic formula to find the solutions for \\( x \\). However, a more elegant approach emerged when I multiplied the original equation by \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\), directly yielding \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} = 7 \\) without needing to solve for \\( x \\) explicitly.\n\nThis approach not only simplified the process but also ensured accuracy by adhering closely to the properties of the given equation. Reflecting throughout ensured that potential missteps were caught early, maintaining the integrity of the solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nx + \\frac{1}{x} = 7\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step simulation captures the natural thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflections, checks, and adjustments, ensuring a comprehensive and human-like approach to problem-solving.",

  "ground_truth": "We rearrange our equation: $x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0$. Then, we use the quadratic equation to solve for $x$: $$x = \\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{(-7)^2-(4)(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{7\\pm 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}.$$ The two possible values of $x$ are reciprocals of each other. Here's why: \\begin{align*}\\frac{1}{(7+3\\sqrt{5})/2} &= \\frac{2}{7+3\\sqrt{5}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2}{7+3\\sqrt{5}}\\cdot\\frac{7-3\\sqrt{5}}{7-3\\sqrt{5}} \\\\\n&=\\frac{2(7-3\\sqrt{5})}{7^2 - (3\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{2(7-3\\sqrt{5})}{4} = \\frac{7-3\\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, our answer is $$\\frac{7 + 3\\sqrt{5}}{2} + \\frac{7 - 3\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\boxed{7}.$$\n\n- OR -\n\nWe want the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal.
