    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive deep into this problem and think through it just like we would if we were tackling it on paper.\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first look at the question, I see that it's about a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, and the walls are being moved from \\(x = a\\) to \\(x = 4a\\). My initial reaction is that this involves quantum mechanics, specifically the energy levels of a particle in a box. \n\n- **Initial Ideas:**\n  - **Quantum Mechanics:** I remember that the energy levels in a one-dimensional infinite well are quantized, and this is related to the width of the well.\n  - **Work Done Calculation:** Since the walls are being moved, perhaps the work done relates to the change in energy levels or the wave functions of the particle.\n  - **Energy Expression Provided:** The energy is given as \\(E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2ma^2}\\), which looks familiar from the energy level equations in quantum wells.\n\n- **Uncertainties:**\n  - I'm not entirely sure how the change in the width of the well translates directly to work done.\n  - The factor of 4 in moving from \\(a\\) to \\(4a\\) seems significant, but I can't connect all the dots immediately.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Energy Level Comparison:** Calculate the initial and final energy levels and find the difference.\n  2. **Wave Function Consideration:** Look at how the wave functions change with the well's width.\n  3. **Integration Method:** Consider integrating the force over the displacement to find work done.\n\nI think starting with energy level comparison makes the most sense since the energy expression is provided. If that doesn't pan out, I can explore wave functions or integration.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Initial and Final Energy Levels**\n\nLet's proceed with the idea of comparing energy levels.\n\n- **Initial Width:** \\(L_i = a\\)\n- **Final Width:** \\(L_f = 4a\\)\n\nThe energy levels for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite well are given by:\n\n\\[\nE_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(n\\) is the quantum number (1, 2, 3, ...)\n- \\(L\\) is the width of the well\n\n- **Initial Energy Level (\\(E_{n_i}\\)):**\n  \\[\n  E_{n_i} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2ma^2} = E \\quad (\\text{given})\n  \\]\n\n- **Final Energy Level (\\(E_{n_f}\\)):**\n  \\[\n  E_{n_f} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m(4a)^2} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{32ma^2} = \\frac{1}{16}E\n  \\]\n\nSo, the final energy level is \\(\\frac{1}{16}E\\).\n\n### **Quick Check: Does This Make Sense?**\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait a second, reducing the width of the well by a factor of 4 would increase the energy levels, not decrease them.\n- **Realization:** I made an error in my calculation. Let's correct it.\n\n### **Correction: Calculating Final Energy Level Again**\n\nI realized that I need to re-evaluate the final energy level, considering the width increases to \\(4a\\).\n\n- **Correct Final Energy Level (\\(E_{n_f}\\)):**\n  \\[\n  E_{n_f} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m(4a)^2} = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{32ma^2} = \\frac{1}{16}E\n  \\]\n\nWait, this still seems off. Reducing the well's width should increase the energy, not decrease it. Let me double-check my approach.\n\n### **Re-evaluating the Strategy**\n\nHmm, I think I initially misunderstood the problem. The walls are being moved from \\(a\\) to \\(4a\\), which means the width is increasing, not decreasing. So, the energy should indeed decrease.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Difference in Energy Levels**\n\nNow, let's find the work done by calculating the change in energy.\n\n- **Initial Energy:** \\(E\\)\n- **Final Energy:** \\(\\frac{1}{16}E\\)\n\n- **Change in Energy (\\(\\Delta E\\)):**\n  \\[\n  \\Delta E = E_{n_f} - E_{n_i} = \\frac{1}{16}E - E = -\\frac{15}{16}E\n  \\]\n\n### **Check: Does the Negative Sign Make Sense?**\n\n- **Reflection:** The negative sign indicates that work is done **on** the system, which aligns with the walls being moved outward, increasing the well's width.\n- **Conclusion:** This seems reasonable. The particle's energy decreases as the well expands.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n- **Verification:** To ensure correctness, let's think about the physical process. Moving the walls outward should reduce the confinement of the particle, leading to lower energy levels. The negative work done aligns with this expectation.\n- **Random Insight:** Additionally, the calculated change in energy (\\(-\\frac{15}{16}E\\)) closely matches one of the provided options, which adds confidence to the solution.\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\nAfter comparing initial and final energy levels and considering the physical implications of moving the walls outward, we've determined that the work done in this process is:\n\n\\[\nW = -\\frac{15}{16}E\n\\]\n\n**Correct Answer:** **(A) - (15/16)E**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Calculation Consistency:** The steps are consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics regarding infinite wells.\n- **Option Matching:** The calculated work matches option (A), aligning with our expectations.\n\nOverall, this approach\u2014calculating the difference in energy levels\u2014effectively determines the work done during the wall's movement.\n\n**Reflection:** Initially, there was some confusion about the direction of the energy change, but upon re-evaluating and verifying each step, the correct solution emerged. It's essential to remain flexible and willing to correct mistakes, as this leads to a more accurate and reliable outcome.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Brainstorming:** Started with considering energy levels and possible strategies.\n2. **Initial Attempt:** Calculated energy levels but realized a misunderstanding regarding the wall's movement direction.\n3. **Reflection and Correction:** Corrected the approach by reevaluating the final energy level.\n4. **Energy Difference Calculation:** Successfully computed the change in energy, leading to the work done.\n5. **Verification:** Confirmed that the negative sign and magnitude align with physical expectations.\n6. **Final Check:** Ensured the solution matched one of the provided options, affirming its correctness.",
