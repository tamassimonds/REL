I'll mimic human thought processes, including exploring different strategies, making mistakes, and checking my work to stay on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so the problem involves the parallax of a star being measured at 2 milliarcseconds. We're asked how the brightness (or flux) of this star changes if we place it at a distance of 20 parsecs.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Parallax:** I remember from astronomy that parallax is the apparent shift in position of a nearby star against distant background stars when viewed from different positions in Earth's orbit. It's typically measured in arcseconds.\n  \n- **Brightness/Flux:** Stellar brightness decreases with distance due to the inverse square law of light.\n\n- **Parsecs:** This is a unit of distance used in astronomy. One parsec is equivalent to about 3.26 light-years.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- **Approach 1:** Use the parallax information to determine the star\u2019s distance and apply the inverse square law to find the change in brightness.\n\n- **Approach 2:** Convert the parallax angle directly into distance in parsecs and then compare the brightness at the new distance.\n\n**Wait a minute:** I realize that since the question already provides the distance in parsecs (20 parsecs), we might not need to convert parallax to distance again.\n\n**Reconsidering:** Perhaps we should focus on how the parallax measurement relates to the distance and then use that to determine the brightness change when the star is placed at 20 parsecs.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Relating Parallax to Distance**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFrom previous knowledge, I recall the formula that relates parallax angle (in arcseconds) to distance (in parsecs):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance (parsecs)} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Parallax (arcseconds)}}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nGiven:\n- Parallax = 2 milliarcseconds = \\(2 \\times 10^{-3}\\) arcseconds\n\nApplying the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^{-3}} = 500 \\text{ parsecs}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because a parallax of 1 arcsecond corresponds to a distance of 1 parsec. Therefore, 2 milliarcseconds should correspond to 500 parsecs.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Comparing Distances to Determine Brightness Change**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, we know the star is originally at 500 parsecs, and we want to see how its brightness changes when placed at 20 parsecs. This involves comparing the brightness at these two distances using the inverse square law.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- **Approach 1:** Calculate the brightness ratio directly using the inverse square of distances.\n  \n- **Approach 2:** Since 500 parsecs and 20 parsecs are both given, set up the ratio without additional conversions.\n\n**Decision:** Approach 2 seems more straightforward since both distances are already in parsecs.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nUsing the inverse square law:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Brightness at 20 parsecs}}{\\text{Brightness at 500 parsecs}} = \\left(\\frac{500}{20}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\left(25\\right)^2 = 625\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, the options are ~620, ~410, ~530, ~170. Our calculated factor is 625, which is very close to 620. Maybe the slight difference is due to rounding or approximation in the options provided.\n\n**Conclusion at This Point:** The brightness increases by a factor of approximately 625 when the star is moved from 500 parsecs to 20 parsecs.\n\n**Answer Choice:** **(A) ~620**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- **Does the inverse square law apply here?** Yes, because we're dealing with point sources of light (stars) and comparing brightness at different distances.\n\n- **Is the parallax calculation correct?** Yes, converting milliarcseconds to arcseconds and applying the parallax-distance formula gives a sensible distance.\n\n- **Does the brightness factor align with the options?** Yes, 625 is approximately 620, which matches option (A).\n\n**Wait, let's double-check:** \n\n- **Alternative Method:** Could we use another approach, such as leveraging the definition of parallax directly with the given distance?\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nGiven that parallax (p) in arcseconds is the apparent shift over 1 year at a distance of 1 parsec, we can relate it directly to the new distance.\n\nBut since we've already connected parallax to distance and applied the inverse square law correctly, this alternative path would likely lead to the same calculation.\n\n**Final Reflection:** The original approach is correct, and the answer aligns well with the provided options.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully considering different strategies, performing calculations, and verifying each step, the factor by which the brightness of the star changes when placed at a distance of 20 parsecs is approximately **620**.\n\n**Final Answer:** **(A) ~620**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstormed** different methods to relate parallax and brightness change.\n- **Calculated** the distance using the parallax formula.\n- **Applied** the inverse square law to determine the brightness factor.\n- **Verified** the approach by checking against provided options and considering alternative methods.\n- **Concluded** with the final answer, ensuring alignment with the closest option.\n\nThroughout this process, I reflected often, checked for consistency, and adjusted strategies as needed, mimicking a human problem-solving approach.",

Since the star is the same, M is the same in both cases.\nSo: m2-m1=5log(d2/d1)=-6.99\nAnd ratio of the fluxes is given by: m2-m1=-2.5log(F2/F1)\nSo: F2/F1=10^2.792~620"
