    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and walk through it step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check if everything makes sense, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, I see that Ben's height off the ground at time \\( t \\) is given by the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ \nh(t) = 2t^2 - 5t + 29 \n\\]\n\nThe question asks for his **minimum height** to the nearest foot.\n\nInitial Brainstorming:\n\n1. **Quadratic Function:** This reminds me of finding the vertex of a parabola since the height equation is a quadratic function. I know that the vertex of a parabola gives its maximum or minimum point, depending on the direction it opens.\n\n2. **Completing the Square:** Perhaps I could complete the square to rewrite the equation in vertex form, which might make it easier to identify the minimum height.\n\n3. **Using Calculus:** Another approach could be to use calculus, specifically finding the derivative and setting it to zero to find the minimum point.\n\n4. **Graphing:** Finally, graphing the function could provide a visual aid to confirm the minimum height.\n\nHmm, at first glance, completing the square or using calculus seems like the most straightforward methods for finding the minimum of a quadratic function. But let me consider each approach briefly:\n\n- **Completing the Square:** This is often taught as a standard method for finding the vertex of a parabola. It feels intuitive since I can directly rewrite the equation to identify the minimum value.\n\n- **Calculus:** Using derivatives is a powerful tool, but it requires more steps and might be overkill for a simple quadratic.\n\n- **Graphing:** This would visually confirm the minimum but doesn't give an exact numerical answer unless done carefully.\n\nGiven these options, I think **completing the square** might be the most direct and straightforward method. But let me proceed with this approach and see if it works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Completing the Square**\n\nLet's try completing the square to find the vertex of the quadratic equation.\n\n**Original Equation:**\n\n\\[ \nh(t) = 2t^2 - 5t + 29 \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait, before I start, I need to make sure the coefficient of \\( t^2 \\) is 1. Let me factor out the leading coefficient from the \\( t^2 \\) and \\( t \\) terms.\n\n**Factoring Out the Leading Coefficient:**\n\n\\[ \nh(t) = 2(t^2 - \\frac{5}{2}t) + 29 \n\\]\n\nHmm, that looks better. Now, I can complete the square inside the parentheses.\n\n**Finding the Square to Complete:**\n\nI need to add and subtract a specific value inside the parentheses to make it a perfect square trinomial. The value is \\(\\left(\\frac{\\text{coefficient of } t}{2}\\right)^2\\).\n\nLet's calculate it:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient of } t = -\\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{-\\frac{5}{2}}{2} = -\\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Adding and Subtracting Inside the Parentheses:**\n\nBut wait, since I factored out a 2, adding \\(\\frac{25}{16}\\) inside the parentheses actually adds \\(2 \\times \\frac{25}{16} = \\frac{25}{8}\\) to the equation. So, I need to subtract that extra amount outside.\n\n**Rewriting the Equation:**\n\n\\[\nh(t) = 2\\left(t^2 - \\frac{5}{2}t + \\frac{25}{16} - \\frac{25}{16}\\right) + 29\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2\\left(\\left(t - \\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2 - \\frac{25}{16}\\right) + 29\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2\\left(t - \\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2 - 2 \\times \\frac{25}{16} + 29\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2\\left(t - \\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2 - \\frac{25}{8} + 29\n\\]\n\n**Converting 29 to Eighths for Easiness:**\n\n\\[\n29 = \\frac{232}{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nh(t) = 2\\left(t - \\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{232}{8} - \\frac{25}{8}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2\\left(t - \\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2 + \\frac{207}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so now the equation is in vertex form:\n\n\\[\nh(t) = 2\\left(t - \\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2 + \\frac{207}{8}\n\\]\n\nI can see that the minimum height occurs at \\( t = \\frac{5}{4} \\), and the minimum height is \\( \\frac{207}{8} \\) feet.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet me quickly check if this makes sense. The vertex form of a parabola opens upwards (since the coefficient of the square term is positive), so the vertex should indeed be the minimum point.\n\n**Calculation Check:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{207}{8} = 25.875\n\\]\nSo, to the nearest foot, the minimum height is approximately 26 feet.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the time \\( t = \\frac{5}{4} \\) to ensure it's within a reasonable range. Since the problem doesn't specify a maximum time, I assume \\( t \\) can be any positive real number.\n\nHmm, \\( t = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \\) seconds seems reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 1:**\n\nCompleting the square worked well here. I've identified the minimum height as 26 feet to the nearest foot.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with Another Method \u2013 Using Calculus**\n\nJust to be sure, let's verify this result using calculus by finding the derivative and setting it to zero to find the critical points.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait a minute, although completing the square gave me a clear answer, using calculus can confirm that \\( t = \\frac{5}{4} \\) is indeed the minimum point.\n\n**Calculating the Derivative:**\n\n\\[\nh(t) = 2t^2 - 5t + 29\n\\]\n\\[\nh'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(2t^2) - \\frac{d}{dt}(5t) + \\frac{d}{dt}(29) = 4t - 5\n\\]\n\n**Setting the Derivative to Zero to Find Critical Points:**\n\n\\[\n4t - 5 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n4t = 5\n\\]\n\\[\nt = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the Minimum Height:**\n\nNow, substitute \\( t = \\frac{5}{4} \\) back into the original height equation to find the minimum height.\n\n\\[\nh\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2 - 5\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right) + 29\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2 \\times \\frac{25}{16} - \\frac{25}{4} + 29\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{50}{16} - \\frac{100}{16} + 29\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{50 - 100}{16} + 29\n\\]\n\\[\n= -\\frac{50}{16} + 29\n\\]\n\\[\n= -\\frac{25}{8} + 29\n\\]\n\\[\n= -3.125 + 29\n\\]\n\\[\n= 25.875\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, the height is still \\( 25.875 \\) feet, which rounds to 26 feet. This confirms that our previous method was correct.\n\n**Calculation Check:**\n\nLet me double-check the arithmetic:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{16} = 3.125\n\\]\n\\[\n-\\frac{100}{16} = -6.25\n\\]\n\\[\n3.125 - 6.25 = -3.125\n\\]\n\\[\n-3.125 + 29 = 25.875\n\\]\nYes, the calculations are correct.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 2:**\n\nUsing calculus also confirms that the minimum height is 26 feet to the nearest foot. This reassures me that the completing the square method was valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring two different strategies\u2014completing the square and using calculus\u2014I've consistently arrived at the minimum height of **26 feet**. Both methods showed that the minimum occurs at \\( t = \\frac{5}{4} \\) seconds.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Completing the Square:** This method provided a straightforward way to identify the vertex of the parabola, directly giving the minimum height.\n\n- **Calculus Verification:** Taking the derivative confirmed the critical point identified by completing the square, ensuring the solution's accuracy.\n\n- **Multiple Approaches:** Thinking through different strategies helped verify the correctness and deepen my understanding of the problem.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nTo the nearest foot, Ben's minimum height while climbing the tree will be **26 feet**.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step walkthrough, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and verification, captures the human-like thought process in tackling this problem.
