    "working_out": "**First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We're dealing with a 30-60-90 right triangle, and we're given the length of the hypotenuse as \\(2\\sqrt{6}\\) centimeters. The task is to find the sum of the lengths of the two legs.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Properties of a 30-60-90 Triangle:**  \n   I remember that in a 30-60-90 triangle, there are specific ratios between the sides. The shortest leg is opposite the 30-degree angle, the longer leg is opposite the 60-degree angle, and the hypotenuse is the longest side.\n\n2. **Ratios Approach:**  \n   Since I know the side lengths have fixed ratios, I can possibly set up a relationship between them using these ratios.\n\n3. **Pythagorean Theorem:**  \n   Normally, I\u2019d think to apply the Pythagorean theorem, but wait\u2014since it's a 30-60-90 triangle, I might not need it because the side ratios already give me the lengths.\n\n**Let\u2019s Start with the Ratios Approach**\n\n**Step 1: Recall the Side Ratios**\n\nFor a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio:\n- \\(1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2\\)  \n  - The side opposite the 30-degree angle is the shortest: \\(x\\)  \n  - The side opposite the 60-degree angle is longer: \\(x\\sqrt{3}\\)  \n  - The hypotenuse is the longest: \\(2x\\)  \n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis makes sense because the hypotenuse is always twice the length of the shortest side in these types of triangles.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Given Hypotenuse to the Ratio**\n\nWe know the hypotenuse is \\(2x\\), and according to the problem, it's \\(2\\sqrt{6}\\) cm.  \nSo,  \n\\[ \n2x = 2\\sqrt{6} \n\\]  \n**Simplify to Find \\(x\\):**  \n\\[ \nx = \\sqrt{6} \n\\]  \n\n**Check:**  \nWait, let me check if this makes sense. If the hypotenuse is \\(2\\sqrt{6}\\), then half of that should be \\(\\sqrt{6}\\), which is what I just found for \\(x\\). That seems correct.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Lengths of the Legs Using \\(x\\)**\n\n- **Shortest Leg (Opposite 30\u00b0):**  \n  \\[ \n  \\text{Leg}_1 = x = \\sqrt{6} \\text{ cm} \n  \\]\n\n- **Longer Leg (Opposite 60\u00b0):**  \n  \\[ \n  \\text{Leg}_2 = x\\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{6}\\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{18} \\text{ cm} \n  \\]  \n  \\[ \n  \\sqrt{18} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 2} = 3\\sqrt{2} \\text{ cm} \n  \\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so the shorter leg is \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) cm, and the longer leg is \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\) cm. That aligns with the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle. Let me double-check the calculations:\n\n- \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) is definitely the shorter leg.\n- \\(x\\sqrt{3}\\) should give me \\(\\sqrt{6}\\times\\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\), which checks out.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Sum of the Legs**\n\nNow, adding up the lengths of the two legs:  \n\\[ \n\\text{Sum} = \\sqrt{6} + 3\\sqrt{2} \n\\]  \n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis is a messy-looking sum, but it's common in such problems. I could approximate the numerical value if needed, but usually, leaving it in terms of square roots is acceptable unless a decimal answer is specifically requested.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nLet\u2019s see if adding \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) and \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\) makes sense. Both are irrational numbers, and they\u2019re added together correctly. No issues there.\n\n**Exploring Another Approach: Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Wait, perhaps I should verify using the Pythagorean theorem to ensure everything aligns.**  \n\nThough I initially thought it might not be necessary, let's see if it provides a consistent check.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nFor any right triangle:  \n\\[ \na^2 + b^2 = c^2 \n\\]  \nWhere:\n- \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse\n- \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the legs\n\n**Given:**\n- Hypotenuse \\(c = 2\\sqrt{6} = 4.899\\) (approx)\n- Legs \\(a = \\sqrt{6} \\approx 2.449\\) and \\(b = 3\\sqrt{2} \\approx 4.243\\)\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ \n(\\sqrt{6})^2 + (3\\sqrt{2})^2 = (2\\sqrt{6})^2 \n\\]  \n\\[ \n6 + 18 = 24 \n\\]  \n\\[ \n4.899^2 \\approx 24  (\\text{since } 4.899 \\times 4.899 \\approx 24) \n\\]  \n\n**Check:**  \nWait, so \\(6 + 18 = 24\\) and \\(24 = 24\\)? That matches up. But I notice the decimal approximation \\(4.899\\) is very close to \\(4.899\\), which is \\(2\\sqrt{6}\\). So, even though the decimals aren't exact due to rounding, the squared values align perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth methods\u2014using the ratios specific to a 30-60-90 triangle and verifying with the Pythagorean theorem\u2014lead to consistent and correct results.\n\n**Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n\nYes, the sum of the lengths of the two legs is \\(\\sqrt{6} + 3\\sqrt{2}\\) cm. This aligns with the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle. The calculations check out, and the Pythagorean theorem confirms the relationship between the sides.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{6} + 3\\sqrt{2}} \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Started with Understanding:** Initially focused on recalling the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle to use the side ratios effectively.\n  \n- **Checked Along the Way:** After calculating each leg, verified with the Pythagorean theorem for consistency.\n\n- **Reflected and Corrected:** Although the Pythagorean theorem wasn't necessary, applying it provided an additional layer of verification.\n\n- **Concluded Confidently:** The sum of the legs is correctly calculated, and multiple methods confirm its accuracy.\n\nThis approach ensured a thorough and accurate solution, incorporating multiple strategies and checks to arrive confidently at the final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "We know that the ratio of the lengths of the sides of a 30-60-90 triangle is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$. We know that the length of the hypotenuse is $2\\sqrt{6}$ and the ratio of the length shortest leg to that of the hypotenuse is $1:2$. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg is $\\sqrt{6}$. Since the ratio of the shorter leg to the longer leg is $1:\\sqrt{3}$, the length of the longer leg is $\\sqrt{6} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 3\\sqrt{2}$. The sum of the lengths of these two legs is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{6} + 3\\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters."
