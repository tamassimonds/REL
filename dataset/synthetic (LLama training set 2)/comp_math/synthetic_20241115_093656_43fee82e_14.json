    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming and exploring different strategies to see how I can approach it. I\u2019ll reflect often, check my work, and change direction if needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving this on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question is about finding \\( r^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 \\), where \\( r \\), \\( s \\), and \\( t \\) are the roots of the cubic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 20x^2 + 18x - 7 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Familiar Territory:** This looks similar to problems involving symmetric sums of roots. I remember that for cubic equations, we can relate the roots to the coefficients using Vieta's formulas.\n- **Thinking About Vieta's:** I know Vieta's formulas relate the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. Maybe I can use those.\n- **Alternative Approaches:** Another method could be to compute the roots directly, but that seems tedious and unnecessary. Perhaps leveraging symmetrical properties of the roots would be more efficient.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Use Vieta\u2019s Formulas:** This seems like the most straightforward approach. I can express \\( r^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 \\) in terms of the elementary symmetric sums.\n- **Exploring Symmetric Sums:** Perhaps I can factor or manipulate the expression to simplify it using known identities.\n- **Direct Computation:** If all else fails, compute the roots numerically and then calculate the required sum, but I\u2019d prefer to avoid this if possible.\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Vieta's Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since Vieta's formulas relate the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients, maybe I can express \\( r^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 \\) in terms of the symmetric sums \\( r+s+t \\), \\( rs+rt+ts \\), and \\( rst \\).\n- I recall that symmetric sums can be quite handy in such problems.\n\n**Vieta's Formulas for a Cubic Equation:**\n- \\( r + s + t = 20 \\) (sum of roots)\n- \\( rs + rt + st = 18 \\) (sum of products of roots taken two at a time)\n- \\( rst = 7 \\) (product of roots)\n\n**Realization:**\n- Wait, to directly use these in \\( r^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 \\), I might need to manipulate the expression a bit.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Let me see if there's a relationship I can establish using these sums.\n\n### **Step 2: Manipulating the Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The expression \\( r^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 \\) looks like it involves the squares of the products of the roots.\n- Maybe I can factor or expand it using the symmetric sums I have from Vieta\u2019s.\n\n**Attempt to Factor:**\n- Notice that \\( r^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 \\) can be written as \\( (rs)^2 + (st)^2 + (tr)^2 \\).\n- This resembles the sum of squares, which can sometimes be related to the square of the sum of products.\n\n**Idea:**\n- Perhaps I can express \\( (rs + st + rt)^2 \\) and subtract the necessary terms to isolate \\( r^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n(rs + rt + st)^2 = r^2s^2 + r^2t^2 + s^2t^2 + 2rsrt + 2rsst + 2rtrt\n\\]\n\\[\n= (rs)^2 + (st)^2 + (tr)^2 + 2(rsrt + rsst + rtrt)\n\\]\n\n**Wait, This Seems Complicated:**\n- Hmm, this approach is getting messy. Maybe there\u2019s a simpler way to relate \\( r^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 \\) to the symmetric sums.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**\n- Let\u2019s think differently. Perhaps I can use the identity:\n\\[\nr^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 = (rs + rt + st)^2 - 2rst(r + s + t)\n\\]\n- This seems more straightforward because it directly relates the desired sum to known symmetric sums.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Alternative Identity**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I\u2019ll use the identity:\n\\[\nr^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 = (rs + rt + st)^2 - 2rst(r + s + t)\n\\]\n- This should simplify things by plugging in the values from Vieta\u2019s formulas.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Calculate \\( (rs + rt + st)^2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   rs + rt + st = 18 \\implies (rs + rt + st)^2 = 18^2 = 324\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 2rst(r + s + t) \\):**\n   \\[\n   rst = 7 \\text{ and } r + s + t = 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 7 \\times 20 = 280\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the Results:**\n   \\[\n   r^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 = 324 - 280 = 44\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- That seems right, but let's double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- \\( (rs + rt + st)^2 = 324 \\)\n- \\( 2rst(r + s + t) = 280 \\)\n- \\( 324 - 280 = 44 \\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The calculations check out. The value of \\( r^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 \\) is indeed **44**.\n\n### **Step 4: Verification and Final Thoughts**\n\n**Verification:**\n- The identity used is correct and aligns with the properties of symmetric sums.\n- The calculations are straightforward, and the numbers make sense.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- Initially, I considered starting with Vieta\u2019s formulas and attempting to relate everything directly. However, recognizing the identity relating \\( r^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 \\) to \\( (rs + rt + st)^2 \\) simplified the process significantly.\n- It\u2019s always good to look for known identities or relationships that can streamline calculations, especially when dealing with symmetric sums.\n- The answer logically follows, and all steps align with the mathematical principles involved.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\nr^2s^2 + s^2t^2 + t^2r^2 = \\boxed{44}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration mirrors a natural human thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and verification.

  "ground_truth": "By Vieta's formulas, $rs + st + tr = 18.$ Squaring this equation gives us the terms we want: \\[(rs+st+tr)^2 = (rs)^2 + (st)^2 + (tr)^2 + (2r^2st + 2rs^2t + 2rst^2) = 324.\\]To deal with the extra terms, we note that \\[r^2st + rs^2t + rst^2 = rst(r+s+t) = 7 \\cdot 20 = 140,\\]again by Vieta. Therefore, \\[(rs)^2 + (st)^2 + (tr)^2 = 324 - 2\\cdot 140 = \\boxed{44}.\\]"
