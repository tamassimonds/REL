    "working_out": "Sure! Let's dive into solving this problem step by step, simulating a natural human thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's begin by thoroughly understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, I see the problem involves fractions and ratios between variables \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), and \\(w\\). Specifically, we're given:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{4}{5}, \\quad \\frac{y}{z} = \\frac{3}{10}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{z}{w} = \\frac{6}{7}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the value of:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{x + y + w}{z}\n\\]\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Maybe I can express all variables in terms of a single variable. That way, I can substitute and simplify.\n  \n- **Strategy 2:** Another approach could be to find the relationships between the variables step by step and see if they cancel out nicely.\n\n- **Strategy 3:** I could also consider multiplying the given ratios to see if the intermediate variables cancel out.\n\nHmm, looking at the relationships, expressing everything in terms of one variable seems straightforward. But let me start with Strategy 1 and see how it goes. If it gets messy, I'll reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expressing Variables in Terms of One Another**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI\u2019ll start by expressing \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(w\\) in terms of \\(z\\). This way, I can replace \\(x\\) and \\(w\\) in the expression \\(\\frac{x + y + w}{z}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **From \\(\\frac{y}{z} = \\frac{3}{10}\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   y = z \\times \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{3z}{10}\n   \\]\n\n2. **From \\(\\frac{z}{w} = \\frac{6}{7}\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   w = z \\times \\frac{7}{6} = \\frac{7z}{6}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Now, substitute \\(y\\) into \\(\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{4}{5}\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{\\frac{3z}{10}} = \\frac{4}{5}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n\n   \\[\n   x \\times \\frac{10}{3z} = \\frac{4}{5} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = z \\times \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{12z}{50} = \\frac{6z}{25}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so now I have all variables in terms of \\(z\\):\n\n- \\(x = \\frac{6z}{25}\\)\n- \\(y = \\frac{3z}{10}\\)\n- \\(w = \\frac{7z}{6}\\)\n\nThis seems like a good start. Let me check if these make sense:\n\n- \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are fractions of \\(z\\), which aligns with the given ratios.\n- \\(w\\) is also expressed in terms of \\(z\\).\n\nEverything checks out so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting into the Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll substitute \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(w\\) back into the expression \\(\\frac{x + y + w}{z}\\) and simplify.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nx + y + w = \\frac{6z}{25} + \\frac{3z}{10} + \\frac{7z}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Finding a Common Denominator:**\n\nHmm, I need to add these fractions. Let me find a common denominator.\n\n- The denominators are 25, 10, and 6.\n- The least common multiple (LCM) of 25, 10, and 6 is 150.\n\n**Converting Fractions:**\n\nLet\u2019s convert each fraction to have a denominator of 150:\n\n1. **For \\(\\frac{6z}{25}\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6z}{25} \\times \\frac{6}{6} = \\frac{36z}{150}\n   \\]\n\n2. **For \\(\\frac{3z}{10}\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3z}{10} \\times \\frac{15}{15} = \\frac{45z}{150}\n   \\]\n\n3. **For \\(\\frac{7z}{6}\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7z}{6} \\times \\frac{25}{25} = \\frac{175z}{150}\n   \\]\n\n**Adding the Fractions:**\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n\\[\nx + y + w = \\frac{36z}{150} + \\frac{45z}{150} + \\frac{175z}{150} = \\frac{256z}{150}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\nx + y + w = \\frac{256z}{150} = \\frac{128z}{75}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, let me quickly check the simplification:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{256}{150} = \\frac{128}{75} \\quad \\text{(divided numerator and denominator by 2)}\n\\]\n\nThat looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Dividing by \\(z\\) to Find the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, we need to find \\(\\frac{x + y + w}{z}\\), so I\u2019ll divide the simplified expression by \\(z\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x + y + w}{z} = \\frac{\\frac{128z}{75}}{z} = \\frac{128z}{75z}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x + y + w}{z} = \\frac{128}{75}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks straightforward. By canceling out \\(z\\) in the numerator and denominator, I get \\(\\frac{128}{75}\\). Let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\n- **Check:** Does removing \\(z\\) align with the original question? Yes, because we\u2019re asked for the sum of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(w\\) divided by \\(z\\).\n\nEverything seems logical, and the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{x + y + w}{z} = \\frac{128}{75}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy expressing all variables in terms of \\(z\\) and finding a common denominator to add the fractions, I arrived at \\(\\frac{128}{75}\\). Throughout the process, I checked each step to ensure the calculations were correct and adjusted my approach when necessary. This approach streamlined the problem, making it easier to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThinking through different strategies helped me confirm that expressing variables in terms of a single one was the most efficient method. Regular checks maintained the correctness of each step, preventing simple mistakes from propagating. Overall, this step-by-step approach ensured a clear and accurate solution.",
