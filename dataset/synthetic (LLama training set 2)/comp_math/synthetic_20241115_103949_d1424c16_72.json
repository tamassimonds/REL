I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on them, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's begin by thoroughly understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I see the question \"What is the sum of all numbers \\( a \\) for which the graph of \\( y = x^2 + a \\) and the graph of \\( y = ax \\) intersect one time?\", I think:\n\n- **Graphs Involved:** We're dealing with a quadratic function \\( y = x^2 + a \\) and a linear function \\( y = ax \\). \n- **Intersection Points:** The problem is asking for values of \\( a \\) where these two graphs intersect exactly once.\n- **Sum of \\( a \\):** Once we find all such \\( a \\), we need to sum them up.\n\n**Additional Thoughts:**\n\n- This reminds me of problems where you set two equations equal to find their intersection points.\n- I **think** that solving for \\( x \\) when \\( x^2 + a = ax \\) will help identify the conditions for a single intersection.\n- But then, I wonder, what does it mean for the graphs to intersect exactly once? Is there a specific relationship between \\( a \\) and the coefficients that ensures this?\n\n**Possible Reflection:**\n\n- At first, I **considered** just solving the equation \\( x^2 + a = ax \\) directly, but then I **realized** that might lead to a quadratic equation in \\( x \\), which could have multiple solutions depending on \\( a \\).\n- Maybe there's a condition on \\( a \\) that makes the quadratic equation have only one solution (a repeated root).\n- Wait, that suggests using the discriminant of the quadratic equation to find when there\u2019s only one solution.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Set Equations Equal:** Solve \\( x^2 + a = ax \\) to find intersection points.\n2. **Use the Quadratic Formula:** Apply the quadratic formula to see under what conditions there\u2019s only one solution.\n3. **Analyze the Discriminant:** Determine how the discriminant relates to having a single solution.\n4. **Check Symmetry:** Maybe the graphs have a symmetrical property that facilitates finding \\( a \\).\n\nWhich strategy should I start with? I think starting by setting the equations equal is foundational. If that leads to a quadratic equation, then applying the quadratic formula and analyzing the discriminant makes sense.\n\n**Let\u2019s Proceed:**\n\nI'll begin by setting the two equations equal to each other to find the points of intersection.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting the Equations Equal**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the intersection points, I need to solve:\n\n\\[ \nx^2 + a = ax \n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubtract \\( ax \\) from both sides to rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[ \nx^2 - ax + a = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, now I have a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x \\). This makes sense because the intersection points correspond to the values of \\( x \\) where both graphs are equal. \n\nBut, I notice that the equation depends on \\( a \\). Specifically, the coefficients of \\( x \\) and the constant term involve \\( a \\). This suggests that the value of \\( a \\) influences the number of intersection points.\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs this correct so far? Yes, setting the graphs equal gives a quadratic equation, which is a standard approach for finding intersection points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to determine under what conditions this quadratic equation \\( x^2 - ax + a = 0 \\) has exactly one solution for \\( x \\). \n\nFrom my previous reflection, I recalled that a quadratic equation has a single solution (a repeated root) when its discriminant is zero.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nRecall the standard form of a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ \nAx^2 + Bx + C = 0 \n\\]\n\nIn our case:\n\n- \\( A = 1 \\)\n- \\( B = -a \\)\n- \\( C = a \\)\n\nThe discriminant \\( \\Delta \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \n\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC \n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \n\\Delta = (-a)^2 - 4(1)(a) = a^2 - 4a \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute, the discriminant is \\( a^2 - 4a \\). For the quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, this discriminant must be zero:\n\n\\[ \na^2 - 4a = 0 \n\\]\n\nThis equation will give us the values of \\( a \\) where the graphs intersect at exactly one point.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because when the discriminant is zero, the quadratic equation has a repeated root, meaning the graphs touch at exactly one point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving for \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to solve the equation \\( a^2 - 4a = 0 \\) to find the values of \\( a \\) that satisfy this condition.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's factor the equation:\n\n\\[ \na^2 - 4a = 0 \n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ \na(a - 4) = 0 \n\\]\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives:\n\n\\[ \na = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a = 4 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the possible values of \\( a \\) are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 4 \\). \n\nBut wait, I should double-check to ensure these values indeed lead to exactly one intersection point between the graphs.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet's quickly verify:\n\n- **For \\( a = 0 \\):**\n  - The equations become \\( y = x^2 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\).\n  - Setting \\( x^2 = 0 \\) gives \\( x = 0 \\). So, there's exactly one intersection at \\( (0, 0) \\).\n\n- **For \\( a = 4 \\):**\n  - The equations become \\( y = x^2 + 4 \\) and \\( y = 4x \\).\n  - Setting \\( x^2 + 4 = 4x \\) leads to \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( (x - 2)^2 = 0 \\). So, there\u2019s exactly one intersection at \\( (2, 8) \\).\n\nBoth cases confirm that \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( a = 4 \\) result in exactly one intersection point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Summing the Values of \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of all such \\( a \\). Since we've identified that \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( a = 4 \\) are the only values where the graphs intersect at exactly one point, I just need to add these together.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[ \n0 + 4 = 4 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the sum of all numbers \\( a \\) for which the graphs intersect at exactly one point is \\( 4 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes the sum make sense in the context of the problem? Yes, because we've thoroughly checked that both \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( a = 4 \\) lead to single intersection points.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nThroughout the process, I started by setting the graphs equal to find the intersection points, which led me to a quadratic equation dependent on \\( a \\). By analyzing the discriminant, I identified the condition for a single solution, solved for \\( a \\), and verified each case to ensure correctness.\n\nInitially, I considered directly solving the equation but realized that understanding the discriminant was key to finding the solution efficiently. Checking each step ensured that the approach was correct, and reflecting at each stage helped catch any potential errors early.\n\nIn the end, summing the valid \\( a \\) values gave the correct answer: **4**. This step-by-step exploration confirms the solution, making sure each part of the process is aligned with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n**Additional Note:**\n\nIf I hadn't thought about the discriminant initially, I might have ended up solving the quadratic equation completely, which isn't necessary for determining when there's a single intersection point. Reflecting and adjusting the strategy allowed me to streamline the solution effectively.",
