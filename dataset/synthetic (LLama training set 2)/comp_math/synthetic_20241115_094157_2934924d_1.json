    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through it like I naturally would.\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Okay, so Chris is labeling lattice points with the square of the distance to the origin.\n- A lattice point means both coordinates are integers.\n- We're looking for points where this squared distance equals \\(25\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- Squared distance sounds like the Pythagorean theorem: \\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\\).\n- So, I need to find all integer pairs \\((x, y)\\) that satisfy this equation.\n- This feels like finding integer solutions to a Diophantine equation.\n  \n**Exploring Strategies:**\n1. **List Possible Coordinates:** Maybe I can list out integer pairs and see which ones fit.\n2. **Use Symmetry:** Since distance is symmetric, perhaps I only need to find solutions in one quadrant and then mirror them.\n3. **Algebraic Approach:** Solve \\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\\) for integer values systematically.\n\n**Choosing a Strategy:**\n- **Symmetry Sounds Efficient:** Instead of checking every possible pair, leveraging symmetry might save time.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I know the squared distance is \\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\\).\n- \\(25\\) is a perfect square, so I'm looking for integers whose squares add up to \\(25\\).\n\n**Write it Down:**\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = 25 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- \\(25\\) is \\(5^2\\), so I'm essentially looking for integer points on a circle with radius 5.\n- This limits the values \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can take since their squares must add to \\(25\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Possible Values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- If \\(x^2\\) is less than or equal to \\(25\\), then \\(x\\) can be between \\(-5\\) and \\(5\\).\n- Similarly for \\(y\\).\n\n**Listing Possible \\(x\\):**\n\\[ x = -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\]\n\n**Checking \\(y\\) for Each \\(x\\):**\n- For each \\(x\\), calculate \\(y^2 = 25 - x^2\\).\n- Determine if \\(25 - x^2\\) is a perfect square.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This approach seems systematic. Let's proceed with it.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Corresponding \\(y\\) for Each \\(x\\)**\n\n**First Calculation:**\n- **For \\(x = 0\\):**\n  \\[\n  y^2 = 25 - 0^2 = 25 \\\\\n  y = \\pm 5\n  \\]\n  **Points:** \\((0, 5)\\) and \\((0, -5)\\)\n\n**Second Calculation:**\n- **For \\(x = 1\\):**\n  \\[\n  y^2 = 25 - 1^2 = 24 \\\\\n  y = \\pm \\sqrt{24} \\text{ (not an integer)}\n  \\]\n  **No valid points.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Only integer \\(y\\) values work, so \\(x = 1\\) doesn't give valid points.\n\n**Continue with Other \\(x\\):**\n\n- **For \\(x = 2\\):**\n  \\[\n  y^2 = 25 - 2^2 = 21 \\\\\n  y = \\pm \\sqrt{21} \\text{ (not an integer)}\n  \\]\n  **No valid points.**\n  \n- **For \\(x = 3\\):**\n  \\[\n  y^2 = 25 - 3^2 = 16 \\\\\n  y = \\pm 4\n  \\]\n  **Points:** \\((3, 4)\\) and \\((3, -4)\\), and by symmetry \\((-3, 4)\\) and \\((-3, -4)\\)\n\n- **For \\(x = 4\\):**\n  \\[\n  y^2 = 25 - 4^2 = 9 \\\\\n  y = \\pm 3\n  \\]\n  **Points:** \\((4, 3)\\) and \\((4, -3)\\), and by symmetry \\((-4, 3)\\) and \\((-4, -3)\\)\n\n- **For \\(x = 5\\):**\n  \\[\n  y^2 = 25 - 5^2 = 0 \\\\\n  y = 0\n  \\]\n  **Points:** \\((5, 0)\\) and \\((-5, 0)\\)\n\n**Checking Negative \\(x\\):**\n- Since the equation is symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), negative \\(x\\) values will mirror the positive ones already found.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I\u2019ve found all points by checking \\(x\\) from \\(-5\\) to \\(5\\).\n- Symmetry helps reduce the work since negative \\(x\\) values mirror positive ones.\n\n### **Step 4: Listing All Valid Points**\n\n**Enumerating Found Points:**\n1. \\((0, 5)\\)\n2. \\((0, -5)\\)\n3. \\((3, 4)\\)\n4. \\((3, -4)\\)\n5. \\((-3, 4)\\)\n6. \\((-3, -4)\\)\n7. \\((4, 3)\\)\n8. \\((4, -3)\\)\n9. \\((-4, 3)\\)\n10. \\((-4, -3)\\)\n11. \\((5, 0)\\)\n12. \\((-5, 0)\\)\n\n**Counting Them:**\n- Total of 12 distinct lattice points.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Each point is unique and satisfies \\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\\).\n- The solution list seems complete.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Double-Check:**\n- Ensure all listed points satisfy \\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\\).\n\n**Sample Verification:**\n- **Point \\((3, 4)\\):**\n  \\[\n  3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25\n  \\]\n  **Correct!**\n\n- **Point \\((-5, 0)\\):**\n  \\[\n  (-5)^2 + 0^2 = 25 + 0 = 25\n  \\]\n  **Correct!**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All points satisfy the equation.\n- The count of 12 is accurate.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**How Many Times Does Chris Label a Point with the Number \\(25\\)?**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]\n\nAlright, that wraps it up. By systematically checking each possible \\(x\\) value and leveraging symmetry, I found all integer lattice points where the square of the distance to the origin is \\(25\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Consider the point $(x,y)$. Then, he labels the point with the number $$(\\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2})^2 = x^2 + y^2,$$ so it follows that $x^2 + y^2 = 25$. From here, some casework needs to be done to find the number of pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy $x^2 + y^2 = 25$. We note that $x^2 = 25 - y^2 \\le 25 \\Longrightarrow |x| \\le 5$, and so $|x|$ can only be equal to $0,1,2,3,4,5$. Of these, only $0,3,4,5$ produce integer solutions for $|y|$.\n\nIf $|x| = 3$, then $|y| = 4$, and any of the four combinations $(3,4)(-3,4)(3,-4)(-3,-4)$ work. Similarly, if $|x| = 4, |y| = 3$, there are four feasible distinct combinations.\n\nIf $|x| = 0$, then $|y| = 5$, but then there is only one possible value for $x$, and so there are only two combinations that work: $(0,5)$ and $(0,-5)$. Similarly, if $|x| = 5, |y| = 0$, there are two feasible distinct combinations.\nIn total, there are $\\boxed{12}$ possible pairs of integer coordinates that are labeled with $25$."
