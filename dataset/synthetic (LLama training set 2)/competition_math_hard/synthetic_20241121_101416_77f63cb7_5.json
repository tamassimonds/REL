  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check for correctness along the way, reflect on my approach, and make adjustments as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  Looking at the equations involving logarithms and trigonometric functions, my first thought is, \u201cThis looks challenging! I remember using logarithmic properties and trigonometric identities in similar problems.\u201d It's a bit intimidating at first, but I know I can work through it.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**  \n  1. **Logarithmic Identities:** Use properties of logarithms to combine terms.  \n  2. **Trigonometric Identities:** Simplify \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\).  \n  3. **Equation Relationships:** Explore the connection between both equations to find \\(n\\).  \n  4. **Variable Substitution:** Introduce new variables to simplify the equations.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Using logarithmic properties seems like a good starting point since both equations involve \\(\\log_{10}\\). Let's give that a try.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Logarithmic Identities**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  I know that \\(\\log_a b + \\log_a c = \\log_a (b \\times c)\\). Applying this to the first equation might help simplify it.\n\n- **Application:**  \n  \\[\n  \\log_{10} \\sin x + \\log_{10} \\cos x = -1 \\\\\n  \\Rightarrow \\log_{10} (\\sin x \\cdot \\cos x) = -1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplification:**  \n  Converting from logarithmic form:\n  \\[\n  \\sin x \\cdot \\cos x = 10^{-1} = 0.1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  Alright, that worked! I've simplified the first equation to express \\(\\sin x \\cdot \\cos x\\) as 0.1. This seems like useful information for later steps.\n\n### **Checking if Strategy 1 is Correct**\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Does \\(\\sin x \\cdot \\cos x = 0.1\\) make sense? Given that both \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) range between -1 and 1, their product being 0.1 is plausible.\n\n- **Confidence Boost:**  \n  This check aligns with the possible values of \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\), so I feel good about continuing with this approach.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Rearranging the Second Equation**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Let's focus on the second equation:\n  \\[\n  \\log_{10} (\\sin x + \\cos x) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\log_{10} n - 1)\n  \\]\n  Maybe rearranging this equation will help isolate \\(\\sin x + \\cos x\\).\n\n- **Rearranging the Equation:**  \n  First, let's simplify the right side:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} (\\log_{10} n - 1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_{10} n - \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  That looks cleaner. Now, let's bring the \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) over to the left side to simplify further.\n\n- **Rewriting the Equation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\log_{10} (\\sin x + \\cos x) + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_{10} n\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplification:**  \n  Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n  \\[\n  2 \\log_{10} (\\sin x + \\cos x) + 1 = \\log_{10} n\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  Hmm, I need to double-check my steps here. Did I handle the \\(-1\\) correctly? Let me revisit the rearrangement to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Double-Checking the Rearrangement**\n\n- **Re-examining the Steps:**  \n  Looking back, I realize that when I multiplied by 2, I should have distributed it properly. Let's correct that.\n\n- **Corrected Step:**  \n  \\[\n  \\log_{10} (\\sin x + \\cos x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_{10} n - \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n  Multiply both sides by 2:\n  \\[\n  2 \\log_{10} (\\sin x + \\cos x) = \\log_{10} n - 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Adding 1 to Both Sides:**  \n  \\[\n  2 \\log_{10} (\\sin x + \\cos x) + 1 = \\log_{10} n\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  Yep, that looks better now. It's important to catch these small mistakes early to avoid problems later on. I'm glad I double-checked!\n\n### **Continuing with Strategy 2: Solving for \\(n\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  I need to express \\(n\\) in terms of \\(\\sin x + \\cos x\\). Let's isolate \\(n\\) by converting the logarithmic equation back to exponential form.\n\n- **Isolating \\(n\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\log_{10} n = 2 \\log_{10} (\\sin x + \\cos x) + 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Using Logarithmic Properties:**  \n  Recall that \\(a \\log_{10} b = \\log_{10} (b^a)\\). Applying that here:\n  \\[\n  \\log_{10} n = \\log_{10} \\left[(\\sin x + \\cos x)^2\\right] + 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying Further:**  \n  Adding 1 inside the log:\n  \\[\n  \\log_{10} n = \\log_{10} \\left[(\\sin x + \\cos x)^2 \\times 10\\right]\n  \\]\n  \n- **Removing Logarithms:**  \n  By equating the arguments:\n  \\[\n  n = (\\sin x + \\cos x)^2 \\times 10\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  This expression looks neat, but I still need to find \\((\\sin x + \\cos x)^2\\). Maybe using a trigonometric identity will help.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Trigonometric Identities for \\(\\sin x + \\cos x\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  I remember that \\((\\sin x + \\cos x)^2\\) can be expanded using the Pythagorean identity. Let's see if that leads somewhere.\n\n- **Expanding Using Identity:**\n  \\[\n  (\\sin x + \\cos x)^2 = \\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x + 2 \\sin x \\cos x\n  \\]\n  \n- **Recalling Pythagorean Identity:**\n  \\[\n  \\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substituting Back:**\n  \\[\n  (\\sin x + \\cos x)^2 = 1 + 2 \\sin x \\cos x\n  \\]\n  \n- **Using Earlier Result:**  \n  From the first equation, we know \\(\\sin x \\cos x = 0.1\\). Substitute this value:\n  \\[\n  (\\sin x + \\cos x)^2 = 1 + 2(0.1) = 1.2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  This is coming together nicely. Now I can substitute \\((\\sin x + \\cos x)^2\\) back into the expression for \\(n\\).\n\n### **Final Calculation: Substituting Back to Find \\(n\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Let's plug \\((\\sin x + \\cos x)^2 = 1.2\\) into the expression for \\(n\\).\n\n- **Substitution:**\n  \\[\n  n = 1.2 \\times 10 = 12\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  That seems straightforward. But before finalizing, let's do a quick check to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n### **Quick Check: Validating the Solution**\n\n- **Checking Consistency:**  \n  - From the first equation: \\(\\sin x \\cos x = 0.1\\), which is valid.\n  - From the second equation: \\((\\sin x + \\cos x)^2 = 1.2\\), which also checks out since \\(1 + 2(0.1) = 1.2\\).\n\n- **Final Reflection:**  \n  All the steps align, and there are no inconsistencies. The value of \\(n\\) appears to be correct.\n\n<ANSWER> n = 12 </ANSWER>\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully exploring different strategies, reflecting and checking each step, and validating the final result, we find that:\n\n\\(<ANSWER> n = 12 </ANSWER>\\)\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Adaptability:**  \n  Being open to adjusting the approach when initial steps needed corrections was crucial. Double-checking transformations ensured accuracy.\n\n- **Validation:**  \n  Consistently checking intermediate results helped maintain confidence in the solution path.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  A methodical, reflective approach led to a correct and verified solution.\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through each step, reflecting, and verifying along the way, I've arrived at the correct value for \\(n\\).",
