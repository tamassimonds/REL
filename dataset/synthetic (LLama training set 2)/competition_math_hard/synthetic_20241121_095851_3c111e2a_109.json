  "solution": "Certainly! Here\u2019s how I'll transform the original working-out into a polished, coherent solution while maintaining the authentic thought process. I'll ensure it reads naturally, checks for correctness, and engages the reader effectively.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nFind the value of \\( c \\) such that the inequality \\( x \\cdot (3x + 1) < c \\) holds **if and only if** \\( x \\in \\left( -\\frac{7}{3}, 2 \\right) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Initial Reactions**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, it looks like we're dealing with a quadratic inequality. My brain immediately recalls strategies involving finding the maximum or minimum values of quadratics within a specific interval. Perhaps we need to determine how the quadratic behaves at the endpoints or identify its vertex.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Graphical Approach:** Visualize the quadratic to see its behavior relative to \\( c \\).\n2. **Algebraic Approach:** Solve the inequality directly to find \\( c \\).\n3. **Calculus Approach:** Use derivatives to locate extrema within the interval.\n4. **Test Points:** Evaluate the quadratic at critical points, especially the endpoints.\n\nI'll start with the **graphical approach** to get an intuitive feel, and if that doesn't suffice, I'll pivot to algebraic methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Quadratic Expression**\n\nLet\u2019s write down the inequality:\n\n\\[\nx \\cdot (3x + 1) < c\n\\]\n\nExpanding it:\n\n\\[\n3x^2 + x < c \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 3x^2 + x - c < 0\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- This is a standard quadratic inequality.\n- The expression \\(3x^2 + x - c\\) forms a parabola opening upwards since the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is positive.\n- Our goal is to find \\(c\\) such that the inequality holds **only** within the specified interval.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014if the inequality holds exclusively within \\( \\left( -\\frac{7}{3}, 2 \\right) \\), then at the endpoints \\( x = -\\frac{7}{3} \\) and \\( x = 2 \\), the quadratic should be equal to \\( c \\). This suggests that \\( c \\) is the **maximum** value of the quadratic on this interval.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nTo confirm, let's evaluate the quadratic at the endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating the Quadratic at the Endpoints**\n\n**Endpoint 1: \\( x = -\\frac{7}{3} \\)**\n\n\\[\nf\\left( -\\frac{7}{3} \\right) = 3\\left( -\\frac{7}{3} \\right)^2 + \\left( -\\frac{7}{3} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 3 \\cdot \\frac{49}{9} - \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{147}{9} - \\frac{21}{9} = \\frac{126}{9} = 14\n\\]\n\n**Endpoint 2: \\( x = 2 \\)**\n\n\\[\nf(2) = 3(2)^2 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nInteresting! The quadratic evaluates to **14** at both endpoints.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis implies that \\( c = 14 \\) ensures \\( 3x^2 + x < 14 \\) holds strictly within \\( \\left( -\\frac{7}{3}, 2 \\right) \\). But I need to double-check that there aren't any points inside the interval where the quadratic exceeds 14.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nLet's find the vertex of the parabola to verify whether \\( c = 14 \\) truly represents the maximum value within the interval.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Vertex of the Parabola**\n\nTo ensure that \\( c = 14 \\) is the maximum, I'll locate the vertex of the parabola \\( 3x^2 + x \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nThe vertex of a parabola \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is at:\n\n\\[\nx_{\\text{vertex}} = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{1}{2 \\times 3} = -\\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe vertex lies at \\( x = -\\frac{1}{6} \\), which is within our interval \\( \\left( -\\frac{7}{3}, 2 \\right) \\). This means the quadratic could have a maximum or minimum at this point.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nEvaluate the quadratic at the vertex to see its value relative to 14.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluating the Quadratic at the Vertex**\n\nLet's compute the quadratic at \\( x = -\\frac{1}{6} \\):\n\n\\[\nf\\left( -\\frac{1}{6} \\right) = 3\\left( -\\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 + \\left( -\\frac{1}{6} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{36} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{2}{12} = -\\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThe quadratic reaches \\( -\\frac{1}{12} \\) at the vertex, which is significantly lower than 14.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms that the maximum value within the interval is indeed 14, occurring at the endpoints. The quadratic stays well below 14 throughout the rest of the interval.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nFinalize the answer by ensuring all conditions are satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore concluding, let's recap each step to ensure correctness.\n\n**Recap:**\n\n- **Endpoints Evaluation:** Both \\( x = -\\frac{7}{3} \\) and \\( x = 2 \\) yield a quadratic value of **14**.\n- **Vertex Check:** The vertex at \\( x = -\\frac{1}{6} \\) results in \\( -\\frac{1}{12} \\), confirming no higher values within the interval.\n- **Conclusion:** The maximum value of the quadratic within the interval is **14**, occurring precisely at the endpoints.\n\n**Additional Check:**\n\nSince the inequality \\( 3x^2 + x < 14 \\) holds strictly within \\( \\left( -\\frac{7}{3}, 2 \\right) \\) and equals 14 at the endpoints, \\( c = 14 \\) satisfies the condition.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements. No contradictions or overlooked details are present.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nAll checks are consistent, confirming that \\( c = 14 \\) is the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{c = 14}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy evaluating the quadratic at the endpoints and verifying the vertex's value within the interval, we've confidently determined that \\( c = 14 \\) is the correct solution. Each step aligns with the problem's conditions, ensuring the solution's validity.\n\n---\n\nI've added italics, bolded key points, and formatted equations to enhance readability. The user's genuine thought process is preserved, making the solution both authentic and clear.",
  "ground_truth": "When $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$, we have $x\\cdot(3x+1)-c<0$. This means that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$. We now know that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ is a quadratic equation with roots at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$, and we want to use these roots to find a quadratic of the same form as the problem.  $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ gives us $(3x+7)=0$ and $x=2$ gives us $(x-2)=0$. \\begin{align*}\nx(3x+1)-c&=(3x+7)(x-2)\\\\\n&=3x^2+x-14\\\\\n&=x(3x+1)-14.\n\\end{align*} So, $c=\\boxed{14}$."
