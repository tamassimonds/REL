I know that for a decimal to terminate, the denominator needs specific properties related to its prime factors. But let me double-check my understanding to avoid any oversights.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies: Keeping the Original Insights**\n\n1. **Exploring Terminating Decimals:**  \n   Terminating decimals end after a finite number of digits. This likely ties back to the factors of the denominator.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization Method:**  \n   There's a rule that a fraction's decimal representation terminates if, after simplifying, the denominator only contains the prime factors 2 and 5.\n\n3. **Simplifying the Fraction:**  \n   So, it seems like I need to simplify \\(\\frac{n}{1400}\\) and ensure that the denominator is reduced to only 2s and 5s.\n\n4. **Alternative Approach Using Exponents:**  \n   Maybe expressing 1400 as a product of prime factors can help see how \\( n \\) interacts with them.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe prime factorization method still seems the most straightforward, but I'll remain open to adjusting my approach if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Starting with Prime Factorization: No Change Here**\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorize 1400**  \nLet me break down 1400 into its prime factors:\n\n\\[\n1400 \\div 2 = 700 \\\\\n700 \\div 2 = 350 \\\\\n350 \\div 2 = 175 \\\\\n175 \\div 5 = 35 \\\\\n35 \\div 5 = 7 \\\\\n7 \\div 7 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo,  \n\\[\n1400 = 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^1\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, 1400 is composed of the primes 2, 5, and 7. I recall that for a decimal to terminate, the denominator should only have 2s and 5s. The presence of 7 might be problematic.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis suggests that unless the 7 is eliminated from the denominator through simplification, the decimal won't terminate. I think I'm on the right path!\n\n---\n\n### **Simplifying the Fraction \\(\\frac{n}{1400}\\): Realizing the Mistake**\n\n**Step 2: Conditions for Termination**  \nTo have a terminating decimal, \\(\\frac{n}{1400}\\) must simplify to a fraction whose denominator contains only the primes 2 and 5.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nInitially, I thought \\( n \\) must cancel out the 7 in the denominator by being a multiple of 7. But wait, let me reconsider this...\n\n**Reflection:**  \nActually, looking at this again, only requiring \\( n \\) to be a multiple of 7 might be too restrictive. Hmm, let me double-check my reasoning here. Maybe I've overlooked something.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-examining the Requirements: Correcting the Approach**\n\n**New Insight:**  \nWait a minute, I think I see where I went wrong. For \\(\\frac{n}{1400}\\) to have a terminating decimal, the denominator, after simplification, must **not** have any prime factors other than 2 and 5. This means \\( n \\) needs to cancel out **all** factors of 7 in the denominator.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSo, \\( n \\) must be a multiple of 7 to eliminate the 7 from the denominator. But that's not all\u2014I need to ensure that the simplified denominator only contains 2s and 5s, which means no other primes should remain.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis means I need to count all \\( n \\) that are multiples of 7 within the given range. Let me adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **Finding Eligible \\( n \\) Values: Streamlining the Calculation**\n\n**Step 3: Identifying Multiples of 7**  \nI need to find all integers \\( n \\) between 1 and 1000 that are multiples of 7. This will ensure that the factor of 7 in the denominator is canceled out, leaving only 2s and 5s.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBy making \\( n \\) a multiple of 7, \\(\\frac{n}{1400}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{k}{200}\\) (where \\( k = \\frac{n}{7} \\)), which has a denominator of \\( 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\). This denominator contains only the primes 2 and 5, ensuring a terminating decimal.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems much more straightforward and aligns better with the terminating decimal condition. Let's proceed with this corrected approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating the Number of Valid \\( n \\): Keeping It Simple**\n\n**Step 4: Counting Multiples of 7**  \nNow, I just need to count how many multiples of 7 exist between 1 and 1000.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of multiples of 7} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{7} \\right\\rfloor = 142\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThere are 142 multiples of 7 within the given range. Each of these will cancel out the 7 in the denominator, leaving a simplified fraction with a denominator of \\( 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\), which guarantees a terminating decimal.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis approach is much cleaner and avoids the complications I encountered earlier with the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. It directly addresses the requirement for a terminating decimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying the Corrected Approach**\n\n**Step 5: Sample Test with Smaller Numbers**  \nLet's test this approach with a smaller range to ensure it's correct.\n\n**Sample Test:**  \nConsider \\( n \\) from 1 to 14:\n\n- **Multiples of 7:**  \n  - \\( n = 7 \\): \\(\\frac{7}{1400} = \\frac{1}{200}\\), which terminates.\n  - \\( n = 14 \\): \\(\\frac{14}{1400} = \\frac{1}{100}\\), which terminates.\n\n- **Non-multiples of 7:**  \n  - \\( n = 1 \\): \\(\\frac{1}{1400}\\), denominator includes 7, so it doesn't terminate.\n  - \\( n = 2 \\): \\(\\frac{2}{1400} = \\frac{1}{700}\\), denominator includes 7, so it doesn't terminate.\n  - And so on...\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe test confirms that only multiples of 7 result in terminating decimals, as they eliminate the factor of 7 from the denominator.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis validates the corrected approach. Counting all multiples of 7 within the range accurately captures all \\( n \\) values that lead to terminating decimals.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer: Stating the Correct Solution**\n\n\\(<\\text{ANSWER}>142<\\text{/ANSWER}>\\)\n\n**Solution:**  \nThere are **142** integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{n}{1400}\\) terminates.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Learning from the Correction**\n\nBy initially misapplying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle and realizing the overcomplication, I revisited the fundamental requirement for terminating decimals. Recognizing that canceling out the factor of 7 is sufficient led me to the correct and straightforward solution. Testing the approach with smaller numbers helped verify its validity, ensuring confidence in the final answer.\n\nThroughout the process, being open to re-examining and adjusting my strategy was crucial in arriving at the correct solution, reflecting a natural human problem-solving approach.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step journey highlights the importance of flexibility and reflection in problem-solving, ultimately leading to the correct and efficient solution.",
  "ground_truth": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $1400$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $7$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1000}{7}\\right\\rfloor=142$ multiples of $7$ between $1$ and $1000$, so there are $\\boxed{142}$ integers values for $n$."
