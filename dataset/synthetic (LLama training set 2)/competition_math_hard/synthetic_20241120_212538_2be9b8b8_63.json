    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll try to mimic my natural thinking process, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed. Here we go.\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that:\n\n\\[ 531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24} \\]\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at this, my initial reaction is that we're dealing with a congruence equation involving multiples of \\( n \\). It seems like we might be able to simplify both sides and then solve for \\( n \\). But before jumping in, let's brainstorm some strategies:\n\n1. **Simplify Both Sides:** Maybe subtract one side from the other to see what's left.\n2. **Factor Out \\( n \\):** Since \\( n \\) is common, factoring it out might help.\n3. **Check for Multiplicative Inverses Modulo 24:** Though this seems more complex, it might be necessary if \\( n \\) doesn't directly cancel out.\n4. **Trial and Error with Small \\( n \\):** Might be useful to test small values of \\( n \\) to find the smallest one that works.\n\nI think starting with simplifying the equation makes the most sense. Let's try that first.\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify the Equation**\n\nLet's subtract \\( 1067n \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 531n - 1067n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ -536n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24} \\]\n\nOkay, so now we have \\( -536n \\) congruent to zero modulo 24. My instinct tells me to get rid of the negative sign to make it cleaner:\n\n\\[ 536n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24} \\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nSo far, so good. By simplifying, we've reduced the problem to finding when \\( 536n \\) is divisible by 24. The next logical step seems to be factoring out \\( n \\).\n\n### **Step 2: Factor Out \\( n \\)**\n\nWe can write the equation as:\n\n\\[ 536n = 24k \\]\n\nfor some integer \\( k \\). This implies:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{24k}{536} \\]\n\nBut this doesn't look particularly helpful. Maybe this isn't the right path. Let me think\u2014since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, we really need \\( 536n \\) to be a multiple of 24. Perhaps it's better to see if 536 is divisible by 24 and factor accordingly.\n\n### **Alternate Approach: Divide 536 by 24**\n\nLet\u2019s check if 536 is divisible by 24:\n\n\\[ 536 \\div 24 = 22.333\\ldots \\]\n\nSo, 536 is not divisible by 24. But maybe we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 536 and 24 to simplify further.\n\n### **Step 3: Find GCD of 536 and 24**\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n\\[ 536 \\div 24 = 22 \\text{ remainder } 8 \\]\n\\[ 24 \\div 8 = 3 \\text{ remainder } 0 \\]\n\nSo, the GCD is 8.\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nThis is interesting. The GCD being 8 means that \\( 536n \\) needs to be divisible by 24, which is a multiple of 8. Perhaps we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by their GCD.\n\n### **Step 4: Simplify the Equation by GCD**\n\nSince the GCD is 8, let's divide both sides by 8:\n\n\\[ \\frac{536n}{8} \\equiv \\frac{0}{8} \\pmod{\\frac{24}{8}} \\]\n\\[ 67n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\]\n\nSo now we have a much simpler equation: \\( 67n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\).\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nThis looks promising. We need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( 67n \\) is divisible by 3. Since 67 and 3 are coprime, \\( n \\) must be a multiple of 3. Let's proceed with this.\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the Smallest \\( n \\)**\n\nSince \\( 67n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) and 67 is not divisible by 3, \\( n \\) must be divisible by 3. Therefore, the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) is:\n\n\\[ n = 3 \\]\n\n### **Checkpoint: Verify the Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s verify if \\( n = 3 \\) satisfies the original equation:\n\n\\[ 531 \\times 3 = 1593 \\]\n\\[ 1067 \\times 3 = 3201 \\]\n\\[ 1593 \\equiv 3201 \\pmod{24} \\]\n\\[ 3201 - 1593 = 1608 \\]\n\\[ 1608 \\div 24 = 67 \\text{ remainder } 0 \\]\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the congruence holds. Therefore, \\( n = 3 \\) is indeed the correct answer.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, simplifying the equation by factoring out \\( n \\) and using the GCD led us to a straightforward solution. Verifying the answer confirmed its correctness. Initially, I considered factoring \\( n \\) directly, but realizing that simplifying the coefficients modulo 24 was more efficient. This step-by-step approach ensured that we arrived at the correct solution systematically.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe smallest positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies \\( 531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

In other words,  $$\\frac{1067n-531n}{24} = \\frac{536n}{24}=\\frac{67n}{3}$$must be an integer.
