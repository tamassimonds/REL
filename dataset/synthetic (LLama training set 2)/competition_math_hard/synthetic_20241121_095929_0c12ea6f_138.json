  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem just like we would in real life, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking our work along the way. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming various approaches, see which one makes sense, and adjust as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  Okay, we're dealing with picking six distinct integers from 1 to 10, and we need the second smallest to be 3. This reminds me of problems involving ordered selections or permutations.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**  \n  1. **Counting Total Ways:** Calculate the total number of ways to pick six integers and then find the cases where the second smallest is 3.\n  2. **Fixing Positions:** Fix 3 as the second smallest and count the valid combinations for the other numbers.\n  3. **Complement Approach:** Consider the probability of the second smallest not being 3 and subtract from 1.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Each strategy has its merits, but starting with the total number of ways seems straightforward. Let's explore that first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Total Ways to Pick Six Integers**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  We need the total number of ways to select six distinct integers from a set of ten. This is a straightforward combination problem.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total ways} = \\binom{10}{6} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 210\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:**  \n  Does this make sense? Yes, using combinations ensures we're counting all possible selections without regard to order.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Focusing on Successful Outcomes**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Now, let's focus on the cases where the second smallest number is 3. This means:\n\n  - **The smallest number must be 1 or 2.**\n  - **The number 3 must be included.**\n  - **Three more numbers need to be selected from the remaining seven integers (4 to 10).**\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Wait, is that correct? If the second smallest is 3, then 1 or 2 must be present, and 3 is fixed. So, we\u2019re left with picking the remaining numbers from those greater than 3.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Successful Outcomes**\n\n**Approach 1: Fixing the Smallest Number**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Let\u2019s break it down based on whether the smallest number is 1 or 2.\n\n  **Case 1: Smallest Number is 1**\n  \n  - **Numbers Selected:**  \n    1 and 3 are fixed.\n  \n  - **Remaining to Pick:**  \n    Four more numbers from 4 to 10.\n  \n  - **Calculation:**  \n    \\[\n    \\binom{7}{4} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n    \\]\n  \n  **Case 2: Smallest Number is 2**\n  \n  - **Numbers Selected:**  \n    2 and 3 are fixed.\n  \n  - **Remaining to Pick:**  \n    Four more numbers from 4 to 10.\n  \n  - **Calculation:**  \n    \\[\n    \\binom{7}{4} = 35\n    \\]\n  \n- **Total Successful Outcomes:**  \n  \\[\n  35 + 35 = 70\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Does this add up? Yes, both cases are mutually exclusive and exhaust all possibilities where the second smallest is 3.\n\n**Approach 2: Considering Different Selection of Numbers**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Let's assign the remaining four positions to numbers greater than 3. \n\n- **But Wait:**  \n  This approach seems convoluted compared to fixing the smallest number. Let's stick with the first method for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Probability**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Probability is the ratio of successful outcomes to the total number of outcomes.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{second smallest is } 3) = \\frac{70}{210} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:**  \n  Simplifying \\( \\frac{70}{210} \\) gives \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), which aligns with our calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Reflecting on the Solution**\n\n- **Final Check:**  \n  Does the probability \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) make sense in the context? Given that there are three possible scenarios for the second smallest (being 1, 2, or 3), this probability seems reasonable.\n\n- **Alternate Thinking:**  \n  Could there be another way to verify? Perhaps using simulations or a different counting method, but our initial approach is robust.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The probability that the second smallest number is 3 is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(<ANSWER> \\frac{1}{3} \\) solution</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy brainstorming different strategies, calculating both total and successful outcomes, and continuously reflecting and checking our work, we arrived at the correct probability \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).",
  "ground_truth": "The total number of ways to choose 6 numbers is ${10\\choose 6} = 210$.\nAssume $3$ is the second-lowest number. There are $5$ numbers left to choose, $4$ of which must be greater than $3$, and $1$ of which must be less than $3$. This is equivalent to choosing $4$ numbers from the $7$ numbers larger than $3$, and $1$ number from the $2$ numbers less than $3$.\\[{7\\choose 4} {2\\choose 1}= 35\\times2\\].\nThus, $\\frac{35\\times2}{210} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
