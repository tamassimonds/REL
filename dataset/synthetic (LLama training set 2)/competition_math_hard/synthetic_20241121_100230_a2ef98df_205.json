  "solution": "---\n\n**Brainstorming and First Thoughts**\n\nLet's dive into this problem. When I first glance at it, I see a **5 by 5 grid of points** with a **larger square** and a **shaded square** inside. The question asks for the fraction of the larger square's area that is occupied by the shaded square.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- This reminds me of problems involving **squares within squares**, possibly dealing with **ratios of areas**.\n- I remember that the area of a square is proportional to the **square of its side length**, so that might be useful.\n- I'm not entirely sure how the shaded square is positioned\u2014perhaps it's rotated? I'll need to explore that.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Wait**, if the shaded square is rotated, its sides might align differently with the grid points. That could affect how I calculate its area.\n- **Hmm**, maybe I can use **geometry** or even some **coordinate geometry** to figure this out.\n\n---\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies**\n\nTo tackle this, I'll brainstorm a few strategies:\n\n1. **Calculate the Areas Directly:**\n   - Find the area of both squares and take the ratio.\n   - *But,* I'm not sure how to directly find the shaded square's area yet.\n\n2. **Use Coordinates and Geometry:**\n   - Assign coordinates to the grid points and use them to compute areas.\n   - This seems promising since the grid is laid out with specific points.\n\n3. **Symmetry and Proportions:**\n   - Consider the symmetry of the squares to simplify the problem.\n   - Could be useful if the shaded square has a particular orientation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I think starting with **coordinates and geometry** might be the most straightforward approach. It allows me to assign specific points and calculate areas precisely.\n- If that gets complicated, I can always switch to looking at **symmetry** or another method.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Grid and Assigning Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's assign coordinates to the grid points to make calculations easier.\n- It's a **5 by 5 grid**, so I'll label the points from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((4,4)\\).\n- The larger square is the boundary from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((4,4)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a minute**, the grid is 5 by 5, but the coordinates go from 0 to 4. That means there are **5 intervals** in each direction, so the side length of the larger square is **4 units**.\n- That makes sense since the distance from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((4,0)\\) is 4 units.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The **larger square\u2019s side length** is **4 units**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Shaded Square's Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Looking at the Asymptote code provided, the shaded square is defined by the points \\((2,2)\\), \\((3,3)\\), \\((2,4)\\), and \\((1,3)\\).\n- Let's list these points to visualize the square:\n\n  - \\(A = (2,2)\\)\n  - \\(B = (3,3)\\)\n  - \\(C = (2,4)\\)\n  - \\(D = (1,3)\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Hmm**, these points suggest that the shaded square is **rotated** within the larger square.\n- **Oh!** This reminds me of a **square rotated by 45 degrees** (a diamond shape), which often occurs in such problems.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The **shaded square** is positioned with its vertices touching specific grid points, likely rotated.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Verifying the Shaded Square is a Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Before proceeding, I should **verify** that the shaded figure is indeed a square.\n- I can do this by checking the **distances between consecutive vertices** to ensure all sides are equal and the **angles are right angles**.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Distance AB:**\n   - Points: \\(A = (2,2)\\), \\(B = (3,3)\\)\n   - Distance = \\(\\sqrt{(3-2)^2 + (3-2)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n2. **Distance BC:**\n   - Points: \\(B = (3,3)\\), \\(C = (2,4)\\)\n   - Distance = \\(\\sqrt{(2-3)^2 + (4-3)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n3. **Distance CD:**\n   - Points: \\(C = (2,4)\\), \\(D = (1,3)\\)\n   - Distance = \\(\\sqrt{(1-2)^2 + (3-4)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n4. **Distance DA:**\n   - Points: \\(D = (1,3)\\), \\(A = (2,2)\\)\n   - Distance = \\(\\sqrt{(2-1)^2 + (2-3)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- All **four sides** are equal to \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n- **Wait**, but I also need to check the **angles** to ensure they are **right angles**.\n\n**Checking Angles:**\n\n- I can use the **dot product** to check if adjacent sides are **perpendicular**.\n\n1. **Angle at A between DA and AB:**\n   - Vector DA = \\((2-1, 2-3) = (1, -1)\\)\n   - Vector AB = \\((3-2, 3-2) = (1, 1)\\)\n   - Dot product = \\(1 \\times 1 + (-1) \\times 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\\)\n\n2. **Angle at B between AB and BC:**\n   - Vector AB = \\((1, 1)\\)\n   - Vector BC = \\((2-3, 4-3) = (-1, 1)\\)\n   - Dot product = \\(1 \\times (-1) + 1 \\times 1 = -1 + 1 = 0\\)\n\n3. **Angle at C between BC and CD:**\n   - Vector BC = \\((-1, 1)\\)\n   - Vector CD = \\((1-2, 3-4) = (-1, -1)\\)\n   - Dot product = \\(-1 \\times (-1) + 1 \\times (-1) = 1 - 1 = 0\\)\n\n4. **Angle at D between CD and DA:**\n   - Vector CD = \\((-1, -1)\\)\n   - Vector DA = \\((1, -1)\\)\n   - Dot product = \\(-1 \\times 1 + (-1) \\times (-1) = -1 + 1 = 0\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- All **dot products** are **zero**, indicating that all **angles are right angles**.\n- **Great!** This confirms that the shaded figure is indeed a **square**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The **shaded figure** is a **square** with side lengths of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and all **right angles**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Area of the Larger Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, let's find the area of the **larger square**.\n- Since the side length is **4 units**, I can use the formula:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\text{side}^2 = 4^2 = 16 \\text{ square units}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait**, that seems straightforward. The larger square covers the entire grid from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((4,4)\\), so **16 square units** makes sense.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The **area of the larger square** is **16 square units**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Area of the Shaded Square Using Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the area of the **shaded square**, I can use the **coordinates** of its vertices.\n- One method is to use the **Shoelace Theorem** (or the **Surveyor's Formula**), which is straightforward for polygons with known vertices.\n\n**Applying the Shoelace Theorem:**\n\n- List the vertices in order:\n  \\[\n  A = (2,2), B = (3,3), C = (2,4), D = (1,3)\n  \\]\n\n- Formula for area:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum (x_i \\cdot y_{i+1}) - \\sum (y_i \\cdot x_{i+1}) \\right|\n  \\]\n  \n- Plugging in the values:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (2 \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 2 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot 2) - (2 \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot 2 + 4 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 2) \\right|\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (6 + 12 + 6 + 2) - (6 + 6 + 4 + 6) \\right|\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 26 - 22 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 2 \\text{ square units}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Hmm**, so the area of the shaded square is **2 square units**.\n- **Wait a minute**, since the larger square is **16 square units**, the fraction should be straightforward to compute.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The **area of the shaded square** is **2 square units**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Determining the Fraction of the Larger Square\u2019s Area**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I need to find what fraction **2 square units** is of **16 square units**.\n- Simple ratio:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Area of Shaded Square}}{\\text{Area of Larger Square}} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Oh!** That simplifies nicely to **\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)**.\n- **Quick Check:** If the shaded square is **2 square units** and the larger square is **16 square units**, then \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) makes sense numerically.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The **fraction of the larger square's area** occupied by the **shaded square** is **\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Verifying the Solution with an Alternative Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- It's always a good idea to **verify** the solution using a different approach to ensure accuracy.\n- Let's consider another method: **Using the properties of a rotated square**.\n\n**Alternative Method:**\n\n- The shaded square is **rotated by 45 degrees** within the larger square.\n- Typically, when a square is rotated by 45 degrees, its **diagonals align with the axes**.\n- The length of the **diagonal** of the shaded square can be calculated from its vertices.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Finding the Diagonal of the Shaded Square:**\n   - The diagonal connects opposite vertices, say \\(A = (2,2)\\) and \\(C = (2,4)\\).\n   - Length = \\(\\sqrt{(2-2)^2 + (4-2)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 4} = 2\\) units.\n\n2. **Relating Diagonal to Side Length:**\n   - For a square, the diagonal \\(d\\) is related to the side length \\(s\\) by:\n     \\[\n     d = s\\sqrt{2} \\implies s = \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n  \n3. **Calculating the Area:**\n   - Area = \\(s^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2\\) square units.\n  \n4. **Fraction of the Larger Square:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Area of Shaded Square}}{\\text{Area of Larger Square}} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait**, this alternative method confirms the same result.\n- **Great!** It reinforces that the **fraction is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)**.\n- **Quick Check:** Both methods agree, which adds confidence to the solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The **fraction of the larger square\u2019s area** occupied by the **shaded square** is **\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)**, verified by multiple methods.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- By exploring different strategies, assigning coordinates, and verifying through multiple methods, I've confidently determined the fraction.\n- **Oh!** Initially, I wasn't sure about the orientation of the shaded square, but by analyzing the coordinates and using the Shoelace Theorem, the solution became clear.\n- **Quick Check:** Both direct calculation and alternative verification led to the same fraction, ensuring accuracy.\n\n<ANSWER> solution: \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) </ANSWER>\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Lesson Learned:** Taking the time to verify the solution through different approaches not only confirms correctness but also deepens understanding.\n- **Key Insight:** Assigning coordinates and applying geometric theorems (like the Shoelace Theorem) can simplify seemingly complex problems.\n- **Eureka Moment:** Realizing that the shaded square is rotated and calculating its area relative to the larger square clarified the fraction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The **fraction of the larger square\u2019s area** that is inside the **shaded square** is **\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)**.\n\n---\n\nBy following a thorough, step-by-step approach\u2014brainstorming, exploring multiple strategies, verifying through alternative methods, and reflecting at each stage\u2014I arrived at the correct solution while ensuring the thought process remained clear and logical.",
  "ground_truth": "Since the side of the shaded square is a diagonal of the smaller squares, it has area $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$ square units. The whole grid has area $4^2 = 16$ units, so the ratio of areas is $\\frac{2}{16} =\\boxed{\\frac 18}$."
