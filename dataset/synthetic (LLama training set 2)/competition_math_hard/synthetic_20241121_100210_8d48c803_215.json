  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem again, but this time I'll streamline the thought process to create a more concise and coherent solution. I\u2019ll still walk through the steps methodically, ensuring clarity and correctness, just like I would when solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Recap**\n\nWe have a piece of cheese at \\((12,10)\\) and a mouse starting at \\((4,-2)\\), moving along the line \\(y = -5x + 18\\). The goal is to find the point \\((a,b)\\) where the mouse starts getting farther from the cheese rather than closer, and finally compute \\(a + b\\).\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see this, I immediately think about **distance minimization**\u2014finding the point along the mouse's path where it's closest to the cheese before starting to move away. This suggests using the **Distance Formula** and possibly **calculus** to find the minimum distance point.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Distance Formula Approach:**\n   - Calculate the distance between the mouse and the cheese as a function of \\(x\\) and find where this distance is minimized.\n\n2. **Derivative (Calculus) Method:**\n   - Use calculus to determine where the rate of change of the distance is zero, indicating a minimum point.\n\n3. **Geometric Interpretation:**\n   - Identify where the mouse's path is tangent to a circle centered at the cheese\u2019s location.\n\nGiven these options, the **Distance Formula Approach** combined with **calculus** seems straightforward, so I'll start there. If it gets too cumbersome, I can reconsider other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expressing the Distance**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's express the distance \\(D\\) between the mouse\u2019s position and the cheese as a function of \\(x\\). By minimizing this distance, we can find the point where the mouse is closest to the cheese.\n\n**Calculation:**\nUsing the **Distance Formula**:\n\n\\[\nD(x) = \\sqrt{(x - 12)^2 + (y - 10)^2}\n\\]\n\nSince the mouse moves along the line \\(y = -5x + 18\\), substitute \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nD(x) = \\sqrt{(x - 12)^2 + ((-5x + 18) - 10)^2)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the square root:\n\n\\[\nD(x) = \\sqrt{(x - 12)^2 + (-5x + 8)^2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis expression looks manageable, but differentiating it directly might be tricky due to the square root. To simplify, let's consider minimizing \\(D(x)^2\\) instead, which eliminates the square root and makes differentiation easier.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Minimizing the Squared Distance**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBy minimizing \\(D(x)^2\\), we avoid dealing with the square root, making the calculus part simpler. The minimum of \\(D(x)\\) occurs at the same \\(x\\) as the minimum of \\(D(x)^2\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nD^2(x) = (x - 12)^2 + (-5x + 8)^2\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to find the value of \\(x\\) that minimizes \\(D^2(x)\\). To do this, we'll take the derivative of \\(D^2(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\), set it to zero, and solve for \\(x\\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx}[(x - 12)^2 + (-5x + 8)^2] = 0\n\\]\n\nCompute the derivative:\n\n\\[\n2(x - 12) + 2(-5x + 8)(-5) = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n2(x - 12) - 10(-5x + 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\n\\[\n2x - 24 + 50x - 80 = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n52x - 104 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n52x = 104 \\\\\nx = \\frac{104}{52} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Checking Work:**\nThe calculations seem correct, but it's always good to double-check. Let\u2019s quickly verify the differentiation steps to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Derivative Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nRe-examining the differentiation to confirm accuracy is crucial, especially when the solution appears straightforward.\n\n**Re-checking Calculation:**\n\nOriginal derivative setup:\n\n\\[\n2(x - 12) + 2(-5x + 8)(-5) = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n1. \\(2(x - 12) = 2x - 24\\)\n2. \\(2(-5x + 8)(-5) = -10(-5x + 8) = 50x - 80\\)\n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\[\n2x - 24 + 50x - 80 = 0\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[\n52x - 104 = 0 \\\\\n52x = 104 \\\\\nx = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe calculations are indeed correct. The value \\(x = 2\\) makes sense. Now, let's proceed to find the corresponding \\(y\\) coordinate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Corresponding \\(y\\) Coordinate**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince the mouse moves along the line \\(y = -5x + 18\\), we can plug \\(x = 2\\) into this equation to find \\(y\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\ny = -5(2) + 18 = -10 + 18 = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, the point \\((a, b)\\) is \\((2, 8)\\).\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Let\u2019s quickly verify by plugging back into the original line equation:\n\n\\[\ny = -5(2) + 18 = 8 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating \\(a + b\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, we simply add the coordinates of the point where the mouse starts getting farther from the cheese.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\na + b = 2 + 8 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\nDoes this result align with the problem's requirements? Yes, we've correctly identified the point \\((2, 8)\\) where the mouse's distance from the cheese starts increasing, and the sum \\(a + b = 10\\) makes sense.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER> 10 solution</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies and choosing the **Distance Formula Approach** combined with **calculus**, we successfully determined the point where the mouse begins to move away from the cheese. Regular checks and reflections ensured the correctness of each step, leading us to the final sum \\(a + b = 10\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy brainstorming, checking our work regularly, and remaining open to adjusting our approach, we ensured a robust solution to the problem. This step-by-step process not only led us to the correct answer but also enhanced our problem-solving skills by encouraging thorough exploration and verification.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach Reflection**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nConsidering alternative methods can validate our solution and provide deeper insights.\n\n1. **Geometric Interpretation:**\n   - Visualizing the mouse's path as a line and the cheese's position as a fixed point, the problem can be seen as finding the closest point on the line to the cheese. This is where a perpendicular from the cheese's location intersects the line.\n\n2. **Using Projections:**\n   - Another method could involve projecting the cheese\u2019s position onto the mouse\u2019s path to directly find the closest point.\n\n**Reflection:**\nWhile these alternative methods offer a more intuitive understanding, the calculus approach we used was straightforward and effective. Considering multiple strategies helps in verifying the solution's correctness and deepening our understanding of the problem.\n\n---\n\nSo, by meticulously following each step and verifying our calculations, we've confidently arrived at the final answer: \\(a + b = 10\\).",
  "ground_truth": "The  point $(a,b)$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $(12,10)$ to the line $y=-5x+18$.  The perpendicular has slope $\\frac{1}{5}$, so its equation is \\[\ny=10+\\frac{1}{5}(x-12)=\\frac{1}{5}x+\\frac{38}{5}.\n\\]The $x$-coordinate at the foot of the perpendicular satisfies the equation \\[\n\\frac{1}{5}x+\\frac{38}{5}=-5x+18,\n\\]so $x=2$ and $y=-5\\cdot2+18=8$. Thus $(a,b) = (2,8)$, and $a+b = \\boxed{10}$."
