  "solution": "### Solving the Problem: Finding Positive Integers \\( n \\) \n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like how I would approach it naturally. I'll walk through my initial thoughts, brainstorming different strategies, checking for correctness along the way, and adjusting as needed to ensure the solution is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\( n^2 + 12n - 2007 \\) needing to be a perfect square, my mind immediately thinks:\n\n- **This resembles a quadratic problem.** Maybe I need to set it equal to another perfect square and solve for \\( n \\).\n- **Completing the square could be helpful,** but I'm not entirely sure if that's the best route.\n- **Alternatively, setting up the equation as a difference of squares might simplify things.**\n\nI'm uncertain which method will be the most efficient, so I'll explore multiple strategies to see which one works best.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**1. Completing the Square:**\n\n- **Pros:** Familiar method for dealing with quadratics.\n- **Cons:** Might get complicated with large numbers like 2007.\n\n**2. Setting Up as Two Perfect Squares:**\n\n- **Pros:** Could lead to a simpler linear equation.\n- **Cons:** Involves more algebraic manipulation.\n\n**3. Using the Quadratic Formula:**\n\n- **Pros:** Direct application of a known formula.\n- **Cons:** The discriminant needs to be a perfect square, which adds complexity.\n\nGiven these options, I'll start with **completing the square** to see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Completing the Square**\n\nLet's transform \\( n^2 + 12n \\) into a perfect square.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Thought Process</summary>\n  \n- To complete the square, I need to rewrite \\( n^2 + 12n \\) as \\( (n + 6)^2 \\), because:\n  \\[\n  (n + 6)^2 = n^2 + 12n + 36\n  \\]\n  \n- Subtracting 36 to adjust:\n  \\[\n  n^2 + 12n = (n + 6)^2 - 36\n  \\]\n  \n</details>\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 12n - 2007 = (n + 6)^2 - 36 - 2007 = (n + 6)^2 - 2043\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(n + 6)^2 - k^2 = 2043\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This is a **difference of squares**, which is promising because it can be factored. \n- **Wait a minute\u2014** factoring might involve dealing with large numbers. Is this the best approach? Let's proceed and see.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Factoring as a Difference of Squares**\n\nApply the difference of squares formula: \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Thought Process</summary>\n  \n- Set \\( a = n + 6 \\) and \\( b = k \\).\n  \n- Rewriting the equation:\n  \\[\n  (n + 6 - k)(n + 6 + k) = 2043\n  \\]\n  \n- Now, I need to find integer pairs \\((m, M)\\) such that their product is 2043.\n  \n</details>\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- To find \\( n \\), I'll express it in terms of \\( m \\) and \\( M \\):\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{m + M}{2} - 6\n  \\]\n  \n- **But wait,** for \\( n \\) to be an integer, \\( \\frac{m + M}{2} \\) must be an integer. So, \\( m + M \\) needs to be even.\n\n- Let's factor 2043 to find all such pairs.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Factoring 2043**\n\nBegin by finding the prime factors of 2043.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Thought Process</summary>\n  \n- **First, check divisibility by small primes:**\n  \n  - **2:** 2043 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n  \n  - **3:** Sum of digits \\( 2 + 0 + 4 + 3 = 9 \\), which is divisible by 3.\n  \n- **Divide 2043 by 3:**\n  \\[\n  2043 \\div 3 = 681\n  \\]\n  \n- **Now, factor 681:**\n  \n  - **3:** Sum of digits \\( 6 + 8 + 1 = 15 \\), divisible by 3.\n  \\[\n  681 \\div 3 = 227\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check 227:** It's a prime number (not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13).\n  \n</details>\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\\[\n2043 = 3^2 \\times 227\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Alright,** since 227 is prime, the factor pairs of 2043 are:\n  - \\( (1, 2043) \\)\n  - \\( (3, 681) \\)\n  - \\( (9, 227) \\)\n  \n- **Do I have all the factors?** Yes, those are all the pairs.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Setting Up Equations from Factor Pairs**\n\nFor each factor pair \\((m, M)\\), set up the equations:\n\n\\[\nn + 6 - k = m \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n + 6 + k = M\n\\]\n\nAdding these:\n\n\\[\n2(n + 6) = m + M \\implies n = \\frac{m + M}{2} - 6\n\\]\n\n<details>\n<summary>Thought Process</summary>\n  \n- I need \\( n \\) to be a **positive integer**, so \\( \\frac{m + M}{2} -

6 = \\frac{2044}{2} - 6 = 1022 - 6 = 1016\n\\]\n  \n**Factor Pair 2: \\( (3, 681) \\)**\n  \n\\[\nn = \\frac{3 + 681}{2} - 6 = \\frac{684}{2} - 6 = 342 - 6 = 336\n\\]\n  \n**Factor Pair 3: \\( (9, 227) \\)**\n  \n\\[\nn = \\frac{9 + 227}{2} - 6 = \\frac{236}{2} - 6 = 118 - 6 = 112\n\\]\n  \n</details>\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I've found three positive integer solutions: \\( n = 1016, 336, 112 \\).\n  \n- **Wait, let me double-check these calculations** to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Double-Checking the Solutions**\n\nSubstitute each \\( n \\) back into the original equation to verify that \\( n^2 + 12n - 2007 \\) is a perfect square.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Thought Process</summary>\n  \n- This step is crucial to confirm that the solutions are correct.\n  \n- If any \\( n \\) doesn't satisfy the condition, I need to revisit my calculations.\n  \n</details>\n\n**Checking \\( n = 1016 \\):**\n\n\\[\n1016^2 + 12 \\times 1016 - 2007 = 1{,}032{,}256 + 12{,}192 - 2{,}007 = 1{,}042{,}441\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1{,}042{,}441} = 1{,}021 \\quad (\\text{which is an integer})\n\\]\n\n**Result:** Perfect square.\n\n**Checking \\( n = 336 \\):**\n\n\\[\n336^2 + 12 \\times 336 -

  "ground_truth": "If $n^2 + 12n - 2007 = m^2$, we can complete the square on the left-hand side to get $n^2 + 12n + 36 = m^2 + 2043$ so $(n+6)^2 = m^2 + 2043$. Subtracting $m^2$ and factoring the left-hand side, we get $(n + m + 6)(n - m + 6) = 2043$. $2043 = 3^2 \\cdot 227$, which can be split into two factors in 3 ways, $2043 \\cdot 1 = 3 \\cdot 681 = 227 \\cdot 9$. This gives us three pairs of equations to solve for $n$:\n$n + m + 6 = 2043$ and $n - m + 6 = 1$ give $2n + 12 = 2044$ and $n = 1016$.\n$n + m + 6 = 681$ and $n - m + 6 = 3$ give $2n + 12 = 684$ and $n = 336$.\n$n + m + 6 = 227$ and $n - m + 6 = 9$ give $2n + 12 = 236$ and $n = 112$.\nFinally, $1016 + 336 + 112 = 1464$, so the answer is $\\boxed{464}$."
