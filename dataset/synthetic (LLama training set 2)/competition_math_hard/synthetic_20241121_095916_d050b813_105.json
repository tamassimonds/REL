  "solution": "Sure, let's consolidate the initial brainstorming and working out into a coherent, complete solution while maintaining the original thought process. I'll ensure that the final answer remains unchanged, reflecting the journey from the initial idea to the final conclusion.\n\n---\n\n## **First Impressions and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen faced with the problem, my immediate thoughts were reminiscent of quadratic equations and integer solutions. The key conditions are:\n\n1. \\( a \\) is a positive integer less than or equal to 50.\n2. The quadratic equation \\( x^2 + (2a+1)x + a^2 = 0 \\) must have two integer solutions.\n\n**Initial Strategies Considered:**\n\n- **Factoring the Quadratic:** If the equation can be expressed as a product of linear terms with integer coefficients, the solutions would naturally be integers.\n  \n- **Using the Quadratic Formula:** Ensuring that the discriminant is a perfect square to yield integer solutions.\n  \n- **Analyzing the Discriminant:** Since the discriminant determines the nature of roots, making it a perfect square seems essential.\n\nGiven these options, starting with factoring appears straightforward. However, if that approach becomes cumbersome, the quadratic formula serves as a reliable alternative. Let's proceed step by step, ready to pivot if necessary.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Attempting to Factor the Quadratic**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFactoring quadratics is often an efficient way to find integer solutions. Let's attempt to express the quadratic as:\n\n\\[\n(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0\n\\]\n\nExpanding this yields:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1r_2 = 0\n\\]\n\nComparing with our original equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + (2a+1)x + a^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe can equate:\n\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 = -(2a + 1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r_1r_2 = a^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis sets up two conditions involving \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\). Since both need to be integers, there might be relationships between them and \\( a \\). However, this approach feels abstract and might not directly lead us to the desired \\( a \\) values. It seems less straightforward than initially anticipated. Perhaps exploring another method would be more effective.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nShifting gears, let's apply the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(2a+1) \\pm \\sqrt{(2a+1)^2 - 4a^2}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n(2a+1)^2 - 4a^2 = 4a^2 + 4a + 1 - 4a^2 = 4a + 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the roots become:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(2a+1) \\pm \\sqrt{4a + 1}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Insight:**\n\nFor the solutions to be integers, \\(\\sqrt{4a + 1}\\) must be an integer. This ensures that the numerator is an integer, leading to integer roots.\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis approach seems logical. If \\(4a + 1\\) is a perfect square, say \\(k^2\\), then:\n\n\\[\n4a + 1 = k^2 \\implies 4a = k^2 - 1 \\implies a = \\frac{k^2 - 1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHowever, \\( a \\) must be a positive integer. Therefore, \\( \\frac{k^2 - 1}{4} \\) needs to be an integer, imposing conditions on \\( k \\). This pathway appears promising. Let's delve deeper.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Finding Appropriate \\( k \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{k^2 - 1}{4}\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to find integer \\( k \\) such that \\( k^2 - 1 \\) is divisible by 4, and \\( a \\) lies within \\( 1 \\leq a \\leq 50 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 1 = 4a \\implies k^2 = 4a + 1\n\\]\n\nNotably, \\( k \\) must be an odd integer because:\n\n- If \\( k \\) is odd, \\( k^2 \\) is odd, making \\( 4a + 1 \\) odd (since 1 is odd).\n\nThis ensures that \\( 4a + 1 \\) is a perfect square.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nNow, let's list possible \\( k \\) values and calculate the corresponding \\( a \\) to identify those within the desired range.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Listing Possible \\( k \\) and \\( a \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nStarting with \\( k = 1 \\) and incrementing by 2 (since \\( k \\) must be odd), we'll compute \\( a \\) for each \\( k \\) until \\( a \\) exceeds 50.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's create a table to track our findings:\n\n| \\( k \\) | \\( k^2 \\) | \\( k^2 - 1 \\) | \\( a = \\frac{k^2 - 1}{4} \\) | \\( a \\leq 50 \\)? |\n|---------|----------|--------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| 1       | 1        | 0            | 0                          | No               |\n| 3       | 9        | 8            | 2                          | Yes              |\n| 5       | 25       | 24           | 6                          | Yes              |\n| 7       | 49       | 48           | 12                         | Yes              |\n| 9       | 81       | 80           | 20                         | Yes              |\n| 11      | 121      | 120          | 30                         | Yes              |\n| 13      | 169      | 168          | 42                         | Yes              |\n| 15      | 225      | 224          | 56                         | No               |\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFrom \\( k = 15 \\) onward, \\( a \\) exceeds 50, so we can stop there. The \\( a \\) values within the range are: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42.\n\nThis method seems effective. However, it's essential to verify whether each \\( a \\) satisfies the original quadratic equation\u2019s condition of having two integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Verifying Integer Solutions for Each \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEven though we've identified \\( a \\) values that make \\( \\sqrt{4a + 1} \\) an integer, it's prudent to verify that the corresponding quadratic equations indeed have two distinct integer roots.\n\n**Check:**\n\nFor each \\( a \\), compute the roots using the quadratic formula to ensure they are distinct integers.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet\u2019s verify each \\( a \\) value:\n\n1. **\\( a = 2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-(2(2) + 1) \\pm \\sqrt{4(2) + 1}}{2} = \\frac{-5 \\pm 3}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x_1 = \\frac{-5 + 3}{2} = -1, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{-5 - 3}{2} = -4\n   \\]\n   **Result:** Two distinct integer roots: -1 and -4.\n\n2. **\\( a = 6 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-(2(6) + 1) \\pm \\sqrt{4(6) + 1}}{2} = \\frac{-13 \\pm 5}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x_1 = \\frac{-13 + 5}{2} = -4, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{-13 - 5}{2} = -9\n   \\]\n   **Result:** Two distinct integer roots: -4 and -9.\n\n3. **\\( a = 12 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-(2(12) + 1) \\pm \\sqrt{4(12) + 1}}{2} = \\frac{-25 \\pm 7}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x_1 = \\frac{-25 + 7}{2} = -9, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{-25 - 7}{2} = -16\n   \\]\n   **Result:** Two distinct integer roots: -9 and -16.\n\n4. **\\( a = 20 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-(2(20) + 1) \\pm \\sqrt{4(20) + 1}}{2} = \\frac{-41 \\pm 9}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x_1 = \\frac{-41 + 9}{2} = -16, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{-41 - 9}{2} = -25\n   \\]\n   **Result:** Two distinct integer roots: -16 and -25.\n\n5. **\\( a = 30 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-(2(30) + 1) \\pm \\sqrt{4(30) + 1}}{2} = \\frac{-61 \\pm 11}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x_1 = \\frac{-61 + 11}{2} = -25, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{-61 - 11}{2} = -36\n   \\]\n   **Result:** Two distinct integer roots: -25 and -36.\n\n6. **\\( a = 42 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-(2(42) + 1) \\pm \\sqrt{4(42) + 1}}{2} = \\frac{-85 \\pm 13}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x_1 = \\frac{-85 + 13}{2} = -36, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{-85 - 13}{2} = -49\n   \\]\n   **Result:** Two distinct integer roots: -36 and -49.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAll the \\( a \\) values yield two distinct integer roots, confirming that our approach is correct. This verification step is crucial to ensure the validity of our solution.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's recap to ensure all conditions are satisfied:\n\n- \\( a \\) is a positive integer \\( \\leq 50 \\).\n- The quadratic equation has two distinct integer solutions for each \\( a \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nAll identified \\( a \\) values (2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42) meet both conditions. There are no missing \\( a \\) values within the given range.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThe systematic exploration and verification confirm the correctness of the solution. Regular checks throughout the process helped maintain accuracy, leading to a reliable conclusion.\n\n---\n\n## **<ANSWER>solution</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\nThere are **6** values of \\( a \\) that satisfy both conditions:\n\n- \\( a = 2 \\)\n- \\( a = 6 \\)\n- \\( a = 12 \\)\n- \\( a = 20 \\)\n- \\( a = 30 \\)\n- \\( a = 42 \\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is **6**.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Considered multiple strategies like factoring and using the quadratic formula.\n- **Exploration:** Attempted factoring but transitioned to the quadratic formula for clarity.\n- **Calculations:** Determined that \\( \\sqrt{4a + 1} \\) must be an integer and identified corresponding \\( a \\) values.\n- **Verification:** Confirmed that each \\( a \\) leads to two distinct integer roots.\n- **Final Check:** Ensured all conditions were met before finalizing the answer.\n\nThroughout the process, regular reflections and checks helped maintain correctness, leading to an accurate and reliable solution.\n\n---\n\nBy following a structured approach\u2014starting with brainstorming, testing different strategies, verifying results, and continuously reflecting\u2014we ensured that the solution is both correct and complete.\n\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions, I'd be happy to incorporate them!",
  "ground_truth": "If the quadratic equation $x^2 + (2a+1)x + a^2 = 0$ has two integer solutions, then $$x = \\frac{-2a-1 \\pm \\sqrt{(2a+1)^2 - 4a^2}}{2}$$is an integer, so it follows that the discriminant $(2a+1)^2 - 4a^2 = 4a + 1$ must be a perfect square. Also, $1 \\le a \\le 50$, so it follows that $5 \\le 4a+1 \\le 201$. Clearly $4a+1$ can only be the square of an odd integer; conversely, the square of any odd integer $(2n+1)^2$ is of the form $4n^2 + 4n+1 = 4(n^2 + n) + 1$ and so can be written as $4a+1$. The odd perfect squares from $5$ to $201$ are given by $9 = 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, 9^2, 11^2, 169 = 13^2$, so it follows that there are $\\boxed{6}$ such values of $a$."
