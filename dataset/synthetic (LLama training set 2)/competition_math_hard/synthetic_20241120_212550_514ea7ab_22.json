    "working_out": "Certainly! Let's tackle this problem step by step, simulating a genuine human thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflecting, and checking our work along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nAlright, we have a right triangle with integer side lengths, and the hypotenuse is 39 units long. We need to find the length of the shorter leg. \n\nImmediately, I recall the Pythagorean Theorem:  \n\\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\]  \nwhere \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the other two sides.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** Plug in \\( c = 39 \\) and solve for the shorter leg.\n2. **List Pythagorean Triples:** Recall common Pythagorean triples to see if one fits.\n3. **Factor and Check:** Factor 39 and see if it relates to known triples or can simplify the problem.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n- **Strategy 1:** Directly apply the Pythagorean Theorem.\n- **Strategy 2:** Recall familiar Pythagorean triples.\n- **Strategy 3:** Consider 39\u2019s prime factors to see if it aligns with any known triples.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying Strategy 1: Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Step 1:**  \nLet\u2019s assign variables:  \n- \\( a \\): Shorter leg (what we need to find)\n- \\( b \\): Longer leg\n- \\( c = 39 \\): Hypotenuse\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean Theorem:  \n\\[ a^2 + b^2 = 39^2 = 1521 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBut wait, we have two variables here. We need another equation or relationship to solve for \\( a \\).\n\n**Realization:**  \nIn right triangles with integer sides (Pythagorean triples), often one leg is shorter, so \\( a \\leq b \\). Let's focus on finding \\( a \\) first.\n\n**Wait a Moment:**  \nThis approach seems too open-ended. Maybe listing possible values for \\( a \\) would help.\n\n---\n\n### **Trying Strategy 2: Listing Pythagorean Triples**\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nI remember some basic Pythagorean triples like (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), but none with a hypotenuse of 39 off the top of my head. Perhaps scaling these might work.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nScaling known triples might lead us to the right answer. Let\u2019s see.\n\n**Scaling Known Triples:**  \n- **(3, 4, 5) scaled by 39/5:**  \n  \\[ \\text{Scale factor} = \\frac{39}{5} = 7.8 \\]  \n  \\[ 3 \\times 7.8 = 23.4,\\ 4 \\times 7.8 = 31.2,\\ 5 \\times 7.8 = 39 \\]  \n  But sides need to be integers. So, this doesn\u2019t work.\n\n**Realization:**  \nScaling only works if the scale factor is an integer. Since 39 divided by 5 is not an integer, this path isn't helpful.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nStrategy 2 is not leading us anywhere since 39 doesn\u2019t easily relate to basic triples through integer scaling.\n\n---\n\n### **Switching to Strategy 3: Prime Factorization of 39**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nLet\u2019s factor 39 to see if it\u2019s part of a more complex triple.\n\n\\[ 39 = 3 \\times 13 \\]\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nMaybe there are Pythagorean triples where the hypotenuse is the product of primes like 3 and 13.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHowever, I don\u2019t recall specific triples involving 39 directly. Perhaps there\u2019s a better way.\n\n**Wait a Minute:**  \nThis approach is too abstract. Let\u2019s try something more straightforward: using the Pythagorean theorem to find possible integer values for \\( a \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting Strategy 1: Solving for \\( a \\) Using Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Step 1:**  \nRearrange the equation to solve for \\( a^2 \\):  \n\\[ a^2 = 1521 - b^2 \\]\n\n**Step 2:**  \nSince \\( a \\leq b \\), and both are integers, we can iterate over possible integer values for \\( b \\) and check if \\( a^2 \\) is a perfect square.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nPerhaps starting from the largest possible \\( b \\) and moving down would be efficient.\n\n**Checking Values:**\n\n- **Let\u2019s start with \\( b = 38 \\):**  \n  \\[ a^2 = 1521 - 38^2 = 1521 - 1444 = 77 \\]  \n  \\[ \\sqrt{77} \\approx 8.77 \\] (Not an integer)\n\n- **Try \\( b = 37 \\):**  \n  \\[ a^2 = 1521 - 37^2 = 1521 - 1369 = 152 \\]  \n  \\[ \\sqrt{152} \\approx 12.33 \\] (Not an integer)\n\n- **Continue this process\u2026**\n\n**Realization:**  \nThis could take a while manually. Is there a shortcut or a known method to find integer solutions more efficiently?\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Alternative Strategy: Generating Pythagorean Triples**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nMaybe using formulas to generate Pythagorean triples could help. There\u2019s a method using two integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) where:\n\n\\[ a = m^2 - n^2 \\]  \n\\[ b = 2mn \\]  \n\\[ c = m^2 + n^2 \\]  \n\nGiven \\( c = 39 \\), we can solve for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems promising. Let\u2019s proceed.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nSet up the equation:  \n\\[ m^2 + n^2 = 39 \\]\n\n**But Wait:**  \nCan \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) be integers such that their squares add up to 39?\n\n- **Check \\( m = 5, n = 4 \\):**  \n  \\[ 5^2 + 4^2 = 25 + 16 = 41 \\] (Too large)\n\n- **Check \\( m = 4, n = 3 \\):**  \n  \\[ 4^2 + 3^2 = 16 + 9 = 25 \\] (< 39)\n\n**Realization:**  \nNo integer values of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) satisfy \\( m^2 + n^2 = 39 \\). Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\n**Wait a Moment:**  \nPerhaps I misapplied the formula. Or maybe, since 39 is odd, different formulas are required.\n\n---\n\n### **Returning to Strategy 1: Systematic Search for \\( b \\)**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nLet\u2019s persist with the original strategy but streamline it by narrowing the possible values for \\( b \\).\n\n**Step 1:**  \nGiven \\( a \\leq b \\) and \\( a^2 + b^2 = 1521 \\), let\u2019s test plausible \\( b \\) values starting from half of 39 (since \\( b \\) can\u2019t exceed \\( c \\)).\n\n**Step 2:**  \nCalculate \\( a^2 \\) for each \\( b \\) and check if \\( a \\) is an integer.\n\n- **Try \\( b = 36 \\):**  \n  \\[ a^2 = 1521 - 36^2 = 1521 - 1296 = 225 \\]  \n  \\[ a = \\sqrt{225} = 15 \\] (Perfect square!)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAha! This works. So, \\( a = 15 \\) and \\( b = 36 \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet\u2019s verify:  \n\\[ 15^2 + 36^2 = 225 + 1296 = 1521 = 39^2 \\]  \nIt checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n**After Checking:**\nThe length of the shorter leg is **15 units**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy systematically testing possible values for the longer leg and applying the Pythagorean theorem, we successfully found that the shorter leg measures 15 units.\n\n**Reflection on the Process:**\nInitially, trying to recall or scale known Pythagorean triples didn't yield results. Factoring the hypotenuse also didn't provide immediate insights. Ultimately, a systematic approach of testing integer values for the longer leg led us to the solution. It\u2019s a reminder that sometimes straightforward, albeit methodical, strategies are the most effective.\n\n**Alternative Strategies Considered:**\n- Scaling known Pythagorean triples\n- Generating triples using \\( m \\) and \\( n \\)\n- Factoring the hypotenuse\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\nBeing open to adjusting strategies and verifying each step ensures accuracy, especially when initial methods don't immediately work.\n\n---",
