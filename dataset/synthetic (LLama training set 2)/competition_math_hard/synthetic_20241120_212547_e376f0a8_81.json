    "working_out": "**Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem step by step. The goal is to find an integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq n < 31 \\) and \\( 3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\). Once we have \\( n \\), we need to compute \\( \\left(2^n\\right)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\) and express the final answer as an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive.\n\n**First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, this looks like a problem involving modular arithmetic. The first part requires finding \\( n \\) such that multiplying it by 3 yields a remainder of 1 when divided by 31. It seems like we're looking for the modular inverse of 3 modulo 31. Once we find \\( n \\), we'll raise 2 to the power of \\( n \\), cube it, subtract 2, and then take the result modulo 31.\n\nBut wait, dealing with large exponents can get tricky, especially under modulo operations. I might need to use properties of exponents to simplify the calculations.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Finding \\( n \\):** I could try to find \\( n \\) by guessing and checking small values, but that might be inefficient. Alternatively, I can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse.\n\n2. **Calculating \\( \\left(2^n\\right)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\):** Once I have \\( n \\), I can compute \\( 2^n \\) modulo 31, cube the result, subtract 2, and then take modulo 31 again. But \\( n \\) might be large, so perhaps using exponentiation by squaring or Fermat's Little Theorem could help simplify the computation.\n\n**Step 1: Finding \\( n \\) Such That \\( 3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\)**\n\nLet's focus on finding \\( n \\) first. We need to solve the congruence \\( 3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\), which means finding the modular inverse of 3 modulo 31.\n\n**Approach: Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**\n\nThe Extended Euclidean Algorithm is a systematic way to find the modular inverse. Let's apply it here.\n\n1. **Perform the Euclidean Algorithm to Find GCD:**\n   - \\( 31 = 3 \\times 10 + 1 \\)\n   - \\( 3 = 1 \\times 3 + 0 \\)\n\n   The remainder becomes 0 after the second step, and the last non-zero remainder is 1, which is the gcd. Since gcd(31, 3) = 1, the modular inverse exists.\n\n2. **Back-substitute to Express 1 as a Linear Combination:**\n   - From the first step: \\( 1 = 31 - 3 \\times 10 \\)\n   - So, \\( 1 = 31 - 3 \\times 10 \\)\n\n   This equation tells us that \\( 3 \\times (-10) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\).\n\n3. **Find \\( n \\) Within the Desired Range:**\n   - We found that \\( n = -10 \\). However, we need \\( 0 \\leq n < 31 \\).\n   - To adjust \\( n \\), add 31 to -10: \\( n = -10 + 31 = 21 \\).\n\n    **Reflection:** Okay, so \\( n = 21 \\) satisfies \\( 3 \\times 21 = 63 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\). That checks out.\n\n**Step 2: Calculating \\( \\left(2^n\\right)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\)**\n\nNow that we have \\( n = 21 \\), we need to compute \\( \\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\).\n\n**Simplifying the Expression:**\n\nFirst, notice that \\( \\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 = 2^{63} \\). So, the expression becomes \\( 2^{63} - 2 \\pmod{31} \\).\n\n**Approach: Using Fermat's Little Theorem**\n\nFermat's Little Theorem states that if \\( p \\) is a prime and \\( a \\) is an integer not divisible by \\( p \\), then \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\). Here, \\( p = 31 \\) and \\( a = 2 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n2^{30} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}\n\\]\n\n**Applying Fermat's Little Theorem:**\n\nWe need \\( 2^{63} \\), which can be broken down as:\n\n\\[\n2^{63} = 2^{60} \\times 2^3\n\\]\n\nBut \\( 2^{60} = (2^{30})^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\).\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n2^{63} \\equiv 2^3 \\pmod{31}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\( 2^3 \\):**\n\n\\[\n2^3 = 8\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Back into the Original Expression:**\n\n\\[\n2^{63} - 2 \\equiv 8 - 2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{31}\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Calculation:**\n\nLet me double-check this to ensure everything's correct.\n\n1. **Using Fermat's Little Theorem:**\n   - \\( 2^{30} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\)\n   - \\( 2^{60} = (2^{30})^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\)\n   - \\( 2^{63} = 2^{60} \\times 2^3 \\equiv 1 \\times 8 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{31} \\)\n\n2. **Final Calculation:**\n   - \\( 2^{63} - 2 \\equiv 8 - 2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{31} \\)\n\nThis seems correct.\n\n**Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\nJust to be sure, let's think if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\n1. **Alternative Method for Finding \\( n \\):** Instead of using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, I could have tried modular exponentiation or used a calculator that supports modular inverses. However, the algorithm is straightforward and reliable.\n\n2. **Alternative Method for Calculating \\( 2^{63} \\):** I could have used repeated squaring to compute \\( 2^{21} \\) and then cubed it, but Fermat's Little Theorem provides a much cleaner solution by reducing the exponent modulo 30.\n\n**Final Reflection**\n\nUsing Fermat's Little Theorem significantly simplifies the calculation of large exponents modulo a prime. By reducing \\( 2^{63} \\) to \\( 2^3 \\), the computation becomes straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully working through each step and verifying the calculations, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
