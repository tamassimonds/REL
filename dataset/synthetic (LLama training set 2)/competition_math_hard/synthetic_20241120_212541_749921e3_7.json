    "working_out": "Certainly! Let's tackle this problem step by step, embracing the natural thought process, including brainstorming, checking for correctness, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, we need to find the number of factors of \\( x^2 y^3 z^4 \\), where \\( x, y, \\) and \\( z \\) are distinct natural numbers, each having exactly three natural-number factors. \n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n- **Recall:** A number with exactly three factors is intriguing. I vaguely remember that only prime squares have exactly three factors. Let me think about why that is...\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Determine the Nature of \\( x, y, z \\):** Confirm what kinds of numbers they must be.\n  2. **Express \\( x^2 y^3 z^4 \\) in Terms of Primes:** This might help in finding the total number of factors.\n  3. **Apply the Formula for Counting Factors:** I know there's a formula involving exponents of prime factors.\n\n**Reflection:** It seems logical to first confirm the properties of \\( x, y, \\) and \\( z \\) before proceeding. Understanding their nature will guide the rest of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Numbers with Exactly Three Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- If a number \\( n \\) has exactly three factors, they must be: 1, \\( n \\), and one other factor. This implies \\( n \\) must be the square of a prime.\n- **Why?**  \n  - If \\( n = p^2 \\) (where \\( p \\) is a prime), its factors are:  \n    - \\( 1 \\) (since \\( 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\)),  \n    - \\( p \\) (since \\( p \\times 1 = p \\)),  \n    - \\( p^2 \\) (since \\( p \\times p = p^2 \\)).  \n  - Total: 3 factors.\n\n**Check:**  \n- **Alternative Possibility:** Could there be any other form of \\( n \\) with exactly three factors?  \n  - If \\( n \\) were the product of different primes or higher powers, the number of factors would increase.  \n  - **Conclusion:** Only perfect squares of primes have exactly three factors.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Each of \\( x, y, z \\) must be the square of a distinct prime.**  \n  - Let's denote:  \n    - \\( x = p^2 \\)  \n    - \\( y = q^2 \\)  \n    - \\( z = r^2 \\)  \n  - Where \\( p, q, r \\) are distinct primes.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Confidence Level:** High.  \n  - The logic aligns with the properties of factors.  \n- **Next Step:** Use this information to express \\( x^2 y^3 z^4 \\) in terms of prime factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing \\( x^2 y^3 z^4 \\) in Terms of Primes**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Given:**  \n  - \\( x = p^2 \\)  \n  - \\( y = q^2 \\)  \n  - \\( z = r^2 \\)  \n- **Need to Find:**  \n  - \\( x^2 y^3 z^4 \\)  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n- Let's compute each exponent:  \n  - \\( x^2 = (p^2)^2 = p^{4} \\)  \n  - \\( y^3 = (q^2)^3 = q^{6} \\)  \n  - \\( z^4 = (r^2)^4 = r^{8} \\)  \n\n- **Multiplying Together:**  \n  \\[ x^2 y^3 z^4 = p^{4} \\cdot q^{6} \\cdot r^{8} \\]\n\n**Check:**  \n- **Exponents Calculation:**  \n  - \\( (p^2)^2 = p^{4} \\): Yes, correct.  \n  - \\( (q^2)^3 = q^{6} \\): Yes, correct.  \n  - \\( (r^2)^4 = r^{8} \\): Yes, correct.  \n- **Multiplication:**  \n  - Combining distinct primes raised to respective powers seems correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Confidence Level:** High.  \n  - The exponents are calculated correctly.  \n- **Next Step:** Use the factorization to determine the total number of factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Formula for Counting Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Recalling the Formula:**  \n  - If a number is expressed as \\( n = p^{a} \\cdot q^{b} \\cdot r^{c} \\),  \n  - Then the total number of factors is \\( (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) \\).  \n  - **Why?**  \n    - Each exponent contributes by allowing factors that include the prime raised from \\( 0 \\) up to its exponent.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- **Given:**  \n  - \\( n = p^{4} \\cdot q^{6} \\cdot r^{8} \\)  \n- **Applying the Formula:**  \n  \\[ \\text{Number of factors} = (4 + 1)(6 + 1)(8 + 1) \\]  \n  \\[ = 5 \\times 7 \\times 9 \\]\n\n- **Performing Multiplication:**  \n  \\[ 5 \\times 7 = 35 \\]  \n  \\[ 35 \\times 9 = 315 \\]\n\n**Check:**  \n- **Multiplication Verification:**  \n  - \\( 5 \\times 7 = 35 \\): Correct.  \n  - \\( 35 \\times 9 = 315 \\): Let's double-check.  \n    - \\( 35 \\times 9 = 35 \\times (10 - 1) = 350 - 35 = 315 \\): Yes, correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Confidence Level:** High.  \n  - The formula is applied correctly, and the multiplication checks out.  \n- **Final Answer:**  \n  - **The number \\( x^2 y^3 z^4 \\) has 315 factors.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?**  \n  - Given that \\( x, y, z \\) are squares of distinct primes, raising their exponents in \\( x^2 y^3 z^4 \\) results in higher powers, which naturally increase the number of factors.  \n  - The computation steps align with mathematical principles.\n\n**Alternative Strategy Check:**  \n- **Is There Another Way to Verify?**  \n  - **Listing Factors:**  \n    - Listing out factors manually isn't feasible due to the large number.  \n  - **Simplification:**  \n    - No simpler method comes to mind that would contradict the current approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Confidence in the Solution:**  \n  - The step-by-step approach confirms the correctness.  \n  - Multiple checks validate each part of the process.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n- **\\( x^2 y^3 z^4 \\) has 315 factors.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy first identifying that \\( x, y, \\) and \\( z \\) must be squares of distinct primes, we expressed \\( x^2 y^3 z^4 \\) in terms of its prime factors. Applying the formula for counting factors based on prime exponents led us to the correct number of factors: 315. Throughout the process, consistent checking ensured the accuracy of each step.",

  "ground_truth": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors."
