  "problem": "The graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ has the following properties: (1) The maximum value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is 5, which occurs at $x = 3$. (2) The graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$. If the graph passes through the point $(4,m)$, then what is the value of $m$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, checking each one as I go, and reflecting often to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's see how it unfolds.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- We have a quadratic equation \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) with specific properties:\n  1. **Maximum value is 5 at \\( x = 3 \\).**\n  2. **The graph passes through \\( (0, -13) \\).**\n  3. **We need to find \\( m \\) at \\( x = 4 \\).**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of vertex form and using points to find coefficients. But I'm not entirely sure which method is best right off the bat. Maybe I'll explore a few strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Vertex Form:** Since there's a maximum, converting to vertex form \\( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \\) might be helpful.\n\n2. **Find Derivatives:** Calculating where the derivative equals zero could confirm the maximum point.\n\n3. **Set Up Equations:** Use the given points to create a system of equations to solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Vertex Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Given that the maximum occurs at \\( x = 3 \\) with a value of 5, the vertex is \\( (3, 5) \\). So, rewriting the quadratic in vertex form could simplify things.\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n\n\\[\ny = a(x - 3)^2 + 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This seems straightforward. By expanding this, I can relate it back to the standard form and use the other given point to find \\( a \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 1**\n\n**Expanding Vertex Form:**\n\n\\[\ny = a(x^2 - 6x + 9) + 5 = ax^2 - 6ax + 9a + 5\n\\]\n\n**Comparing to Standard Form:**\n\n\\[\ny = ax^2 + bx + c\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nb = -6a,\\quad c = 9a + 5\n\\]\n\n**Using Given Point \\( (0, -13) \\):**\n\n\\[\n-13 = 0 + 0 + c \\implies c = -13\n\\]\n\n**Checking Consistency:**\n\n\\[\n9a + 5 = -13 \\implies 9a = -18 \\implies a = -2\n\\]\n\n**Finding \\( b \\):**\n\n\\[\nb = -6a = -6(-2) = 12\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does this make sense?\n  - With \\( a = -2 \\), the parabola opens downwards, which aligns with having a maximum point.\n  - \\( c = -13 \\) matches the y-intercept given.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** So far, so good.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy Consideration**\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\n\n- What if I approached this by setting up a system of equations from the start using all given points? Let's briefly explore to ensure the initial strategy is correct.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 2: System of Equations**\n\n- **Setting Up Equations:**\n  - From the maximum point: Derivative zero at \\( x = 3 \\).\n  - From the point \\( (0, -13) \\).\n  - From the vertex information.\n\n- **But Actually:** This seems like it would lead to the same conclusions, possibly adding unnecessary complexity. Strategy 1 appears more straightforward.\n\n**Decision:** Stick with Strategy 1 since it\u2019s leading to correct and consistent results.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying Strategy 1 to Find \\( m \\) at \\( x = 4 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have \\( a = -2 \\), \\( b = 12 \\), and \\( c = -13 \\), I can plug \\( x = 4 \\) into the quadratic to find \\( m \\).\n\n**Calculating \\( y \\) at \\( x = 4 \\):**\n\n\\[\ny = -2(4)^2 + 12(4) - 13\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = -2(16) + 48 - 13\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = -32 + 48 - 13 = 16 - 13 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does this value make sense?\n  - The maximum value is 5 at \\( x = 3 \\), so at \\( x = 4 \\), being close to the vertex, a value of 3 seems reasonable.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** The calculation appears correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Recap:**\n\n- Maximum at \\( x = 3 \\): Confirmed by vertex form.\n- Passes through \\( (0, -13) \\): Coefficients match.\n- Calculated \\( m = 3 \\) at \\( x = 4 \\): Consistent with the parabola's behavior.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Everything aligns well with the given properties. No discrepancies found.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>  \n3  \nsolution  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Step-by-Step Recap:**\n  1. **Brainstormed multiple strategies**, decided that using vertex form was the most straightforward.\n  2. **Converted the quadratic to vertex form**, determined coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) using the given points.\n  3. **Validated coefficients** by checking consistency with given properties.\n  4. **Calculated \\( m \\) at \\( x = 4 \\)** using the determined quadratic equation.\n  5. **Performed quick checks** at each step to ensure correctness.\n\n- **Final Check:** All calculations and properties align, confirming that \\( m = 3 \\) is the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>  \n3  \nsolution  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step approach provides a clear understanding of how to tackle the problem, reflecting real human thinking and checking processes along the way.

  "ground_truth": "Since the maximum value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is 5, which occurs at $x = 3$, this tells us that the vertex of the parabola is $(3,5)$.  Hence, the quadratic is of the form $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, where $a$ is a negative number.  (We know that $a$ is negative because $y$ has a maximum value.)\n\nWe are also told that the graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$.  Substituting these coordinates into the equation $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, we get $-13 = 9a + 5$, so $a = (-5 - 13)/9 = -18/9 = -2$.  Therefore, the equation is $y =- 2(x - 3)^2+5$.\n\nWhen $x = 4$, we have $m = - 2 \\cdot 1^2 + 5 = \\boxed{3}$."
