  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process as if I were solving it on paper, exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and making adjustments as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem asks for the remainder of \\(19^{1999}\\) divided by 25. Immediately, I'm thinking this involves modular arithmetic because we're dealing with remainders. I recall learning about **Euler\u2019s Theorem** and **Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem**, which might be helpful here. But honestly, exponentiating such a large number directly seems impractical, so I definitely need a clever approach.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n- **Euler\u2019s Theorem:** Wait, this deals with finding powers modulo \\(n\\), which seems relevant.\n- **Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem:** Maybe this could simplify the exponent?\n- **Pattern Observation:** Perhaps spotting a pattern in smaller powers could help.\n- **Chinese Remainder Theorem:** Not sure if it's applicable, but could be worth considering.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which method will work best, so I'll explore them one by one.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Euler\u2019s Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nEuler\u2019s Theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then:\n\n\\[\na^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\phi(n)\\) is Euler's totient function. Here, \\(a = 19\\) and \\(n = 25\\), and they are coprime.\n\n**Calculations:**\nFirst, I need to find \\(\\phi(25)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\phi(25) = 25 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 25 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, according to Euler's Theorem:\n\n\\[\n19^{20} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}\n\\]\n\n**Applying This to Our Problem:**\nI can write \\(19^{1999}\\) as:\n\n\\[\n19^{1999} = 19^{20 \\times 99 + 19} = (19^{20})^{99} \\times 19^{19}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(19^{20} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}\\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(1)^{99} \\times 19^{19} \\equiv 19^{19} \\pmod{25}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, so now I need to find \\(19^{19} \\mod 25\\). This still seems like a big exponent, so maybe I need to break it down further. Let's see if I can simplify it more.\n\n---\n\n### **Breaking Down \\(19^{19} \\mod 25\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nInstead of calculating \\(19^{19}\\) directly, perhaps I can use repeated squaring or look for patterns in smaller powers of 19 modulo 25.\n\n**Calculations:**\nLet\u2019s compute the first few powers of 19 modulo 25 to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n\\[\n19^1 \\equiv 19 \\pmod{25}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n19^2 = 361 \\equiv 361 - 14 \\times 25 = 11 \\pmod{25}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n19^3 = 19 \\times 11 = 209 \\equiv 209 - 8 \\times 25 = 9 \\pmod{25}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n19^4 = 19 \\times 9 = 171 \\equiv 171 - 6 \\times 25 = 21 \\pmod{25}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n19^5 = 19 \\times 21 = 399 \\equiv 399 - 15 \\times 25 = 24 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25}\n\\]\n\n**Observation:**\nOh, interesting! \\(19^5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25}\\). This is a useful pattern because raising \\(-1\\) to an odd power gives \\(-1\\), and to an even power gives 1.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis pattern can significantly simplify our calculations. Let\u2019s see how we can use it.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying the Pattern**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince \\(19^5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25}\\), I can express \\(19^{19}\\) in terms of \\(19^5\\).\n\n\\[\n19^{19} = (19^5)^3 \\times 19^4\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\nFrom earlier, we know:\n\n\\[\n19^5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n19^4 \\equiv 21 \\pmod{25}\n\\]\n\nNow, compute \\(19^{19}\\):\n\n\\[\n(19^5)^3 \\times 19^4 \\equiv (-1)^3 \\times 21 \\equiv -1 \\times 21 \\equiv -21 \\pmod{25}\n\\]\n\nTo convert \\(-21\\) to a positive remainder:\n\n\\[\n-21 + 25 = 4 \\pmod{25}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nGreat! So, \\(19^{19} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{25}\\). This means that \\(19^{1999} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{25}\\) as well.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing the answer, I want to make sure everything makes sense. Let\u2019s recap the steps to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\n1. **Applied Euler\u2019s Theorem:** Simplified \\(19^{1999}\\) to \\(19^{19} \\mod 25\\).\n2. **Found a Pattern:** Discovered that \\(19^5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25}\\).\n3. **Simplified \\(19^{19}\\):** Used the pattern to compute \\(19^{19} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{25}\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\nAll the calculations align, and the pattern holds true. No errors spotted.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]  \nsolution</ANSWER>\n\nThe remainder of \\(19^{1999}\\) divided by 25 is **4**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, identifying patterns, and validating each step, I arrived at the correct remainder. Starting with Euler\u2019s Theorem and then leveraging the observed pattern in powers of 19 made the problem manageable. Always reflecting and checking along the way ensured accuracy.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",
  "ground_truth": "Let us investigate the first few powers of 19: \\begin{align*}\n19^1 &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^2 &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^3 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^4 &\\equiv 21 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^5 &\\equiv 24 \\pmod{25}.\n\\end{align*} At this point, we see that $19^5 \\equiv 24 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25},$ hence $19^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}.$ That means that $19^{1999} = 19^9 \\cdot (19^{10})^{199} \\equiv 19^9 \\pmod {25}.$\n\nSince $19^4 \\equiv 21 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{25}$ and $19^5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25},$ then $19^{1999} \\equiv 19^9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{25},$ hence our desired remainder is $\\boxed{4}.$"
