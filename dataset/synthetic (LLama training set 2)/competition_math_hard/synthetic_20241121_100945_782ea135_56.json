  "problem": "If $n = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^{14} \\cdot 5^{8}$, how many of the natural-number factors of $n$ are multiples of 150?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect along the way, and check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n\n- **Wait, what am I being asked?** I need to find how many natural-number factors of \\( n = 2^{10} \\times 3^{14} \\times 5^8 \\) are multiples of 150.\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving factors and multiples. Maybe I'll need to use prime factorization or something similar.\n- **But I'm not entirely sure how to start...** Let me brainstorm a bit.\n\nBrainstorming:\n\n- **What do I know about factors?** Factors of a number are integers that divide it without leaving a remainder.\n- **And multiples of 150?** So, the factors I'm looking for must also be multiples of 150.\n- **Hmm...** It seems like I need to find factors of \\( n \\) that include 150 as a factor.\n\nExploring Strategies:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Approach:** Break down 150 into its prime factors and see how it relates to \\( n \\).\n2. **Counting Factors Method:** Use formulas to count factors of \\( n \\) that meet certain criteria.\n3. **List Factors Explicitly:** But that might be too time-consuming given the size of \\( n \\).\n\n**Let me try the Prime Factorization Approach first.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization of 150**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- **If factors must be multiples of 150,** then 150's prime factors must be present in those factors.\n- **Let's break down 150** to see its prime components.\n\nCalculation:\n\n\\[\n150 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2\n\\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, because \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\), and \\( 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\).\n- **So, any factor of \\( n \\) that's a multiple of 150** must include at least these prime factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing \\( n \\)'s Prime Factors**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- **Given \\( n = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^{14} \\cdot 5^8 \\),** I have more than enough of each prime factor.\n- **This is good because** it means \\( n \\) is divisible by 150 multiple times.\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Wait, is there a limit to how many times 150 can fit into \\( n \\)?** Yes, based on the exponents of the prime factors.\n- **I think I need to determine how many combinations of the exponents** include at least what's needed to make 150.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up the Problem**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- **I need factors of \\( n \\) that include \\( 2^1 \\), \\( 3^1 \\), and \\( 5^2 \\).**\n- **That means** I need to count all factors of \\( n \\) that have at least these exponents.\n\nBrainstorming:\n\n- **Could I use the formula for the number of factors?** Yes, but I need to adjust it to account for the multiples of 150.\n- **Maybe I can calculate the total number of factors first** and then determine how many meet the criteria.\n\n**Let me try calculating the total number of factors of \\( n \\) first.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating Total Number of Factors of \\( n \\)**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- **The total number of factors is found by** adding 1 to each of the exponents and multiplying them together.\n- **So, for \\( n \\):**\n\n\\[\n(10 + 1) \\times (14 + 1) \\times (8 + 1) = 11 \\times 15 \\times 9\n\\]\n\nCalculation:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 15 = 165 \\\\\n165 \\times 9 = 1485\n\\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- **That seems like a lot of factors,** but given the large exponents, it makes sense.\n- **Okay, so \\( n \\) has 1485 factors.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determining Factors That Are Multiples of 150**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- **I need to count only those factors that include \\( 2^1 \\), \\( 3^1 \\), and \\( 5^2 \\).**\n- **Essentially, I'm looking for factors of \\( n \\) that are divisible by 150.**\n\nBrainstorming:\n\n- **Perhaps I can adjust the exponents accordingly:** \n  - For \\( 2 \\), exponents can be from 1 to 10.\n  - For \\( 3 \\), exponents can be from 1 to 14.\n  - For \\( 5 \\), exponents must be at least 2, so from 2 to 8.\n\n**This sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can set it up like this:**\n\n- **Number of valid exponents for each prime:**\n  - \\( 2: 10 \\) choices (from 1 to 10)\n  - \\( 3: 14 \\) choices (from 1 to 14)\n  - \\( 5: 7 \\) choices (from 2 to 8)\n\nCalculation:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 14 \\times 7 = 980\n\\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Hmm, let me double-check that logic.**\n- **Does it make sense to multiply these numbers?** Yes, because each combination of exponents represents a unique factor.\n- **So, there are 980 factors of \\( n \\) that are multiples of 150.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Approach**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- **Does this answer seem reasonable?** Given the large number of total factors, having 980 multiples of 150 seems plausible.\n- **But wait, did I account for all necessary conditions?** Yes, by ensuring that the exponents meet the minimum requirements set by 150's prime factors.\n\nQuick Check:\n\n- **Total factors: 1485**\n- **Factors that are multiples of 150: 980**\n- **Seemingly, about two-thirds of the factors are multiples of 150,** which feels reasonable given the exponents.\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Okay, I think this approach works.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{980}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **By breaking down 150 into its prime factors** and ensuring that the factors of \\( n \\) included those primes to the necessary exponents, I was able to determine that there are 980 factors of \\( n \\) that are multiples of 150.\n- **Throughout the process, I brainstormed different strategies,** checked my calculations, and reflected on whether the approach made sense, adjusting as needed.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\n- **This method was effective,** and by thinking through each step carefully, I arrived at the correct answer.",
  "ground_truth": "$150=2^13^15^2$.  Thus the coefficient of $2$ must be between $1$ and $10$, the coefficient of $3$ must be between $1$ and $14$, and the coefficient of $5$ must be between $2$ and $8$.  So the number of possible factors is\n\n$$(10)(14)(7)=\\boxed{980}$$"
