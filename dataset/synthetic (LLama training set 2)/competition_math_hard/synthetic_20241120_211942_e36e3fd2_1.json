    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all eight-digit integers formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer. Examples given are 25,632,563 and 60,786,078.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Repeating a four-digit number to make an eight-digit number suggests a specific numerical pattern.\n- The GCD is a number that divides all such eight-digit numbers without leaving a remainder.\n- I recall that problems involving repeating digits often relate to factors of numbers like 9 or 11, but I'm not entirely sure yet.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Express the Eight-Digit Number Algebraically:**\n   - Maybe I can represent the number in terms of the original four-digit number and see what factors emerge.\n\n2. **Look for Common Factors:**\n   - Identify what common factors exist in all such numbers by examining specific examples.\n\n3. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Determine the prime factors of a sample number to see if there's a pattern.\n\n4. **Use Modular Arithmetic:**\n   - Perhaps checking congruences could reveal common divisibility properties.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Expressing the number algebraically seems like a solid starting point. It often helps to generalize the problem.\n\n### **Attempting the First Strategy: Algebraic Expression**\n\nLet's denote the original four-digit integer as \\( n \\). When repeated, the eight-digit integer becomes \\( nn \\), where \\( n \\) is repeated.\n\n**Express \\( nn \\) Numerically:**\n- The number \\( nn \\) can be seen as \\( n \\times 10,000 + n \\).\n- So, \\( nn = n \\times 10,000 + n = n \\times (10,000 + 1) = n \\times 10,001 \\).\n\n**Aha Moment:**\n- Wait! This means every such eight-digit number is \\( n \\times 10,001 \\).\n- Therefore, all these numbers are multiples of 10,001.\n\n**Immediate Insight:**\n- If all numbers are multiples of 10,001, then 10,001 must be a common divisor.\n- But is it the greatest common divisor? Let's explore further.\n\n### **Exploring Other Strategies to Confirm**\n\n**Strategy 2: Examining Specific Examples**\n\nLet's take specific four-digit numbers and see how their eight-digit counterparts behave with respect to 10,001.\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Let \\( n = 1234 \\).\n- Then, the eight-digit number \\( nn = 12,341,234 \\).\n- Check divisibility: \\( 12,341,234 \\div 10,001 = 1,234 \\) (no remainder).\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Let \\( n = 5678 \\).\n- Then, \\( nn = 56,785,678 \\).\n- Check divisibility: \\( 56,785,678 \\div 10,001 = 5,678 \\) (no remainder).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both examples confirm that 10,001 divides the eight-digit number without a remainder.\n- This consistency across different \\( n \\) values suggests that 10,001 is indeed a common divisor.\n\n**Strategy 3: Prime Factorization of 10,001**\n\nTo ensure that 10,001 is the greatest common divisor, let's factorize it.\n\n**Factoring 10,001:**\n- At first glance, 10,001 doesn't seem divisible by small primes like 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Let me try dividing by 11: \\( 10,001 \\div 11 = 909.1818 \\) (not an integer).\n- Hmm, maybe it's divisible by larger primes.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Wait, I remember that 10,001 is \\( 10^4 + 1 \\).\n- There's a factorization formula: \\( 10^4 + 1 = (10^2 + 1)(10^2 - 10 + 1)(10^2 + 10 + 1) \\).\n  \n**Calculations:**\n- \\( 10^2 + 1 = 101 \\)\n- \\( 10^2 - 10 + 1 = 91 \\), which factors into \\( 7 \\times 13 \\)\n- \\( 10^2 + 10 + 1 = 111 \\), which factors into \\( 3 \\times 37 \\)\n\n**Final Factorization:**\n- \\( 10,001 = 101 \\times 91 = 101 \\times 7 \\times 13 \\)\n\n**Checking for GCD:**\n- Since 10,001 factors into prime numbers, and every eight-digit number of the form \\( nn \\) is a multiple of 10,001, there are no larger common divisors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The greatest common divisor of all such eight-digit numbers is indeed 10,001.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy expressing the eight-digit number as \\( n \\times 10,001 \\), examining specific examples, and confirming through prime factorization, we've consistently found that 10,001 is the greatest common divisor.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{10,001}\n\\]\n\n**Learning Points:**\n- **Algebraic Representation:** Translating the problem into an algebraic form can reveal underlying patterns and factors.\n- **Verification with Examples:** Checking specific cases helps to confirm general findings and catch any potential errors in reasoning.\n- **Prime Factorization:** Understanding the factors of key numbers ensures the accuracy of the GCD determination.\n- **Flexibility in Approach:** Being open to shifting strategies\u2014starting with algebra, then testing examples, and finally verifying through factorization\u2014strengthens problem-solving effectiveness.",

  "ground_truth": "If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$. So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001. Consider $10001\\cdot1000$ and $10001\\cdot1001$. After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\\boxed{10001}$."
