  "problem": "In the prime factorization of $24!$, what is the exponent of $3$?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)",
  "solution": "Certainly! Let's take the original working out and refine it into a polished, coherent solution while preserving the authentic thought process. We'll maintain the exploratory nature, including brainstorming, reflections, and checks to ensure clarity and correctness. \n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. The question asks for the exponent of \\(3\\) in the prime factorization of \\(24!\\). \n\n- **First Thoughts:** Okay, so \\(24!\\) means multiplying all integers from \\(1\\) to \\(24\\). Prime factorization involves breaking down a number into its prime components. I remember doing similar problems before, where we needed to find how many times a prime number divides into a factorial.\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** I think I need to figure out how many times \\(3\\) is a factor in all those numbers multiplied together. But, wait, direct multiplication sounds tedious and impractical for such a large number. There must be a more efficient way.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **List Out Multiples of 3:** Count how many numbers up to \\(24\\) are divisible by \\(3\\).\n   \n2. **Use Legendre\u2019s (de Polignac\u2019s) Formula:** I vaguely recall a formula that calculates the exponent of a prime in a factorial.\n\n3. **Prime Factorization of Each Number up to \\(24\\):** Break down each number individually.\n\n- **Exploring Strategy 1:** Listing out multiples of \\(3\\). But, thinking more, this might miss higher powers of \\(3\\) (like \\(9\\), \\(3^2\\)), which contribute additional factors. So, not sufficient.\n\n- **Realizing Strategy 2 Might Be Better:** Maybe Legendre\u2019s Formula is the way to go since it accounts for higher powers of \\(3\\).\n\n### **Applying Legendre\u2019s Formula**\n\nLegendre\u2019s Formula states that for a prime \\(p\\) and a positive integer \\(n\\), the exponent of \\(p\\) in \\(n!\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Exponent of } p = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nuntil \\(p^k > n\\).\n\n- **Thought Process:** This formula makes sense because it counts not just the multiples of \\(p\\), but also the multiples of higher powers of \\(p\\) that contribute additional factors.\n\n- **Checking Understanding:** Yeah, this should work. It systematically counts all factors of \\(3\\) in \\(24!\\).\n\n### **Calculating Each Term Using Legendre\u2019s Formula**\n\nLet's apply the formula for \\(p = 3\\) and \\(n = 24\\).\n\n#### **First Term: \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{3} \\right\\rfloor\\)**\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{3} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 8 \\right\\rfloor = 8\n\\]\n\n- **Interpretation:** There are 8 numbers up to 24 that are divisible by \\(3\\).\n\n#### **Second Term: \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{3^2} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{9} \\right\\rfloor\\)**\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{9} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 2.666\\ldots \\right\\rfloor = 2\n\\]\n\n- **Interpretation:** There are 2 numbers up to 24 that are multiples of \\(9\\) (\\(3^2\\)), each contributing an extra factor of \\(3\\).\n\n#### **Third Term: \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{3^3} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{27} \\right\\rfloor\\)**\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{27} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 0.888\\ldots \\right\\rfloor = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Interpretation:** \\(27\\) is greater than \\(24\\), so there are no multiples of \\(27\\) within \\(24\\).\n\n#### **Higher Powers:**\n\n- **\\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{3^k} \\right\\rfloor = 0\\) for \\(k \\geq 4\\):**\n  \n  Since \\(3^4 = 81 > 24\\), all higher powers contribute zero.\n\n- **Thought Process:** Since \\(81 > 24\\), and higher powers of \\(3\\) are even larger, all subsequent terms will be zero.\n\n### **Summing the Terms**\n\nNow, let's add up the contributions from each term:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Exponent of } 3 = 8 + 2 + 0 = 10\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** So, according to Legendre\u2019s Formula, the exponent of \\(3\\) in \\(24!\\) is \\(10\\).\n\n### **Intermediate Check**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Let me think... There are \\(8\\) multiples of \\(3\\), and two of those are multiples of \\(9\\), which add extra factors. No multiples of higher powers of \\(3\\) exist within \\(24\\). Yeah, this seems correct.\n\n- **Quick Validation:** If I were to list multiples of \\(3\\): \\(3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24\\) \u2014 that\u2019s \\(8\\). Multiples of \\(9\\): \\(9, 18\\) \u2014 that\u2019s \\(2\\). No multiples of \\(27\\) or higher. Adds up to \\(10\\). Seems spot on.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Maybe break down each number\u2019s prime factors up to \\(24\\) and count the \\(3\\)s manually.\n\n- **But Wait:** That sounds time-consuming and prone to error. Legendre\u2019s Formula is specifically designed for this kind of problem, so it\u2019s likely the most efficient and reliable method.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Stick with Legendre\u2019s Formula as it provides a systematic approach.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Recalculate to Ensure Accuracy:** Let\u2019s briefly run through the calculations again to make sure no mistakes were made.\n\n  - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 8\\)\n  - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{9} \\right\\rfloor = 2\\)\n  - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{27} \\right\\rfloor = 0\\)\n\n- **Sum:** \\(8 + 2 + 0 = 10\\)\n\n- **Reflection:** Everything checks out. The calculations are consistent, and the reasoning aligns with the expected outcome.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>\nThe exponent of \\(3\\) in the prime factorization of \\(24!\\) is \\(10\\).\n</ANSWER>\n\n- **Final Thoughts:** By applying Legendre\u2019s Formula, we efficiently determined the exponent of \\(3\\) without manually factoring each number up to \\(24\\). This method ensured accuracy while saving time and effort.\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Identified the need to find the exponent of \\(3\\) in \\(24!\\).\n\n2. **Brainstorming Strategies:** Considered listing multiples, using a formula, and manual factorization.\n\n3. **Choosing the Best Strategy:** Selected Legendre\u2019s Formula as the most efficient method.\n\n4. **Applying the Formula:** Calculated each term to determine the total exponent.\n\n5. **Intermediate Checks:** Validated the calculations by cross-referencing with known multiples.\n\n6. **Final Verification:** Reconfirmed the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n7. **Conclusion:** Determined the exponent as \\(10\\), confidently confirming the solution.\n\n---\n\nBy thoughtfully exploring different strategies, selecting the most appropriate one, and continuously checking for correctness, we arrived at the correct exponent of \\(3\\) in \\(24!\\).",
  "ground_truth": "Of the numbers from $1$ to $24$, eight of them are multiples of $3$, so that gives us an exponent of $8$.\n\nNow, two of the numbers are multiples of $3^2=9$, so each of them has $3$ as a factor twice. We've already counted them one each, so we need to count them each one more time. This adds another $2$ to the exponent.\n\nThe next thing to check is whether any of the numbers have $3$ as a factor three times. Happily, $3^3=27>24$, so we don't have any of those.\n\nOur total exponent is $8+2=\\boxed{10}$."
