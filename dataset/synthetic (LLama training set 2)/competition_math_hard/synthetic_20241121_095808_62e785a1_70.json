  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and create a coherent, complete solution step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have positive integers \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\) with the following relationships:\n\n1. \\( a^5 = b^4 \\)\n2. \\( c^3 = d^2 \\)\n3. \\( c - a = 19 \\)\n\nOur goal is to determine \\( d - b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\n- **Exponents and Perfect Powers:** The equations involve exponents, suggesting that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), as well as \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), are related through perfect powers.\n  \n- **Difference Given:** The equation \\( c - a = 19 \\) provides a direct link between \\( c \\) and \\( a \\), which might help in finding specific values.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:** \n  - Expressing variables in terms of common bases.\n  - Solving for one variable in terms of another.\n  - Testing small integer values to find a solution.\n\nLet's explore these strategies step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Expressing Variables with Common Bases**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- **For \\( a^5 = b^4 \\):**  \n  Perhaps \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can be expressed using a common base \\( k \\):\n  \\[\n  a = k^4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = k^5\n  \\]\n  *Checking:*  \n  \\((k^4)^5 = k^{20}\\) and \\((k^5)^4 = k^{20}\\), so it holds.\n\n- **For \\( c^3 = d^2 \\):**  \n  Similarly, let\u2019s express \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) in terms of another base \\( m \\):\n  \\[\n  c = m^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d = m^3\n  \\]\n  *Checking:*  \n  \\((m^2)^3 = m^6\\) and \\((m^3)^2 = m^6\\), so it works.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Promising Start:**  \n  By expressing \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\) in terms of \\( k \\) and \\( m \\), we've simplified the relationships. This seems like a good path forward.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Applying the Given Difference \\( c - a = 19 \\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Substitute the expressions from Strategy 1 into the difference equation:\n  \\[\n  c - a = m^2 - k^4 = 19\n  \\]\n- This equation connects \\( m \\) and \\( k \\), which is crucial for finding their values.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Diophantine Equation:**  \n  This is a Diophantine equation (an equation that seeks integer solutions). It might require factoring or testing specific integer values to find a solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Ready to Proceed:**  \n  Since \\( 19 \\) is a relatively small number, testing small integer values for \\( k \\) could lead us to a solution efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 3: Testing Small Integer Values**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- **Testing \\( k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\):**  \n  Let's try assigning small integer values to \\( k \\) and see if we can find a corresponding \\( m \\) that satisfies \\( m^2 - k^4 = 19 \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Trying \\( k = 1 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  k^4 = 1^4 = 1\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  m^2 = 1 + 19 = 20 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m = \\sqrt{20} \\not\\in \\mathbb{Z}\n  \\]\n  *Conclusion:*  \n  \\( k = 1 \\) doesn't work since \\( m \\) is not an integer.\n\n- **Trying \\( k = 2 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  k^4 = 2^4 = 16\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  m^2 = 16 + 19 = 35 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m = \\sqrt{35} \\not\\in \\mathbb{Z}\n  \\]\n  *Conclusion:*  \n  \\( k = 2 \\) doesn't work either.\n\n- **Trying \\( k = 3 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  k^4 = 3^4 = 81\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  m^2 = 81 + 19 = 100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m = \\sqrt{100} = 10 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n  \\]\n  *Conclusion:*  \n  **Aha!** \\( k = 3 \\) works because \\( m = 10 \\) is an integer.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Success:**  \n  We've found integer values that satisfy the equation \\( m^2 - k^4 = 19 \\). This is a strong indicator that we're on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating \\( a, b, c, d \\) and \\( d - b \\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- **Using \\( k = 3 \\) and \\( m = 10 \\):**  \n  Let's compute \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\) using the expressions from Strategy 1:\n  \\[\n  a = k^4 = 3^4 = 81\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  b = k^5 = 3^5 = 243\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  c = m^2 = 10^2 = 100\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  d = m^3 = 10^3 = 1000\n  \\]\n- **Calculating \\( d - b \\):**  \n  \\[\n  d - b = 1000 - 243 = 757\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a Minute:**  \n  Before finalizing, let's double-check if these values satisfy all the original conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- **Check Each Equation:**\n  1. \\( a^5 = b^4 \\)  \n     \\[\n     81^5 = 243^4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3^{20} = 3^{20} \\quad \\text{\u2705}\n     \\]\n  2. \\( c^3 = d^2 \\)  \n     \\[\n     100^3 = 1000^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 10^6 = 10^6 \\quad \\text{\u2705}\n     \\]\n  3. \\( c - a = 19 \\)  \n     \\[\n     100 - 81 = 19 \\quad \\text{\u2705}\n     \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **All Conditions Met:**  \n  The values satisfy all the given equations, confirming that our solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{757}\n\\]\n\n<ANSWER>\n757\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and successfully testing small integer values, we determined that:\n\n- \\( k = 3 \\) and \\( m = 10 \\) satisfy \\( m^2 - k^4 = 19 \\).\n- This leads to \\( a = 81, b = 243, c = 100, \\) and \\( d = 1000 \\).\n- All original conditions are satisfied:\n  - \\( a^5 = b^4 \\)\n  - \\( c^3 = d^2 \\)\n  - \\( c - a = 19 \\)\n- Therefore, the difference \\( d - b \\) is \\( 757 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\( d - b = \\mathbf{757} \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Closing Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:**  \n  Expressing variables in terms of common bases proved to be an effective starting point.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  Testing small integer values quickly led us to the correct solution, demonstrating the power of simple, direct methods in solving Diophantine equations.\n\n- **Alternative Methods:**  \n  While an algebraic approach could be considered, testing small integers was more efficient and straightforward in this case.\n\n- **Final Check:**  \n  Ensuring all conditions were met confirmed the validity of the solution, providing confidence in the final answer.\n\nOverall, a systematic approach\u2014beginning with brainstorming, applying different strategies, verifying each step, and reflecting on the outcomes\u2014led to a clear and correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "It follows from the givens that $a$ is a perfect fourth power, $b$ is a perfect fifth power, $c$ is a perfect square and $d$ is a perfect cube. Thus, there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $a = t^4$, $b = t^5$, $c = s^2$ and $d = s^3$. So $s^2 - t^4 = 19$. We can factor the left-hand side of this equation as a difference of two squares, $(s - t^2)(s + t^2) = 19$. 19 is a prime number and $s + t^2 > s - t^2$ so we must have $s + t^2 = 19$ and $s - t^2 = 1$. Then $s = 10, t = 3$ and so $d = s^3 = 1000$, $b = t^5 = 243$ and $d-b=\\boxed{757}$."
