  "problem": "Anton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B. On Day 0, Anton counts that there are 30 ants in his ant farm. On Day 5, Anton counts that there are 3281 ants in his ant farm. How many of these are of Species A?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's reframe the approach to present a coherent and complete solution, reflecting on each step to ensure clarity while maintaining the final answer. Here's how I'd naturally build up the solution, checking and adjusting along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive in. Anton has an ant farm with two identical-looking species\u2014A and B. Here's what we know:\n\n- **Species A** doubles every day.\n- **Species B** triples every day.\n- On **Day 0**, there are **30 ants total**.\n- By **Day 5**, the total number of ants is **3,281**.\n\n**Goal:** Determine how many ants are of Species A on Day 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nHmm, this feels like an exponential growth problem. Let me think about the best way to tackle it:\n\n1. **Set Up Exponential Equations:**  \n   Use variables to represent the initial counts of each species and their growth rates.\n\n2. **Trial and Error:**  \n   Guess initial numbers and see if they fit\u2014though that sounds time-consuming.\n\n3. **Ratios and Proportions:**  \n   Maybe analyze how the growth rates affect the totals over time.\n\n**Leaning Towards Strategy 1:**  \nSetting up equations seems the most straightforward and reliable method. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Defining Variables**\n\nI need to represent the initial number of ants for each species. Let's assign:\n\n- \\( A_0 \\) for the initial number of Species A ants.\n- \\( B_0 \\) for the initial number of Species B ants.\n\nOn Day 0, the total is 30 ants, so:\n\n\\[\nA_0 + B_0 = 30 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat makes sense\u2014adding up both species should give the total number of ants initially.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing Growth Over Time**\n\nNow, let's think about how each species grows by Day 5:\n\n- **Species A** doubles every day:  \n  \\[\n  A_5 = A_0 \\times 2^5 = 32A_0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Species B** triples every day:  \n  \\[\n  B_5 = B_0 \\times 3^5 = 243B_0\n  \\]\n  \nBy Day 5, the total number of ants is:\n\n\\[\nA_5 + B_5 = 32A_0 + 243B_0 = 3,281 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, now I have two equations:\n\n1. \\( A_0 + B_0 = 30 \\)\n2. \\( 32A_0 + 243B_0 = 3,281 \\)\n\nThis sets up a system of equations that I can solve to find \\( A_0 \\) and \\( B_0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the System of Equations**\n\nLet's solve these equations simultaneously. I can use substitution or elimination. I'll go with **substitution**:\n\n**Solving for \\( B_0 \\) from Equation 1:**\n\n\\[\nB_0 = 30 - A_0\n\\]\n\n**Substituting into Equation 2:**\n\n\\[\n32A_0 + 243(30 - A_0) = 3,281\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n32A_0 + 7,290 - 243A_0 = 3,281\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n-211A_0 + 7,290 = 3,281\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-211A_0 = 3,281 - 7,290\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-211A_0 = -4,009\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( A_0 \\):\n\n\\[\nA_0 = \\frac{-4,009}{-211} = 19\n\\]\n\n**Finding \\( B_0 \\):**\n\n\\[\nB_0 = 30 - 19 = 11\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, initially, there were **19 ants of Species A** and **11 ants of Species B**. Let's verify this to ensure it aligns with the given total on Day 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verification**\n\nIt's always good to double-check. Let's calculate the total number of ants on Day 5 using these initial values:\n\n- **Species A on Day 5:**  \n  \\[\n  A_5 = 32 \\times 19 = 608\n  \\]\n  \n- **Species B on Day 5:**  \n  \\[\n  B_5 = 243 \\times 11 = 2,673\n  \\]\n  \nTotal on Day 5:\n\n\\[\n608 + 2,673 = 3,281\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe calculated total matches the given number of ants on Day 5. This confirms that our solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determining the Number of Species A on Day 5**\n\nNow, let's find out how many ants of Species A there are on Day 5:\n\n\\[\nA_5 = 32 \\times 19 = 608\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, there are **608 ants of Species A** on Day 5. This aligns perfectly with our calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let's do a quick sanity check:\n\n- Starting with **19 ants** of Species A doubling each day:\n  \\[\n  19 \\times 2^5 = 19 \\times 32 = 608\n  \\]\n  \n- This calculation matches our earlier result.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The approach was correct, and the numbers align with the given conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy methodically setting up and solving a system of equations, we've determined that on Day 5, there are **608 ants of Species A** in Anton's ant farm. This step-by-step approach ensured accuracy and allowed us to verify our solution at each stage.\n\n<ANSWER>  \nInitially, there were **19 ants of Species A** and **11 ants of Species B**.  \nOn Day 5, there are **608 ants of Species A**.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nAnd there we have it\u2014a complete and coherent solution, maintaining the integrity of the final answer while ensuring clarity and correctness throughout the process.",
  "ground_truth": "Suppose that there are $a$ ants of Species A and $b$ ants of Species B on Day 0. We thus have that $a+b=30$. Notice that on Day 1, there will be $2a$ ants of Species A, on Day 2, there will be $2(2a) = 4a$ ants of Species A, and on Day 3, there will be $2(4a)=8a$ ants of Species A, etc. Following this line of reasoning, on Day 5, there will be $2^5a$ ants of Species A and $3^5b$ ants of Species B, meaning that $32a+243b=3281$. We now solve this system of linear equations. We have that $32a+32b=960$, so \\begin{align*}(32a+243b)-(32a+32b) &= 211b \\\\\n&= 3281-960 \\\\\n&= 2321.\\end{align*}We then have $b = \\frac{2321}{211} = 11$. This means that $a=30-11=19$, and there are $32\\cdot 19 = \\boxed{608}$ ants of Species A on Day 5."
