Let's approach this problem as if we're working through it naturally, reflecting, brainstorming, and adjusting our strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, we need to rationalize the denominator of \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}}\\). Hmm, rationalizing usually involves getting rid of the radicals in the denominator. I've dealt with square roots before using conjugates, but this is a **cube root**, which feels a bit trickier. Let me brainstorm some strategies.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Conjugates:** For square roots, multiplying by the conjugate helps. Maybe there's a similar approach for cube roots?\n   \n2. **Apply Algebraic Identities:** I recall there's a formula for the sum and difference of cube roots. Perhaps that could be useful.\n\n3. **Factor the Denominator:** If I can express the denominator in a factored form, maybe I can simplify it.\n\n4. **Numerical Approximation:** Not ideal for exact answers, but could give me an intuition.\n\nI'll start by exploring the **algebraic identities** since that seems promising for cube roots.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Algebraic Identities**\n\nI remember the identity for the difference of cubes:\n\\[\na^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\n\\]\nWait, our denominator is \\(\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}\\). If I let \\(a = \\sqrt[3]{3}\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt[3]{2}\\), then \\(a^3 = 3\\) and \\(b^3 = 2\\).\n\n**Reflection:** But hold on, the identity involves \\(a^3\\) and \\(b^3\\), and our denominator is just \\(a - b\\). Maybe I can use this identity to help rationalize.\n\n### **Step 2: Multiplying by a Clever Form of 1**\n\nTo rationalize, I need to eliminate the cube roots in the denominator. Looking at the identity, if I multiply the numerator and denominator by \\(a^2 + ab + b^2\\), the denominator should simplify nicely.\n\n**Let\u2019s Try It:**\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\\[\nM = \\sqrt[3]{3}, \\quad N = \\sqrt[3]{2}\n\\]\nSo, our expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{M - N}\n\\]\nWe'll multiply both the numerator and denominator by:\n\\[\nM^2 + MN + N^2\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\cdot (M^2 + MN + N^2)}{(M - N)(M^2 + MN + N^2)}\n\\]\nAccording to the identity:\n\\[\n(M - N)(M^2 + MN + N^2) = M^3 - N^3 = 3 - 2 = 1\n\\]\n**Wow!** The denominator simplifies to 1. That makes the expression much simpler.\n\n**Simplified Expression:**\n\\[\nM^2 + MN + N^2 = \\sqrt[3]{3}^2 + \\sqrt[3]{3} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{2} + \\sqrt[3]{2}^2\n\\]\nCalculating each term:\n\\[\nM^2 = 3^{\\frac{2}{3}}, \\quad MN = (3 \\cdot 2)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 6^{\\frac{1}{3}}, \\quad N^2 = 2^{\\frac{2}{3}}\n\\]\nSo, the numerator becomes:\n\\[\n3^{\\frac{2}{3}} + 6^{\\frac{1}{3}} + 2^{\\frac{2}{3}}\n\\]\nAnd since the denominator is 1, our rationalized expression is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{6} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{6} + \\sqrt[3]{4}\n\\]\n**Reflection:** This seems to work perfectly! The denominator is eliminated, and we've expressed the numerator in terms of cube roots, which matches the desired form.\n\n### **Step 3: Expressing in the Required Form**\n\nNow, we need to express our answer in the form \\(\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{A} + \\sqrt[3]{B} + \\sqrt[3]{C}}{D}\\) and find \\(A + B + C + D\\).\n\nFrom our simplified expression:\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{6} + \\sqrt[3]{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{6} + \\sqrt[3]{4}}{1}\n\\]\nHere, we can identify:\n\\[\nA = 9, \\quad B = 6, \\quad C = 4, \\quad D = 1\n\\]\n**Calculating \\(A + B + C + D\\):**\n\\[\n9 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 20\n\\]\n**Final Answer:** \n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Did we eliminate the cube roots from the denominator?** Yes, the denominator simplified to 1.\n- **Is the numerator in the desired form?** Yes, it\u2019s expressed as a sum of cube roots.\n- **Is the fraction in lowest terms?** Yes, since the denominator is 1.\n- **Have we correctly identified \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\)?** Yes, they are 9, 6, 4, and 1, respectively.\n\nEverything checks out! The method worked smoothly, and the final answer is \\(20\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since the denominator involves cube roots, we can't just multiply by a conjugate. Instead we use the identity $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. Letting $a = \\sqrt[3]{3}$ and $b = \\sqrt[3]{2}$, we have \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}} \\cdot \\frac{(\\sqrt[3]{3})^2 + \\sqrt[3]{3} \\sqrt[3]{2} + (\\sqrt[3]{2})^2}{(\\sqrt[3]{3})^2 + \\sqrt[3]{3} \\sqrt[3]{2} + (\\sqrt[3]{2})^2}.\n\\]The denominator simplifies by the above identity to $(\\sqrt[3]{3})^3 - (\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 = 1$, so we are left with $\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{6} + \\sqrt[3]{4}$. Matching the form given in the problem, $D = 1$ and $A = 9$, $B = 6$, $C = 4$ (in some order), so $A+B+C+D = \\boxed{20}$."
