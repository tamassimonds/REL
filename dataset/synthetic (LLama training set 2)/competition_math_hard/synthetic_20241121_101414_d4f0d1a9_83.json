  "problem": "Suppose that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits less than $6$, and suppose we have ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. Find the three-digit number ${ABC}$.

  "solution": "Sure, let's refine the approach, making it concise while maintaining the logical flow. I'll remove unnecessary parts, keep the essential reasoning, and ensure the final answer remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen tackling this problem, my initial instinct is to **convert the base-6 numbers into base-10** to set up clear equations. This approach often simplifies understanding and solving base-related problems.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Equations**\n\nGiven:\n1. \\( {AB}_6 + {C}_6 = {C}0_6 \\)\n2. \\( {AB}_6 + {BA}_6 = {CC}_6 \\)\n\n**Interpretation:**\n- \\( {AB}_6 \\): Two-digit number in base-6 with digits \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n- \\( {C}_6 \\): Single-digit number in base-6.\n- \\( {C}0_6 \\) and \\( {CC}_6 \\): Two-digit numbers in base-6.\n\n**Initial Thought:**  \nConverting these to base-10 should help in forming solvable equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Converting to Base-10**\n\n**Equation 1:**  \n\\[ {AB}_6 + {C}_6 = {C}0_6 \\]\n\nConvert to base-10:  \n- \\( {AB}_6 = 6A + B \\)\n- \\( {C}_6 = C \\)\n- \\( {C}0_6 = 6C \\)\n\n**Base-10 Equation:**  \n\\[ (6A + B) + C = 6C \\]  \n\\[ 6A + B + C = 6C \\]  \n\\[ 6A + B = 5C \\] \\[ \\text{\u2014(1)} \\]\n\n**Equation 2:**  \n\\[ {AB}_6 + {BA}_6 = {CC}_6 \\]\n\nConvert to base-10:  \n- \\( {AB}_6 = 6A + B \\)\n- \\( {BA}_6 = 6B + A \\)\n- \\( {CC}_6 = 7C \\)\n\n**Base-10 Equation:**  \n\\[ (6A + B) + (6B + A) = 7C \\]  \n\\[ 7A + 7B = 7C \\]  \n\\[ A + B = C \\] \\[ \\text{\u2014(2)} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWe now have two equations:\n- \\( 6A + B = 5C \\)\n- \\( A + B = C \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Equations**\n\nSubstitute Equation (2) into Equation (1):\n\n\\[ 6A + B = 5(A + B) \\]  \n\\[ 6A + B = 5A + 5B \\]  \n\\[ A = 4B \\] \\[ \\text{\u2014(3)} \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThis relationship implies that \\( A \\) is four times \\( B \\). Given that \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) are distinct digits less than 6, let's explore the possible values.\n\n**Checking Validity:**  \n- If \\( B = 1 \\), then \\( A = 4 \\times 1 = 4 \\)\n- If \\( B = 2 \\), \\( A = 8 \\) (which exceeds 5, so it's invalid)\n- Higher \\( B \\) values make \\( A \\) exceed 5, which is not allowed.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOnly \\( B = 1 \\) and \\( A = 4 \\) satisfy \\( A = 4B \\) within the given constraints.\n\n**Determining \\( C \\):**  \nFrom Equation (2):  \n\\[ A + B = C \\]  \n\\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \\]  \nSo, \\( C = 5 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll digits \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 1 \\), and \\( C = 5 \\) are distinct and less than 6. This seems to satisfy all conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Given Values:**  \n\\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 1 \\), \\( C = 5 \\)\n\n**Check Equation 1:**  \n\\[ {AB}_6 + {C}_6 = {C}0_6 \\]  \n\\[ {41}_6 + {5}_6 = {50}_6 \\]  \n\nConvert to base-10:  \n- \\( {41}_6 = 6 \\times 4 + 1 = 25 \\)\n- \\( {5}_6 = 5 \\)\n- \\( {50}_6 = 6 \\times 5 + 0 = 30 \\)\n\n**Verification:**  \n\\[ 25 + 5 = 30 \\]  \n\\[ 30 = 30 \\]  \n\u2705 **Equation 1 is satisfied.**\n\n**Check Equation 2:**  \n\\[ {AB}_6 + {BA}_6 = {CC}_6 \\]  \n\\[ {41}_6 + {14}_6 = {55}_6 \\]  \n\nConvert to base-10:  \n- \\( {41}_6 = 25 \\)\n- \\( {14}_6 = 6 \\times 1 + 4 = 10 \\)\n- \\( {55}_6 = 6 \\times 5 + 5 = 35 \\)\n\n**Verification:**  \n\\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \\]  \n\\[ 35 = 35 \\]  \n\u2705 **Equation 2 is satisfied.**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth equations hold true, confirming that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nGiven the digits \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 1 \\), and \\( C = 5 \\), the three-digit number in base-6 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{{415}_6}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically converting the base-6 equations to base-10, solving the resulting system of equations, and verifying the solution, we've confidently determined that the three-digit number \\( {ABC}_6 \\) is \\( {415}_6 \\).\n\n---\n\nI hope this refined approach makes the solution clearer and more straightforward!",
  "ground_truth": "Dealing with the second condition, it is set up in the following manner. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&&C_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&0_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$Because $B+C$ can not equal $0$, we must carry in this column. Therefore, we arrive at two equations. $B+C-6=0$ and $A+1=C$ Looking at the third condition: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&B&A_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&C_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$We can determine that no carrying occurs. Therefore, $A+B=C$. We now have a system of equations for our three variables. \\[B+C-6=0\\]\\[A+1=C\\]\\[A+B=C\\]Subtracting the third equation from the second, $1-B=0$, or $B=1$. Plugging that into our first equation we can determine that $C=5$. $A$ must then equal $4$. Thus, $\\overline{ABC}$ is $\\boxed{415}$."
