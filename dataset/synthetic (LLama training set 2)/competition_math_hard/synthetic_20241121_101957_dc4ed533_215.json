  "solution": "Alright! Let's dive back into this problem, keeping my original approach but being open to identifying and correcting any missteps along the way. I'll walk through my thought process just like before, but this time, I'll catch where I went wrong and adjust accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, so we've got a rational function \\(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\) with the following characteristics:\n\n- **Horizontal Asymptote:** \\(y = 0\\)\n- **Vertical Asymptote:** \\(x = -1\\)\n- **\\(q(x)\\) is Quadratic**\n- Given Points: \\(p(2) = 1\\) and \\(q(2) = 3\\)\n\nOur goal is to find \\(p(x) + q(x)\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Wait, what?** At first glance, it seems like we need to determine both \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\), then sum them up. Since \\(q(x)\\) is quadratic, maybe we can assume a general form for it. Similarly, \\(p(x)\\) might have a specific structure.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. Find \\(q(x)\\) first using its properties.\n  2. Determine \\(p(x)\\) using the given point.\n  3. Add them together to find \\(p(x) + q(x)\\).\n\n- **Does this remind me of anything?** This feels similar to problems where asymptotes guide the behavior of rational functions.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Analyzing the Asymptotes**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Horizontal Asymptote \\(y = 0\\):** This suggests that as \\(x\\) approaches infinity, \\(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\) approaches zero. Typically, this means the degree of \\(p(x)\\) is less than the degree of \\(q(x)\\).\n\n- **Vertical Asymptote \\(x = -1\\):** This indicates that \\(q(x)\\) has a factor of \\((x + 1)\\) since the denominator becomes zero at \\(x = -1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, having a vertical asymptote at \\(x = -1\\) implies \\(q(x)\\) must have \\((x + 1)\\) as a root.\n\n### **Action:**\n\n- Let's express \\(q(x)\\) knowing it has a factor of \\((x + 1)\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Constructing \\(q(x)\\)**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Since \\(q(x)\\) is quadratic:** We can write it as \\(q(x) = a(x + 1)(x - r)\\), where \\(r\\) is the other root.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Instead of assuming distinct roots, I initially thought of \\(q(x) = a(x + 1)^2\\). But wait\u2014having only one vertical asymptote suggests there might be a repeated root or that \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) share a factor.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Actually, looking at this again:** If there's only one vertical asymptote and a horizontal asymptote at \\(y = 0\\), it might mean that \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) share a common factor that cancels out, leaving only the remaining factors to dictate the asymptotes.\n\n- **Hmm, let me double-check my reasoning here:** The graph likely has a hole at \\(x = 1\\) because there's a circle drawn at \\((1, 0.5)\\), suggesting that both \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) have a factor of \\((x - 1)\\).\n\n**New Insight:**\n\n- **Oh!** This reminds me that if there's a **hole** in the graph (a point where both numerator and denominator are zero), then \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) must share a factor corresponding to that point. \n\n### **Action:**\n\n- Let's assume:\n  \\[\n  p(x) = a(x - 1)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  q(x) = b(x + 1)(x - 1)\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Verifying with Given Points**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Given \\(p(2) = 1\\):** Plug \\(x = 2\\) into \\(p(x)\\):\n  \\[\n  a(2 - 1) = a = 1\n  \\]\n  So, \\(p(x) = x - 1\\).\n\n- **Given \\(q(2) = 3\\):** Plug \\(x = 2\\) into \\(q(x)\\):\n  \\[\n  q(2) = b(2 + 1)(2 - 1) = 3b = 3 \\implies b = 1\n  \\]\n  So, \\(q(x) = (x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Plugging back the values:\n  - \\(p(2) = 1(2 - 1) = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - \\(q(2) = 1(3)(1) = 3\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, the calculations align perfectly with the given points.\n\n### **Action:**\n\n- We've successfully determined:\n  \\[\n  p(x) = x - 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  q(x) = x^2 - 1\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Formulating the Rational Function**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Putting it all together:** Now, our rational function is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \\frac{x - 1}{x^2 - 1}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Factorizing \\(q(x)\\):**\n  \\[\n  x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying the Rational Function:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{x - 1}{(x - 1)(x + 1)} = \\frac{1}{x + 1} \\quad \\text{(for } x \\neq 1\\text{)}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this match the asymptotes?**\n  - **Vertical Asymptote:** At \\(x = -1\\), the denominator is zero\u2014matches the given.\n  - **Horizontal Asymptote:** As \\(x \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\frac{1}{x + 1} \\to 0\\)\u2014matches the given.\n\n- **Wait a minute:** This simplification also reveals a **hole** at \\(x = 1\\), which aligns with the graph showing a hole at \\((1, 0.5)\\).\n\n### **Action:**\n\n- Our rational function is consistent with the given asymptotic behavior and the hole in the graph.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Calculating \\(p(x) + q(x)\\)**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Now, let's find \\(p(x) + q(x)\\):**\n  \\[\n  p(x) + q(x) = (x - 1) + (x^2 - 1) = x^2 + x - 2\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Let's verify by plugging back the given points:\n  - At \\(x = 2\\):\n    \\[\n    p(2) + q(2) = (2 - 1) + (4 - 1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n    \\]\n  - **Hmm, interesting:** The sum at \\(x = 2\\) is \\(4\\), but we weren't given \\(p(2) + q(2)\\), so this doesn't directly validate our answer. However, the individual components \\(p(2) = 1\\) and \\(q(2) = 3\\) still hold true.\n\n- **Final Check:** Does the expression \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) make sense? Yes, since we've correctly accounted for both \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\).\n\n### **ACTION: Conclude the Solution**\n\n- **Final Answer:**\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{x^2 + x - 2}\n  \\]\n  \n<ANSWER>x^2 + x - 2</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Identified key characteristics of the rational function and the given data.\n\n2. **Initial Brainstorming:** Considered finding \\(q(x)\\) first and then \\(p(x)\\), but realized the need for a shared factor due to the hole in the graph.\n\n3. **Constructing \\(q(x)\\):** Assumed \\(q(x)\\) has factors corresponding to the vertical asymptote and the hole.\n\n4. **Verifying with Given Points:** Used \\(p(2) = 1\\) and \\(q(2) = 3\\) to solve for coefficients, confirming the forms of \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\).\n\n5. **Formulating the Rational Function:** Simplified \\(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\) to verify consistency with the asymptotes and the hole.\n\n6. **Calculating \\(p(x) + q(x)\\):** Added the expressions for \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) to find the final answer.\n\n7. **Final Check:** Ensured all parts of the problem were addressed and that the solution was consistent with the given data.\n\n---\n\nBy carefully reconsidering each step and being open to adjusting strategies when inconsistencies arise, we've arrived at the correct solution while ensuring all components of the problem are thoroughly addressed.",
  "ground_truth": "Since $q(x)$ is a quadratic, and we have a horizontal asymptote at $y=0,$ we know that $p(x)$ must be linear.\n\nSince we have a hole at $x=1,$ there must be a factor of $x-1$ in both $p(x)$ and $q(x).$ Additionally, since there is a vertical asymptote at $x=-1,$ the denominator $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x+1.$ Then, $p(x) = a(x-1)$ and $q(x) = b(x+1)(x-1),$ for some constants $a$ and $b.$\n\nSince $p(2) = 1$, we have $a(2-1) = 1$ and hence $a=1$. Since $q(2) = 3$, we have $b(2+1)(2-1) = 3$ and hence $b=1$.\n\nSo $p(x) = x - 1$ and $q(x) = (x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1,$ so $p(x) + q(x) = \\boxed{x^2 + x - 2}.$"
