    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, explore different strategies, reflect on each step, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving this naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I notice a few key elements:\n\n1. **Forty Teams in a Tournament:** Every team plays every other team exactly once.\n2. **No Ties and Equal Probability:** Each game has a 50% chance of being won by either team.\n3. **Unique Win Counts:** We need to find the probability that no two teams have the same number of wins.\n\n**Initial Idea:** This reminds me of problems involving **combinations and permutations**, especially since we're dealing with unique outcomes (no two teams having the same number of wins).\n\nBut wait\u2014forty teams mean a lot of possible outcomes. Maybe it's similar to a **Pigeonhole Principle** problem, where having more \"pigeons\" (teams) than \"holes\" (possible win counts) forces at least two teams to have the same number of wins.\n\nLet's explore this further.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Combinatorics Approach:**\n   - Calculate the total number of ways the games can be won.\n   - Determine the number of ways to assign unique win counts to all teams.\n   - Find the probability by dividing these two quantities.\n\n2. **Probability Distribution:**\n   - Consider the distribution of wins across teams.\n   - Use properties of binomial distributions to see if unique win counts are possible.\n\n3. **Pigeonhole Principle:**\n   - With 40 teams and a limited number of possible win counts, is uniqueness even feasible?\n   - Assess whether it's possible for all teams to have different win totals.\n\n**Reflection:** The Pigeonhole Principle seems promising because it directly relates to the uniqueness requirement. However, combinatorics might give us a more precise probability calculation. Let's start with the combinatorics approach and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Combinatorics Approach: Total Number of Outcomes**\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of games played.\n\n- **Thought:** Each team plays every other team once. With 40 teams, the number of games is the combination of 40 taken 2 at a time.\n- \\[\n\\text{Total Games} = \\binom{40}{2} = \\frac{40 \\times 39}{2} = 780\n\\]\n\n**Check:** That seems correct\u2014each team plays 39 others, and dividing by 2 avoids double-counting.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the total number of possible outcomes for these games.\n\n- **Thought:** Each game has two possible outcomes (one team wins or the other), so for 780 games:\n- \\[\n2^{780} \\text{ total outcomes}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Yes, this makes sense. Each game independently contributes two possible outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### **Assigning Unique Win Counts**\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the possible number of wins each team can have.\n\n- **Thought:** Each team plays 39 games, so the number of wins can range from 0 to 39.\n- **Possible Win Counts:** 0, 1, 2, ..., 39 (40 distinct win totals)\n\n**Check:** With 40 teams and 40 possible win totals, it seems theoretically possible for each team to have a unique number of wins.\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the number of ways to assign unique win counts to all teams.\n\n- **Thought:** This is essentially assigning each team a unique number of wins from 0 to 39, which is a permutation problem.\n- \\[\n40! \\text{ ways to assign unique win counts}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Since each team must have a distinct number of wins, this aligns with permutations.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating the Desired Probability**\n\n**Step 5:** Find the probability that all teams have unique win counts.\n\n- **Thought:** Probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes (unique assignments) to total possible outcomes.\n- \\[\nP(\\text{unique win counts}) = \\frac{40!}{2^{780}}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** This follows from basic probability principles.\n\n**Reflection:** This expression seems correct, but the problem asks for the probability in the form \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) and then to find \\(\\log_2 n\\). We need to simplify this expression.\n\n---\n\n### **Simplifying the Probability Expression**\n\n**Step 6:** Simplify \\( \\frac{40!}{2^{780}} \\) to match the required form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\).\n\n- **Thought:** Since \\(40!\\) is a large number, we'll likely need to factor out powers of 2 to simplify the denominator.\n- **Idea:** Factor \\(40!\\) to find how many times 2 divides into it (i.e., find the highest power of 2 in the factorization of \\(40!\\)).\n\n**Reflection:** This reminds me of finding the largest power of a prime in a factorial, which is a standard technique in combinatorics.\n\n**Step 7:** Determine the highest power of 2 in \\(40!\\).\n\n- **Thought:** Use the formula for finding the highest power of a prime \\(p\\) dividing \\(n!\\):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Power of } p \\text{ in } n! = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n  \\]\n- **Application for \\(p = 2\\) and \\(n = 40\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{8} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{16} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{32} \\right\\rfloor = 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 38\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:** Adding these up gives 38, which means \\(2^{38}\\) divides \\(40!\\).\n\n**Step 8:** Rewrite the probability incorporating this factor.\n\n- **Thought:** We can express \\(40!\\) as \\(2^{38} \\times k\\), where \\(k\\) is \\( \\frac{40!}{2^{38}} \\). This helps simplify the fraction.\n- **Substitution:**\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{unique win counts}) = \\frac{2^{38} \\times k}{2^{780}} = \\frac{k}{2^{742}} \\quad \\text{(since } 780 - 38 = 742\\text{)}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:** By factoring out the highest power of 2, we've simplified the denominator significantly.\n\n---\n\n### **Expressing the Probability in Reduced Form**\n\n**Step 9:** Identify \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in \\( \\frac{k}{2^{742}} \\), where \\(k = \\frac{40!}{2^{38}} \\).\n\n- **Thought:** Here, \\(m = k\\) and \\(n = 2^{742}\\). Since there's no factor of 2 remaining in \\(k\\), the fraction is in reduced form.\n- **Conclusion:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{k}{2^{742}} = \\frac{\\frac{40!}{2^{38}}}{2^{742}} = \\frac{40!}{2^{780}}\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:** This aligns with our earlier expression. Now, we just need to find \\(\\log_2 n\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation: Finding \\(\\log_2 n\\)**\n\n**Step 10:** Compute \\(\\log_2 n\\), where \\(n = 2^{742}\\).\n\n- **Thought:** The logarithm base 2 of \\(2^{742}\\) simplifies directly.\n- \\[\n\\log_2 n = \\log_2 (2^{742}) = 742\n\\]\n  \n**Check:** This is straightforward\u2014\\(\\log_2\\) and the exponent cancel out.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Answer**\n\nAfter walking through the problem step by step, factoring the probability expression, and simplifying it, we've determined that:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2 n = \\boxed{742}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** By systematically breaking down the problem, exploring different strategies, and carefully simplifying expressions, we've arrived at the correct answer. Each step was crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the final result.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis problem required a blend of combinatorial thinking and probability concepts. Initially, it seemed daunting due to the large numbers involved, but by methodically applying fundamental principles like permutations and factoring, we managed to simplify the problem effectively. Always remember:\n\n- **Breaking Down the Problem:** Tackling complex problems step by step makes them more manageable.\n- **Verifying Each Step:** Regular checks prevent errors from propagating.\n- **Flexibility:** Being open to changing strategies ensures that you're always on the right path.\n\nBy adopting this approach, even the most challenging problems become solvable.",

  "ground_truth": "There are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ total pairings of teams, and thus $2^{780}$ possible outcomes. In order for no two teams to win the same number of games, they must each win a different number of games. Since the minimum and maximum possible number of games won are 0 and 39 respectively, and there are 40 teams in total, each team corresponds uniquely with some $k$, with $0 \\leq k \\leq 39$, where $k$ represents the number of games the team won. With this in mind, we see that there are a total of $40!$ outcomes in which no two teams win the same number of games. Further, note that these are all the valid combinations, as the team with 1 win must beat the team with 0 wins, the team with 2 wins must beat the teams with 1 and 0 wins, and so on; thus, this uniquely defines a combination.\nThe desired probability is thus $\\frac{40!}{2^{780}}$. We wish to simplify this into the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. The only necessary step is to factor out all the powers of 2 from $40!$; the remaining number is clearly relatively prime to all powers of 2.\nThe number of powers of 2 in $40!$ is $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{2} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{4} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{8} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{16} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{32} \\right \\rfloor = 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 38.$\n$780-38 = \\boxed{742}$."
