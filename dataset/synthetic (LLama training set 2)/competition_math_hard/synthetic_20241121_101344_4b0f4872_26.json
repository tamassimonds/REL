  "solution": "Sure, let's consolidate the thought process into a polished, coherent solution while keeping the final answer intact.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**Objective:**  \nDetermine Sam's average speed from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. based on a graph showing total distance over time.\n\n**Initial Approach:**  \nCalculate average speed using total distance and time:  \n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Extracting Data from the Graph**\n\n**Total Time:**  \n6 a.m. to 11 a.m. = **5 hours**\n\n**Total Distance:**  \nAccording to the graph, by 11 a.m., Sam drove **160 miles**.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n5 hours \u00d7 32 mph = 160 miles \u2714\ufe0f\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Average Speed**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{160 \\text{ miles}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 32 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n32 mph over 5 hours results in the total distance of 160 miles, confirming correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Validating the Approach**\n\n**Graph Analysis:**  \n- **6 a.m. to 7 a.m.:** 40 miles\n- **7 a.m. to 8 a.m.:** 20 miles\n- **8 a.m. to 9 a.m.:** 40 miles\n- **9 a.m. to 10 a.m.:** 20 miles\n- **10 a.m. to 11 a.m.:** 40 miles\n\n**Average Speed Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{40 + 20 + 40 + 20 + 40}{5} = \\frac{160}{5} = 32 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBoth direct calculation and interval averaging yield the same result, validating the approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\nSam's average speed from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. is **32 miles per hour (mph)**.\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Post-Check Recap**\n\n- **Multiple Methods Consistency:** Both total distance/time and interval averaging confirm the average speed.\n- **Efficiency:** The direct approach is straightforward and effective.\n- **Final Verification:** All checks align, ensuring the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Outcome:**  \nThe problem is successfully solved with a confirmed average speed of 32 mph.\n\n---\n\nI hope this cleaned-up version captures the essence of a natural problem-solving process while maintaining clarity and correctness.",
  "ground_truth": "Since he traveled 160 miles in 5 hours, his speed measured in miles per hour is $\\frac{160}{5} = \\boxed{32}$."
