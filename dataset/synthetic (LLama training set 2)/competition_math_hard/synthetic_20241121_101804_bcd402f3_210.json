  "solution": "Alright, let\u2019s walk through solving this problem step by step, just like how I would approach it naturally, brainstorming and checking along the way. We'll keep the final answer the same but enhance the clarity and coherence of the process.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n---\n\nOkay, we have **two parabolas:**\n\n- \\( y = 2x^2 - 10x - 10 \\)\n- \\( y = x^2 - 4x + 6 \\)\n\n**Goal:** Find all points where these parabolas intersect and list them in order of increasing \\( x \\)-coordinate.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\n- **Intersection Points:** Sounds like we need to find where both parabolas share the same \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) values.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Set Equations Equal:** Since intersection points have the same \\( y \\) for the same \\( x \\), setting the equations equal might work.\n  - **Graphing:** Visualizing could help, but might only give approximate solutions.\n  - **Algebraic Methods:** Substitution or elimination could be solid options.\n  \n**Decision:** Let's start by **setting the equations equal** to find exact intersection points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting the Equations Equal**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf the parabolas intersect, their \\( y \\)-values must be equal at those points. So, let's set the two equations equal:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 10x - 10 = x^2 - 4x + 6\n\\]\n\n**First Check:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, because we're looking for points where both parabolas have the same output for the same input.\n\n**Proceeding:** This approach seems logical, so let's move forward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Equation**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), I need to simplify this equation. Let's bring all terms to one side to form a standard quadratic equation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubtract \\( x^2 \\), add \\( 4x \\), and subtract \\( 6 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n(2x^2 - x^2) - (10x - 4x) - (10 - 6) = 0\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x - 16 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Did I Combine Terms Correctly?**\n  - \\( 2x^2 - x^2 = x^2 \\)\n  - \\( -10x + 4x = -6x \\)\n  - \\( -10 - 6 = -16 \\)\n  \nEverything checks out!\n\n**Decision:** The equation is correctly simplified to a quadratic.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to solve \\( x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 \\). Let's explore possible methods:\n\n- **Factoring:** Quick if possible.\n- **Quadratic Formula:** Reliable if factoring is tough.\n- **Completing the Square:** An alternative, but possibly more tedious.\n\n**First Attempt: Factoring**\n\nLet's see if this quadratic can be factored.\n\n**Looking for Two Numbers That:**\n\n- Multiply to \\(-16\\)\n- Add to \\(-6\\)\n\n**Brainstorm:**\n\n- Factors of \\(-16\\): \\( -8 \\times 2 = -16 \\) and \\( -8 + 2 = -6 \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSo, the equation can be factored as:\n\n\\[\n(x - 8)(x + 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**First Check:**\n\n- **Does Factoring Work?**\n  - Expanding: \\( x^2 + 2x - 8x - 16 = x^2 - 6x - 16 \\)\n  \n**Reflection:** Yes, factoring is correct!\n\n**Decision:** Factoring was successful, so let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the \\( x \\)-Coordinates**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSet each factor equal to zero to find the \\( x \\)-values.\n\n\\[\nx - 8 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 8\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -2\n\\]\n\n**First Check:**\n\n- **Do These Solutions Make Sense?** Yes, solving each factor individually gives valid \\( x \\)-coordinates.\n\n**Reflection:** This step is straightforward and correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determining the Corresponding \\( y \\)-Coordinates**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the \\( x \\)-coordinates, I need to find the corresponding \\( y \\)-coordinates for each point. Since both parabolas intersect at these \\( x \\)-values, plugging them into either equation should yield the same \\( y \\).\n\n**Brainstorm:**\n\n- **Plug Each \\( x \\) Into Either Equation:** To find \\( y \\).\n- **Quick Verification:** Check both equations to ensure consistency.\n\n**Action:** Let's plug \\( x = 8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) into the first equation \\( y = 2x^2 - 10x - 10 \\).\n\n---\n\n**Calculation for \\( x = 8 \\):**\n\n\\[\ny = 2(8)^2 - 10(8) - 10\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 2(64) - 80 - 10\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 128 - 80 - 10 = 38\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check with the Second Equation:**\n\n\\[\ny = (8)^2 - 4(8) + 6\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 64 - 32 + 6 = 38\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Both equations give \\( y = 38 \\) for \\( x = 8 \\). That's consistent!\n\n---\n\n**Calculation for \\( x = -2 \\):**\n\nUsing the first equation:\n\n\\[\ny = 2(-2)^2 - 10(-2) - 10\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 2(4) + 20 - 10\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 8 + 20 - 10 = 18\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check with the Second Equation:**\n\n\\[\ny = (-2)^2 - 4(-2) + 6\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 4 + 8 + 6 = 18\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Both equations give \\( y = 18 \\) for \\( x = -2 \\). Everything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Listing the Intersection Points**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I have two intersection points:\n\n- \\( (8, 38) \\)\n- \\( (-2, 18) \\)\n\nThe problem asks to list them in order of increasing \\( x \\)-coordinate.\n\n**Action:** Arrange the points:\n\n\\[\n(-2, 18); \\quad (8, 38)\n\\]\n\n**First Check:**\n\n- **Is the Ordering Correct?** Yes, \\(-2\\) is less than \\(8\\), so the points are correctly ordered.\n\n**Reflection:** The points are correctly listed in ascending order of \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's double-check each step to ensure no errors were made.\n\n- **Setting Equations Equal:** Correctly set and simplified to a quadratic.\n- **Factoring:** Successfully factored the quadratic equation.\n- **Solving for \\( x \\):** Obtained valid \\( x \\)-coordinates.\n- **Finding \\( y \\)-Coordinates:** Consistent \\( y \\)-values across both equations.\n- **Ordering Points:** Correctly ordered based on \\( x \\)-coordinates.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Everything Aligns:** No discrepancies found.\n\n**Reflection:** The approach was straightforward, and all checks confirm the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution</ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-2, 18); \\quad (8, 38)}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy setting the two equations equal, simplifying to a quadratic, factoring, and then solving for both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)-coordinates, we successfully found the intersection points. Regular checks at each step ensured the accuracy of the solution, mimicking a natural problem-solving process complete with brainstorming and verification.",
  "ground_truth": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-10x-10=x^2-4x+6$. Combine like terms to get $x^2-6x=16$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{6}{2}\\right)^2=9$ to both sides, giving $(x-3)^2=16+9=25$.\n\nSo we have $x-3=\\pm5$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $8$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2,18)}$ and $\\boxed{(8,38)}$."
