  "problem": "If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers for which $ab - 6a + 5b = 373$, what is the minimal possible value of $|a - b|$?",
  "solution": "### Tackling the Problem Again: A Human Approach to Solving for \\( |a - b| \\)\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem by revisiting my original approach, being more attentive to the details, and adjusting my strategy as needed. I'll walk through my thought process, recognizing where I went off track, and making necessary corrections to arrive at the minimal possible value of \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, we have an equation involving two positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ ab - 6a + 5b = 373 \\]\n\n**Goal:** Find the minimal possible value of \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This looks like a problem with two variables where we need to minimize their absolute difference.\n- Factoring or rearranging the equation might help.\n- Maybe applying **Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (SFFT)** could lead to a solution.\n\nHonestly, I feel a bit unsure about the best starting point, but let's explore a few strategies to see what works.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Factoring the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Factoring might simplify the equation, making it easier to find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- If we can express the equation as a product equal to 373, we could find integer solutions.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet's try to factor the left side:\n\n\\[ ab - 6a + 5b = 373 \\]\n\nHmm, factoring directly isn't straightforward. Maybe we can rearrange terms:\n\n\\[ ab - 6a + 5b - 373 = 0 \\]\n\nStill not obvious how to factor this. Perhaps grouping terms?\n\n\\[ a(b - 6) + 5b = 373 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that doesn't simplify nicely. Factoring directly isn't leading anywhere. I need to think of a different approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFactoring directly isn't working. Let's move on to another strategy.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Completing the Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Completing the square might help transform the equation into a more manageable form.\n- This technique is useful for quadratic equations, so maybe it can apply here.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nRewriting the equation:\n\n\\[ ab - 6a + 5b = 373 \\]\n\nLet's try to complete the square for one of the variables. Focusing on \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ ab - 6a = 373 - 5b \\]\n\nTo complete the square for \\( a \\), we need:\n\n\\[ a(b - 6) = 373 - 5b \\]\n\nBut wait, this doesn't look like it's leading to a perfect square. Completing the square typically works better with quadratic terms, and here we have a product \\( ab \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nActually, looking at this again, completing the square doesn't seem applicable here. This approach isn't yielding a clear path forward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCompleting the square isn't helping. Time to consider another strategy.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Maybe rearranging the equation to isolate one variable could help.\n- Solving for one variable in terms of the other might allow us to find integer solutions.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nStarting with the original equation:\n\n\\[ ab - 6a + 5b = 373 \\]\n\nLet's try to solve for \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ ab - 6a = 373 - 5b \\]\n\nFactor out \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a(b - 6) = 373 - 5b \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{373 - 5b}{b - 6} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFor \\( a \\) to be a positive integer, \\( \\frac{373 - 5b}{b - 6} \\) must be an integer. This condition can be tricky to satisfy, but it gives us a way to find possible values of \\( b \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis seems promising. We can iterate over possible values of \\( b \\) to find valid \\( a \\).\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 4: Iterating Over Possible Values of \\( b \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, we can test different values of \\( b \\) to see when \\( a \\) becomes an integer.\n- Once we find such pairs \\((a, b)\\), we can compute \\( |a - b| \\) and determine the minimal value.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet's start with \\( b = 1 \\) and increase it, checking each time if \\( a \\) is a positive integer.\n\n**Step 1: \\( b = 1 \\) **\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{373 - 5(1)}{1 - 6} = \\frac{373 - 5}{-5} = \\frac{368}{-5} = -73.6 \\]\n\nSince \\( a \\) must be a positive integer, \\( b = 1 \\) doesn't work.\n\n**Step 2: \\( b = 2 \\) **\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{373 - 5(2)}{2 - 6} = \\frac{373 - 10}{-4} = \\frac{363}{-4} = -90.75 \\]\n\nAgain, \\( a \\) is not a positive integer.\n\n**Step 3: \\( b = 3 \\) **\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{373 - 5(3)}{3 - 6} = \\frac{373 - 15}{-3} = \\frac{358}{-3} = -119.33 \\]\n\nStill not a positive integer.\n\n**Step 4: \\( b = 4 \\) **\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{373 - 5(4)}{4 - 6} = \\frac{373 - 20}{-2} = \\frac{353}{-2} = -176.5 \\]\n\nNot a positive integer.\n\n**Step 5: \\( b = 5 \\) **\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{373 - 5(5)}{5 - 6} = \\frac{373 - 25}{-1} = \\frac{348}{-1} = -348 \\]\n\nStill not a positive integer.\n\n**Step 6: \\( b = 6 \\) **\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{373 - 5(6)}{6 - 6} = \\frac{373 - 30}{0} = \\frac{343}{0} \\]\n\nDivision by zero is undefined, so \\( b = 6 \\) is not possible.\n\n**Step 7: \\( b = 7 \\) **\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{373 - 5(7)}{7 - 6} = \\frac{373 - 35}{1} = \\frac{338}{1} = 338 \\]\n\nFinally, \\( a = 338 \\), which is a positive integer.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWe found a valid pair: \\( (a, b) = (338, 7) \\).\n\nNow, let's compute \\( |a - b| \\):\n\n\\[ |338 - 7| = 331 \\]\n\nBut wait, before concluding, let's see if there are other pairs with a smaller \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nActually, continuing this manual iteration might take a while. Perhaps there's a more efficient way to find the minimal \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Realizing the Need for a Better Strategy**\n\nHmm, let me double-check my reasoning here. Manually testing each value of \\( b \\) is slow and might cause me to miss better solutions. I think I need a more systematic approach. Maybe factoring the equation differently could help.\n\n**Wait a minute, I think I see where I went wrong...** I was too focused on iterating values without fully leveraging the equation\u2019s structure. Let's try applying **Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (SFFT)** to see if that leads us to a more efficient solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Corrected Strategy: Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (SFFT)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Simon\u2019s Favorite Factoring Trick involves adding and subtracting the same value to factor an equation cleanly.\n- By rearranging the equation, we might be able to express it as a product of two binomials, making it easier to find integer solutions.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nStarting with the original equation:\n\n\\[ ab - 6a + 5b = 373 \\]\n\nLet's try to factor this by adding and subtracting a specific value. Looking at the terms, adding and subtracting 30 might help:\n\n\\[ ab - 6a + 5b - 30 = 373 - 30 \\]\n\n\\[ ab - 6a + 5b - 30 = 343 \\]\n\nWhy 30? Because it allows us to factor the left side neatly:\n\n\\[ ab - 6a + 5b - 30 = (a + 5)(b - 6) \\]\n\n**Checking the Factoring:**\n\nLet's expand \\( (a + 5)(b - 6) \\) to ensure it matches the original terms:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(a + 5)(b - 6) &= ab - 6a + 5b - 30 \\\\\n&= ab - 6a + 5b - 30 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nYes, it matches! So our factoring is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis factoring transforms the equation into:\n\n\\[ (a + 5)(b - 6) = 343 \\]\n\nNow, we have a product equal to 343. This is much easier to work with!\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis approach is definitely more efficient. By factoring, we can now find integer pairs \\((a + 5), (b - 6)\\) whose product is 343.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with the Corrected Strategy**\n\n#### **Step 1: Finding Factor Pairs of 343**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- 343 is \\( 7^3 \\), so its factors are powers of 7.\n- We need to find all positive integer pairs \\((m, n)\\) such that \\( m \\times n = 343 \\).\n- Each factor pair will correspond to \\( (a + 5) \\) and \\( (b - 6) \\).\n\n**Listing Factor Pairs:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(m, n) &= (1, 343) \\\\\n(m, n) &= (7, 49) \\\\\n(m, n) &= (49, 7) \\\\\n(m, n) &= (343, 1) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThese are all the positive factor pairs of 343. Negative factors are not considered since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's map these factor pairs back to \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Mapping Factor Pairs to \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For each factor pair \\((m, n)\\):\n  \n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na + 5 &= m \\\\\nb - 6 &= n \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n- Therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na &= m - 5 \\\\\nb &= n + 6 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis will give us all possible \\( (a, b) \\) pairs that satisfy the equation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's compute \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) for each factor pair.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculating \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from Factor Pairs**\n\n**Factor Pair 1: \\( (m, n) = (1, 343) \\) **\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 1 - 5 = -4 \\\\\nb &= 343 + 6 = 349 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSince \\( a \\) must be a positive integer, this pair is **invalid**.\n\n---\n\n**Factor Pair 2: \\( (m, n) = (7, 49) \\) **\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 7 - 5 = 2 \\\\\nb &= 49 + 6 = 55 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n|a - b| = |2 - 55| = 53 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is a valid pair with \\( |a - b| = 53 \\).\n\n---\n\n**Factor Pair 3: \\( (m, n) = (49, 7) \\) **\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 49 - 5 = 44 \\\\\nb &= 7 + 6 = 13 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n|a - b| = |44 - 13| = 31 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is another valid pair with a smaller \\( |a - b| = 31 \\).\n\n---\n\n**Factor Pair 4: \\( (m, n) = (343, 1) \\) **\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 343 - 5 = 338 \\\\\nb &= 1 + 6 = 7 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n|a - b| = |338 - 7| = 331 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis pair is valid, but \\( |a - b| = 331 \\), which is larger than the previous pair.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nAfter applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and analyzing all valid factor pairs, the minimal possible value of \\( |a - b| \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{31}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy transforming the original equation into a product of factors and analyzing the possible factor pairs of 343, we determined that the minimal possible value of \\( |a - b| \\) is **31**.\n\n---\n\n### **Human-Like Reflection and Checks**\n\nThroughout this process, I:\n\n- **Started with multiple strategies:** Initially tried factoring and completing the square, which didn't work out.\n- **Adapted my approach:** Moved on to rearranging the equation and iterating over possible values, but realized it was inefficient.\n- **Recognized the need for a better method:** Noticed that manual iteration was slow and potentially unreliable, prompting me to consider factoring the equation differently.\n- **Applied Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick:** Successfully factored the equation into a product, leading to a more straightforward path to the solution.\n- **Validated the solution:** Calculated \\( |a - b| \\) for each valid pair to ensure the minimal value was found.\n- **Finalized the answer:** Confirmed that \\( |a - b| = 31 \\) is the minimal possible value.\n\nThis step-by-step approach mirrors how I would naturally tackle a problem, reflecting and adjusting strategies as needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis exercise highlights the importance of being flexible and reflective when solving problems. Initially, I pursued straightforward strategies like factoring and rearranging, but they didn't yield efficient results. Recognizing the inefficiency, I pivoted to a more sophisticated approach using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, which led me directly to the correct solution. It's a reminder that being open to adjusting one's approach and continuously validating each step is crucial in problem-solving.\n\n---\n\n### **Final **\n\nBy transforming the original equation into a product of factors and carefully analyzing the possible factor pairs of 343, I determined that the minimal possible value of \\( |a - b| \\) is **31**.\n\n---\n\nAlright, I think I've got it now! By carefully applying a more effective strategy and validating each step, I've arrived at the correct minimal value for \\( |a - b| \\).",
  "ground_truth": "We apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and note that if we subtract $30$ from both sides, then the left side can be factored. Thus, $$ab - 6a + 5b -30 = 343 \\rightarrow (a+5)(b-6) = 343$$Since $a,b$ are positive integers, then $a+5, b-6$ must be a pair of factors of $343 = 7^3$, which are given by $\\{a+5,b-6\\} = \\{1,343\\}, \\{7,49\\}, \\{49,7\\}$, or $\\{343,1\\}$. Thus, $\\{a,b\\} = \\{-4,349\\}, \\{2,55\\}, \\{44,13\\}$, or $\\{338,7\\}$. Therefore the minimal value of $|a-b|$ is $|44-13|=\\boxed{31}$."
