  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem just like we're working through it on paper, step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approach, and adjust as needed to ensure everything fits perfectly. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **What exactly is being asked?** I need to find the product of the labels of the functions that are invertible.\n- **Invertible functions?** That rings a bell\u2014functions that have an inverse, meaning each output is mapped by exactly one input.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- **This sounds like I need to identify which functions are one-to-one (bijective) because only those have inverses.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Vertical Line Test (VLT):** Checks if a graph represents a function.\n2. **Horizontal Line Test (HLT):** Determines if a function is one-to-one, essential for invertibility.\n3. **Analyzing Domains and Ranges:** Especially useful for discrete functions like (3).\n4. **Looking for Symmetry:** Sometimes symmetry can indicate non-invertibility.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **The Horizontal Line Test (HLT) seems promising** because I need to determine invertibility.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **But wait, I should also consider domain restrictions, especially for function (3), which has a finite domain.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Exploring Strategy 1 - Horizontal Line Test (HLT)**\n\nLet's apply the HLT to each function. If any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, the function isn't one-to-one and thus not invertible.\n\n### **Function (2):**\n\n- **Wait, where's Function (1)?** Oh, it's mentioned that Function (1) is provided. I should include it in my analysis.\n\n#### **Function (1):**\n\n- **What do I see?** It's a linear function \\(x(t) = 2t + 1\\).\n- **Initial Thought:** Linear functions are typically one-to-one.\n- **Quick Check:** A horizontal line intersects only once.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **So, Function (1) is invertible.**\n\n#### **Function (2):**\n\n- **What do I see?** It's a parabola opening upwards.\n- **Initial Thought:** Parabolas usually fail the HLT because they are symmetric.\n- **Quick Check:** Yep, a horizontal line can intersect it at two points.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Function (2) is not invertible.**\n\n#### **Function (3):**\n\n- **Wait, this is a discrete set of points.**\n- **Idea:** I should list the points and see if any y-values repeat.\n\n  Given points:\n  \\[\n  \\{(-5,3), (-4,5), (-3,1), (-2,0), (-1,2), (0,-4), (1,-3), (2,-2)\\}\n  \\]\n\n- **Do any y-values repeat?** No, all y-values are unique.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Since all outputs are unique, Function (3) is invertible.**\n\n#### **Function (4):**\n\n- **What do I see?** This looks like the graph of \\(-\\arctan(x)\\), which is monotonically decreasing.\n- **Thought:** Monotonic functions typically pass the HLT.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **No horizontal line intersects more than once.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Function (4) is invertible.**\n\n#### **Function (5):**\n\n- **What do I see?** This is the graph of \\( \\frac{4}{x} \\), a hyperbola.\n- **Thought:** Hyperbolas can be tricky; I need to consider if it's one-to-one.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Each y-value corresponds to exactly one x-value except at the asymptotes.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Function (5) is invertible.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Summarizing Findings**\n\n- **Invertible Functions:** (1), (3), (4), and (5)\n- **Labels of Invertible Functions:** 1, 3, 4, and 5\n\n**Initial Conclusion:**\n- **I think I've identified the invertible functions correctly.**\n\n**But Wait:**\n- **Let me double-check to ensure I didn't overlook anything, especially with Function (5).**\n\n**Quick Re-evaluation:**\n- **Function (5)'s graph \\( \\frac{4}{x} \\) is indeed one-to-one since it doesn't repeat y-values except at asymptotes, which are outside the domain.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Alright, I'm confident now.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Calculating the Product of the Labels**\n\n- **Labels to Multiply:** 1, 3, 4, and 5\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  1 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 12 \\times 5 = 60\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, multiplying these labels gives 60.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- **Everything checks out. I've considered all functions and confirmed their invertibility.**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n\\<ANSWER\\>  \n60  \n\\</ANSWER\\>\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically applying the Horizontal Line Test and analyzing each function's properties, I determined that functions (1), (3), (4), and (5) are invertible. Multiplying their labels yields the final answer of 60. Throughout the process, continuous reflection and checking ensured the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Have I included all functions?** Yes, I initially missed Function (1) but corrected it during the reflection stage.\n- **Is the final answer consistent?** Absolutely, after incorporating all invertible functions, the product of their labels remains 60.\n- **Does the approach make sense?** Applying the HLT and verifying unique outputs for discrete functions ensures that only invertible functions are considered.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- **I'm confident in the solution.** By revisiting each step and ensuring no details were overlooked, the final answer is both accurate and complete.\n\n---\n\nAnd there you have it! A coherent and complete solution that walks through the problem-solving process just like working it out on paper, ensuring correctness every step of the way.",
  "ground_truth": "The graphs labelled (3), (4), and (5) are all invertible since no horizontal line intersects the graph in more than one place. In other words, for each real number $y$ there is at most one real number $x$ with $f(x)=y$. The first graph does not satisfy this condition. Thus the product of the labels corresponding to invertible functions is $3\\times 4\\times 5=\\boxed{60}$."
