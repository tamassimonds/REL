If something doesn't work, I'll adjust my approach just like I would if I were solving this on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Initial Reaction:</b></summary>\n- The question asks for the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that both \\( n^2 \\) is divisible by 18 and \\( n^3 \\) is divisible by 640.\n- This reminds me of problems involving **perfect squares** and **perfect cubes** with specific divisibility constraints.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Brainstorming Strategies:</b></summary>\n- **Strategy 1:** Find the prime factorizations of 18 and 640 to determine the necessary factors for \\( n \\).\n- **Strategy 2:** Set up equations based on the divisibility conditions and solve for \\( n \\).\n- **Strategy 3:** Use the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** or **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** to find the smallest \\( n \\).\n  \nI think starting with the prime factorization is a good idea to understand the underlying requirements for \\( n \\).\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Thought Process:</b></summary>\n- Let\u2019s break down 18 and 640 into their prime factors to see what \\( n^2 \\) and \\( n^3 \\) need to include.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Calculations:</b></summary>\n- \\( 18 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\)\n- \\( 640 = 2^7 \\times 5 \\)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Reflection:</b></summary>\n- So, \\( n^2 \\) must be divisible by \\( 2 \\times 3^2 \\), and \\( n^3 \\) must be divisible by \\( 2^7 \\times 5 \\).\n- This means \\( n \\) needs to have certain prime factors raised to specific powers.\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Required Factors for \\( n \\)**\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Thought Process:</b></summary>\n- For \\( n^2 \\) to be divisible by 18, \\( n \\) must include the square roots of these factors.\n- Similarly, for \\( n^3 \\) to be divisible by 640, \\( n \\) must include the cube roots of those factors.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Calculations:</b></summary>\n\n1. **Factors Needed for \\( n^2 \\) Divisibility by 18:**\n   - \\( n^2 \\) must include \\( 2^1 \\) and \\( 3^2 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( n \\) must include at least \\( 2^{1/2} \\) and \\( 3^{2/2} = 3^1 \\).\n   - But since \\( n \\) must be an integer, \\( n \\) must include \\( 2^1 \\) and \\( 3^1 \\).\n\n2. **Factors Needed for \\( n^3 \\) Divisibility by 640:**\n   - \\( n^3 \\) must include \\( 2^7 \\) and \\( 5^1 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( n \\) must include at least \\( 2^{7/3} \\approx 2^{2.33} \\) and \\( 5^{1/3} \\approx 5^{0.33} \\).\n   - Since \\( n \\) must be an integer, we round up the exponents: \\( n \\) must include \\( 2^3 \\) and \\( 5^1 \\).\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Reflection:</b></summary>\n- Wait, that doesn't seem right. For \\( n \\), the exponents must be integers, but rounding up like this might overestimate the requirements.\n\n- **Alternative Idea:** Instead of rounding up, perhaps I should find the least common multiple of the necessary exponents.\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Correcting the Exponent Requirements**\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Thought Process:</b></summary>\n- Let\u2019s carefully determine the minimum exponents needed for \\( n \\) by considering both conditions simultaneously.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Calculations:</b></summary>\n\n1. **Combining Requirements:**\n   - For \\( n^2 \\) divisible by \\( 2^1 \\times 3^2 \\): \n     - \\( n \\) must have at least \\( 2^1 \\) and \\( 3^1 \\).\n   - For \\( n^3 \\) divisible by \\( 2^7 \\times 5^1 \\): \n     - \\( n \\) must have at least \\( 2^{7/3} \\approx 2.33 \\) and \\( 5^{1/3} \\approx 0.33 \\).\n     - Since exponents must be integers, round up to \\( 2^3 \\) and \\( 5^1 \\).\n\n2. **Final Exponent Requirements for \\( n \\):**\n   - \\( n \\) must include:\n     - \\( 2^3 \\) (to satisfy \\( n^3 \\) divisible by \\( 2^7 \\))\n     - \\( 3^1 \\) (to satisfy \\( n^2 \\) divisible by \\( 3^2 \\))\n     - \\( 5^1 \\) (to satisfy \\( n^3 \\) divisible by \\( 5 \\))\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Reflection:</b></summary>\n- Now it seems clearer. By ensuring \\( n \\) includes these factors, both conditions will be satisfied.\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Constructing the Smallest \\( n \\)**\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Thought Process:</b></summary>\n- Now that I know the prime factors required, I can construct the smallest \\( n \\) by multiplying these factors together.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Calculations:</b></summary>\n- \\( n = 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\)\n- \\( n = 8 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 120 \\)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Reflection:</b></summary>\n- So, \\( n = 120 \\). Let\u2019s quickly verify if this satisfies both conditions.\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Thought Process:</b></summary>\n- It's important to check if \\( n = 120 \\) actually meets both divisibility conditions.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Calculations:</b></summary>\n\n1. **Checking \\( n^2 = 120^2 \\):**\n   - \\( 120^2 = 14,400 \\)\n   - Prime factorization of 14,400:\n     - \\( 14,400 = 2^6 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2 \\)\n   - Required for divisibility by 18:\n     - \\( 18 = 2^1 \\times 3^2 \\)\n     - \\( 14,400 \\) includes \\( 2^6 \\) and \\( 3^2 \\), so divisible by 18.\n\n2. **Checking \\( n^3 = 120^3 \\):**\n   - \\( 120^3 = 1,728,000 \\)\n   - Prime factorization of 1,728,000:\n     - \\( 1,728,000 = 2^9 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^3 \\)\n   - Required for divisibility by 640:\n     - \\( 640 = 2^7 \\times 5^1 \\)\n     - \\( 1,728,000 \\) includes \\( 2^9 \\) and \\( 5^3 \\), so divisible by 640.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Reflection:</b></summary>\n- Both conditions are satisfied with \\( n = 120 \\).

  "ground_truth": "Note firstly that $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$, so $n$ must be divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Furthermore, $640 = 2^7 \\cdot 5$, so $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$ and $5$, since the smallest power of 2 that, when cubed, is no smaller than $2^7$ is $2^3$. Therefore, $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$, $3$, and $5$. Note that $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120$ is the smallest possible integer that satisfies all of these conditions, so we have $n = \\boxed{120}$."
