  "problem": "In order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle?",
  "solution": "### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. The question is about calculating the area of a circle based on a diameter measurement that has some error. Specifically, the actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement can be off by up to 20%. We need to find the largest possible percent error in the computed area.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving measurement errors and their impact on calculated quantities. I think the error in the diameter will affect the area, but I'm not sure exactly how yet.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - Calculate the area using the smallest and largest possible diameters.\n  - Determine how errors in diameter translate to errors in the area.\n  - Use proportionality or calculus to relate changes in diameter to changes in area.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm leaning towards calculating the extreme cases (smallest and largest diameters), but I'm not entirely sure if that's the most efficient way. Maybe there's a formula that directly relates diameter errors to area errors?\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Calculating Area with Extreme Diameters**\n\n- **Thought Process:** If the diameter has a 20% error, the smallest possible diameter is 20 cm minus 20% of 20 cm, and the largest is 20 cm plus 20% of 20 cm. I can compute the area for these extreme cases and compare them to the actual area.\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  - Actual Diameter \\( D = 20 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n  - Maximum Error = 20% of 20 cm = \\( 0.2 \\times 20 = 4 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n  - Smallest Diameter \\( D_{\\text{min}} = 20 - 4 = 16 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n  - Largest Diameter \\( D_{\\text{max}} = 20 + 4 = 24 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n\n- **Reflection:** This seems straightforward, but I'm not sure if calculating both extremes is necessary. Maybe focusing on just the largest error would suffice?\n\n**Strategy 2: Relating Diameter Error to Area Error Using Proportionality**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The area of a circle depends on the square of the diameter. So, even a small error in the diameter could lead to a larger error in the area. Perhaps I can find a proportional relationship.\n\n- **Formula Recall:** \n  - Area \\( A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{D}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\)\n  - This means the area is proportional to the square of the diameter.\n\n- **Realization:** Since the area depends on \\( D^2 \\), the percent error in the area will be related to the square of the percent error in the diameter. This might be the key!\n\n**Strategy 3: Using Calculus (Derivatives) to Approximate Error**\n\n- **Thought Process:** I remember that derivatives can be used to approximate how errors in one quantity affect another. Maybe taking the derivative of the area with respect to the diameter could help.\n\n- **Calculation Attempt:**\n  - Let\u2019s see... \n  - \\( \\frac{dA}{dD} = \\pi D \\)\n  - But wait, this seems off. I expected something involving the square of the error.\n\n- **Reflection:** Hmm, this approach isn't giving me the insight I need. Perhaps using proportionality is better.\n\n**Conclusion:** Strategy 2 (Proportionality) seems the most promising.\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Proportionality to Relate Errors**\n\n**Thought Process:** Since the area is proportional to \\( D^2 \\), I can express the area in terms of the square of the diameter and see how an error in \\( D \\) affects \\( A \\).\n\n- **Let\u2019s Define:**\n  - Actual Area \\( A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\)\n  - Measured Diameter \\( D_m = D + \\Delta D \\), where \\( \\Delta D \\) is the error in diameter.\n\n- **Expanding:**\n  - Measured Area \\( A_m = \\frac{\\pi (D_m)^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (D + \\Delta D)^2}{4} \\)\n\n- **Expanding the Square:**\n  - \\( A_m = \\frac{\\pi (D^2 + 2D\\Delta D + (\\Delta D)^2)}{4} \\)\n  - Simplifying: \\( A_m = A + \\frac{\\pi (2D\\Delta D + (\\Delta D)^2)}{4} \\)\n\n**Reflection:** This expansion shows that the error in the area depends on both the linear and quadratic terms of the diameter error. Since \\(\\Delta D\\) is up to 20% of \\( D \\), the quadratic term might be significant.\n\n### **Step 3: Maximizing the Percent Error in the Area**\n\n**Thought Process:** To find the largest possible percent error in the area, I need to consider the maximum possible \\( \\Delta D \\), which is 20% of \\( D \\).\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  - \\( \\Delta D = 0.2 \\times D = 0.2 \\times 20 \\, \\text{cm} = 4 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n  - Plugging into the expanded area formula:\n    - \\( A_m = A + \\frac{\\pi (2 \\times 20 \\times 4 + 4^2)}{4} \\)\n    - \\( A_m = A + \\frac{\\pi (160 + 16)}{4} \\)\n    - \\( A_m = A + \\frac{\\pi \\times 176}{4} \\)\n    - \\( A_m = A + 44\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\)\n\n- **Actual Area:**\n  - \\( A = \\frac{\\pi \\times 20^2}{4} = 100\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\)\n\n- **Percent Error:**\n  - Percent Error \\( = \\frac{A_m - A}{A} \\times 100\\% \\)\n  - \\( = \\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi} \\times 100\\% \\)\n  - \\( = 44\\% \\)\n\n**Reflection:** This calculation suggests that the largest possible percent error in the area is 44%. That seems quite significant. I should double-check to ensure this makes sense.\n\n### **Step 4: Validating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:** Before finalizing, I want to verify if this approach is correct. Does considering both linear and quadratic terms make sense?\n\n- **Check 1: Does the Quadratic Term Matter?**\n  - The quadratic term \\( (\\Delta D)^2 \\) adds extra error since \\( \\Delta D \\) is a significant portion of \\( D \\) (20%). Ignoring it would underestimate the error.\n\n- **Check 2: Comparing with Simpler Approaches**\n  - Using Strategy 1:\n    - Smallest Diameter \\( D_{\\text{min}} = 16 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n    - Largest Diameter \\( D_{\\text{max}} = 24 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n    - Compute areas:\n      - \\( A_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 16^2}{4} = 64\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\)\n      - \\( A_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 24^2}{4} = 144\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\)\n    - Percent Errors:\n      - Minimum Error \\( = \\frac{A_{\\text{min}} - A}{A} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{64\\pi - 100\\pi}{100\\pi} \\times 100\\% = -36\\% \\)\n      - Maximum Error \\( = \\frac{A_{\\text{max}} - A}{A} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{144\\pi - 100\\pi}{100\\pi} \\times 100\\% = 44\\% \\)\n\n- **Check 3: Consistency with Strategy 2**\n  - Both strategies agree that the maximum percent error is 44%.\n\n**Reflection:** Since both strategies yield the same result, I'm confident that the approach is correct. The largest possible percent error in the area is indeed 44%.\n\n### **Step 5: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:** Now that I've verified the calculations and ensured consistency between different strategies, I can confidently state the final answer.\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\text{<ANSWER>solution</ANSWER> The largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle is **44%**.</ANSWER>}}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Solution:**\n\nBy exploring different strategies and validating the approach, I've determined that the largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle is **44%**. This error arises due to the proportional relationship between the diameter and the area, specifically because the area depends on the square of the diameter.",
  "ground_truth": "Juan can measure the diameter as a length anywhere between $20 - 20\\cdot 0.2 = 16$ and $20 + 20\\cdot 0.2 = 24$  cm. The actual area of the circle is $\\pi (20/2)^2=100\\pi$ square cm, but Juan can compute the area anywhere in the range $\\pi (16/2)^2=64 \\pi$ square cm to $\\pi (24/2)^2=144 \\pi$ square cm. Using the lower bound of the range, Juan's error is $(100\\pi - 64\\pi)/(100\\pi)=36\\%$. Using the upper bound of the range, Juan's error is $(144\\pi - 100\\pi)/(100\\pi)=44\\%$. Thus, the largest possible percent error is $\\boxed{44}$ percent."
