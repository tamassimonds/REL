  "problem": "A rectangular band formation is a formation with $m$ band members in each of $r$ rows, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. A particular band has less than 100 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has two members left over. If he increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. What is the largest number of members the band could have?",
  "solution": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem again. I\u2019ll walk through my original thought process, but this time I'll make sure everything flows naturally, catching any inconsistencies and refining my approach as I go. Let's ensure the final answer remains **98**, but presented more coherently.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Approaches**\n\n**Initial Reaction:** This problem seems like a classic combinatorics or algebra challenge involving rectangular arrangements. I\u2019m recalling scenarios where adjusting rows and columns affects the total capacity\u2014like seating arrangements or tiling problems.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Algebraic Setup:** Creating equations based on the conditions given.\n2. **Sample Scenarios:** Testing specific cases to gain insights.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic:** Considering remainders since two members are left over.\n4. **Listing Possibilities:** Given that the total is less than 100, enumerating potential solutions might work.\n\n**Decision:** I'll start with setting up algebraic equations but remain flexible to explore sample scenarios if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Sample Scenarios: Is Algebra the Best Approach?**\n\n**Reflection:** Before jumping into equations, maybe testing a few specific cases could clarify the problem. Sometimes, concrete examples reveal patterns or constraints that aren\u2019t immediately obvious.\n\n**Sample Case:**\n\n- **Suppose:** 10 members.\n- **Arrangement:** 2 rows with 5 members each: \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\).\n- **Outcome:** No leftovers, which doesn\u2019t fit since we need 2 members left over.\n\n**Insight:** This suggests that the total number of spaces must be **less** than the number of members by 2.\n\n**Conclusion:** Sample scenarios are helpful, but I need a more systematic approach to find the exact numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Attempting Algebraic Approach: Using Variables**\n\n**Thoughts:** Let's assign variables to represent the number of rows and members per row. This should help in forming equations to capture the problem's conditions.\n\n- **Let:**\n  - \\( r \\) = number of rows\n  - \\( m \\) = number of members per row\n\n**Given Conditions:**\n\n1. **Original Formation:** \\( r \\times m \\) spaces with 2 members left over:  \n   \\[\n   r \\times m = n - 2\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Adjusted Formation:** Increase members per row by 1 and decrease rows by 2:  \n   \\[\n   (r - 2) \\times (m + 1) = n\n   \\]\n\n**Brainstorming Reflection:** Does this setup make sense? Let\u2019s proceed to see if these equations can lead us to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Equations: Substituting and Simplifying**\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Express \\( n \\) from the first equation:**\n   \\[\n   n = r \\times m + 2\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute \\( n \\) into the second equation:**\n   \\[\n   (r - 2)(m + 1) = r \\times m + 2\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Expand both sides:**\n   \\[\n   rm - 2m + r - 2 = rm + 2\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Simplify:**\n   \\[\n   -2m + r - 2 = 2\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Rearrange to find \\( r \\):**\n   \\[\n   r = 2m + 4\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:** This relationship indicates that the number of rows is always 4 more than twice the number of members per row. It serves as a constraint to find possible integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Finding Integer Solutions: Checking Constraints**\n\n**Objective:** We need integer values for \\( r \\) and \\( m \\) such that:\n\n- \\( r = 2m + 4 \\)\n- \\( r \\times m \\leq 98 \\) (since \\( n < 100 \\) and \\( n = r \\times m + 2 \\))\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Substitute \\( r \\) in terms of \\( m \\) into \\( r \\times m \\leq 98 \\):**\n   \\[\n   m(2m + 4) \\leq 98\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Expand the inequality:**\n   \\[\n   2m^2 + 4m \\leq 98\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Rearrange:**\n   \\[\n   2m^2 + 4m - 98 \\leq 0\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Simplify by dividing all terms by 2:**\n   \\[\n   m^2 + 2m - 49 \\leq 0\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:** This is a quadratic inequality. To find feasible integer values for \\( m \\), I'll need to solve the corresponding quadratic equation and determine where the inequality holds.\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Quadratic Inequality: Identifying Valid \\( m \\) Values**\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Find the roots of the equation \\( m^2 + 2m - 49 = 0 \\):**\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-49)}}{2 \\times 1}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 196}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{200}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{-2 \\pm 10\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   m \\approx -8.07 \\text{ or } m \\approx 6.07\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:** Since \\( m \\) must be a positive integer, feasible values for \\( m \\) are 6 or lower integers that satisfy the inequality.\n\n2. **Checking integer values of \\( m \\):**\n\n   - **For \\( m = 6 \\):**\n     \\[\n     r = 2(6) + 4 = 16\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     r \\times m = 16 \\times 6 = 96 \\leq 98\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n = 96 + 2 = 98\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (r - 2) \\times (m + 1) = 14 \\times 7 = 98\n     \\]\n     \n     **Conclusion:** This satisfies all conditions!\n\n   - **For \\( m = 5 \\):**\n     \\[\n     r = 2(5) + 4 = 14\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     r \\times m = 14 \\times 5 = 70 \\leq 98\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n = 70 + 2 = 72\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (r - 2) \\times (m + 1) = 12 \\times 6 = 72\n     \\]\n     \n     **Conclusion:** This also satisfies the conditions, but yields a smaller total number of members.\n\n**Reflection:** Since \\( m = 6 \\) gives the largest possible \\( n \\) under the constraints, it\u2019s the optimal solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer: Confirming the Solution**\n\n<ANSWER> solution98</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Reflection:** After exploring different strategies\u2014starting with sample scenarios, then setting up and solving algebraic equations, and finally validating integer solutions\u2014I conclude that the largest number of band members satisfying all conditions is **98**.\n\n---\n\n### **Wait a Moment\u2014Is This Correct? Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:** Initially, I considered that there might be multiple valid solutions, but after thoroughly checking integer values of \\( m \\) and ensuring all constraints are satisfied, \\( m = 6 \\) and \\( r = 16 \\) provide the largest possible \\( n = 98 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:** No larger feasible solution exists within the given constraints, confirming that **98** is indeed the correct and maximum number of band members.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Coherence and Completeness**\n\n**Reviewing the Process:**\n\n1. **Sample Scenarios:** Helped confirm the necessity of having two members left over.\n2. **Algebraic Approach:** Successfully set up and solved equations to find relationships between variables.\n3. **Quadratic Inequality:** Narrowed down feasible integer solutions for \\( m \\).\n4. **Validation:** Tested integer values to ensure all conditions were met, leading to the optimal solution.\n\n**Final Reflection:** The structured approach\u2014starting from brainstorming, testing samples, applying algebra, and validating solutions\u2014ensured a comprehensive and accurate solution, confirming that the largest number of band members is **98**.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>solution98</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\\boxed{98}$."
