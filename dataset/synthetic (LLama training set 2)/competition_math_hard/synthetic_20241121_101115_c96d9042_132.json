  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like how I'd approach it in real life. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking for correctness along the way. If something doesn't work, I'll back up and try a different approach.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question involves a sector of a circle and an inscribed circle that's tangent at three points. Immediately, this reminds me of problems involving **incircles** or **inscribed circles** touching multiple sides or arcs. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Let's brainstorm some strategies:\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Use geometric properties of circles, like tangents and radii.\n- **Strategy 2:** Apply trigonometry since it's a quarter circle.\n- **Strategy 3:** Consider using similarity of triangles or other shapes within the sector.\n\nHmm, I think exploring multiple strategies is essential. If one doesn't work, I can always pivot to another.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n**1. Using Geometric Properties:**\n\nMy initial thought is to leverage the properties of tangents and radii. I know that the radius to a point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent. Maybe I can use this to set up some equations.\n\n**2. Applying Trigonometry:**\n\nSince it's a quarter circle, perhaps angles play a role. I could try using sine or cosine to relate the lengths.\n\n**3. Similarity of Triangles:**\n\nIf there are triangles formed within the sector, maybe they're similar, and I can use proportionality.\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards the first strategy\u2014using geometric properties\u2014because it feels most direct. But I'll keep the others in mind just in case.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**\n\nLet's start by visualizing the problem. We have:\n\n- A sector \\(OAB\\) that's a quarter of a circle with radius 3 cm.\n- An inscribed circle tangent at three points: likely tangent to both radii \\(OA\\) and \\(OB\\) and the arc \\(AB\\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014since it's a quarter circle, the angle at \\(O\\) is \\(90^\\circ\\). This might simplify things because the inscribed circle will be tangent to both radii and the arc.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis reminds me of the concept of an **incircle** in right-angled sectors. The inscribed circle would be tangent to both the radii and the arc. Maybe I can use this to find the radius.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Drawing the Diagram**\n\nLet's draw a rough sketch to better understand:\n\n```\n   B\n   |\\\n   | \\\n   |  \\\n   |   \\\n   |    O\nA ------> \n```\n\n- The sector is \\(OAB\\) with \\(OA\\) and \\(OB\\) as radii.\n- The inscribed circle touches \\(OA\\), \\(OB\\), and the arc \\(AB\\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nHaving a visual helps. The circle is tangent at three points\u2014two on the radii and one on the arc. This symmetry might be useful.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, in a quarter circle, the inscribed circle would naturally be tangent at these points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Strategy 1 - Geometric Properties**\n\nLet's proceed with the first strategy: using the properties of tangents and radii.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- The center of the inscribed circle lies along the angle bisector of \\(90^\\circ\\).\n- The radius of the inscribed circle (\\(r\\)) is perpendicular to the tangents at the points of contact.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nWait, if the center lies on the angle bisector, it must be equidistant from both \\(OA\\) and \\(OB\\). This forms a right-angled isosceles triangle.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems promising. I can probably set up a relationship between the radius of the sector and the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\(O\\) as the center of the sector.\n- \\(P\\) as the center of the inscribed circle.\n- \\(r\\) as the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nSince \\(P\\) lies along the angle bisector of \\(90^\\circ\\), the distance from \\(O\\) to \\(P\\) is \\(R - r\\), where \\(R\\) is the radius of the sector (3 cm).\n\n\\[\nOP = R - r = 3 - r\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nSo, \\(OP = 3 - r\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because the inscribed circle's center is offset by its radius from the origin.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nNow, since \\(P\\) lies along the angle bisector, we can form a right triangle with:\n\n- One leg along \\(OA\\) or \\(OB\\).\n- The other leg along \\(OP\\).\n\nThe legs of this triangle are \\(3 - r\\) each, and the hypotenuse is \\(OP\\).\n\n\\[\nOP = \\sqrt{(3 - r)^2 + (3 - r)^2} = (3 - r) \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, \\(OP\\) is already \\(3 - r\\). So,\n\n\\[\n(3 - r) \\sqrt{2} = 3 - r\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nHold on\u2014this equation only holds if \\(\\sqrt{2} = 1\\), which is impossible. Something's off here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI must have made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me rethink this.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLooking back, I realize that I incorrectly equated the hypotenuse to \\(OP\\) without considering the scaling factor. I need to account for the angle bisector correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Correcting the Approach**\n\nLet's correct that. The center \\(P\\) lies along the angle bisector, so the coordinates of \\(P\\) are \\((r, r)\\) because it's equidistant from both axes.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nAh, that makes more sense. Now, I can use the fact that \\(P\\) lies at a distance \\(R - r\\) from \\(O\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this align with the geometry? Yes, it does.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Using Coordinate Geometry**\n\nAssign coordinates:\n\n- \\(O\\) is at \\((0, 0)\\).\n- \\(A\\) is at \\((3, 0)\\).\n- \\(B\\) is at \\((0, 3)\\).\n- \\(P\\) is at \\((r, r)\\).\n\nThe distance \\(OP = R - r = 3 - r\\).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{r^2 + r^2} = 3 - r \n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2}r = 3 - r \n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis equation looks correct now. I can solve for \\(r\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes the math hold up? Let's solve it to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Solving for \\( r \\)**\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2}r + r = 3 \n\\]\n\\[\nr(\\sqrt{2} + 1) = 3 \n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2} + 1} \n\\]\n\nBut I need to express this in the simplest radical form. Let's rationalize the denominator.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nIt's been a while since I rationalized denominators, but I remember multiplying by the conjugate.\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs this the correct approach? Yes, multiplying by the conjugate should simplify it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Rationalizing the Denominator**\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{2} - 1\\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3(\\sqrt{2} - 1)}{(\\sqrt{2} + 1)(\\sqrt{2} - 1)} \n\\]\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2} + 1)(\\sqrt{2} - 1) = 2 - 1 = 1 \n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nr = 3(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nWait, that simplifies nicely! The denominator becomes 1, so the expression is clean.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, the calculations are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Validating the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify if this solution makes sense geometrically.\n\n- The calculated radius \\(r = 3(\\sqrt{2} - 1)\\).\n- Numerically, \\(\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\\), so \\(\\sqrt{2} - 1 \\approx 0.414\\).\n- Therefore, \\(r \\approx 3 \\times 0.414 \\approx 1.242\\) cm.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis seems reasonable\u2014it's less than the original radius of 3 cm, which makes sense for an inscribed circle.\n\n**Check:**\n\nNo contradictions or inconsistencies are apparent. The value aligns with the geometric constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Final Reflection**\n\nLooking back, starting with the geometric properties was the right approach. Although I made an initial mistake in setting up the equation, correcting it led me to the correct solution.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n- **Always double-check equations:** Catching the error early prevented more significant issues later.\n- **Visual aids are helpful:** Drawing the diagram clarified the relationships between the elements.\n- **Alternative strategies are valuable:** Even though the first strategy worked, having backups ensured I had multiple paths to explore.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing geometric relationships and being open to adjusting strategies when inconsistencies arise.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Solution**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\n\\[\nr = 3(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nThere you have it! By methodically working through the problem, reflecting on each step, and being willing to correct mistakes, I arrived at the correct solution: the radius of the inscribed circle is \\(3(\\sqrt{2} - 1)\\) cm.",
  "ground_truth": "Call the center of the inscribed circle $C$, and let $D$ be the point shared by arc $AB$ and the inscribed circle.  Let $E$ and $F$ be the points where the inscribed circle is tangent to $OA$ and $OB$ respectively.  Since angles $CEO$, $CFO$, and $EOF$ are all right angles, angle $FCE$ is a right angle as well.  Therefore, the measure of angle $DCE$ is $(360-90)/2=135$ degrees.  By symmetry, angles $ECO$ and $FCO$ are congruent, so each measures 45 degrees.  Therefore, angle $DCO$ measures $135+45=180$ degrees, which implies $DC+CO=OD$.  Also, $DC=r$, and $CO=r\\sqrt{2}$, since triangle $CEO$ is an isosceles right triangle. Since $OD$ is a radius of the circle centered at $O$, we may set $DC+CO=r+r\\sqrt{2}$ equal to 3 cm to find \\[\nr=\\frac{3\\text{ cm}}{\\sqrt{2}+1}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{\\sqrt{2}-1}=\\boxed{3\\sqrt{2}-3}\\text{ centimeters}.\n\\]\n\n[asy]\nimport olympiad; import geometry; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\ndraw(Arc(origin,3,90,180));\ndraw((-3,0)--(origin)--(0,3));\nreal x = 3/(1 + sqrt(2));\ndraw(Circle((-x,x),x)); label(\"$B$\",(0,3),N); label(\"$A$\",(-3,0),W);\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),SE); draw((0,0)--(-3,0));\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-x,x),NE); label(\"$D$\",(-3/sqrt(2),3/sqrt(2)),NW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",(0,x),E); label(\"$E$\",(-x,0),S);\ndraw((-x,0)--(-x,x)--(0,x));\ndraw((-x,x)--(-3/sqrt(2),3/sqrt(2)));\ndraw((-x,x)--origin,linetype(\"1 2\"));[/asy]"
