  "solution": "Alright, let's put everything together into a smooth, coherent solution while maintaining the original thought process and reflections. I'll ensure it reads naturally, like someone walking through their problem-solving journey step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, let's dive into this. The challenge is to determine how many different automobile license plates are possible given a specific format:\n\n- **Format:** Four letters, a dash, followed by two digits (e.g., `ABCD-12`).\n- **Constraints:**\n  - **Exactly one letter is repeated exactly once.**\n  - **Digits cannot be repeated.**\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of combinatorics problems I've tackled before\u2014specifically dealing with permutations and combinations involving repeated elements. But honestly, it's been a while, so I might need to brainstorm a bit to recall the right approach.\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Simple Permutation Approach:**\n   - Calculate total permutations of letters with one repeat.\n   - Then, calculate permutations of digits without repeats.\n\n2. **Sequential Slot Filling:**\n   - Assign slots for letters and digits.\n   - Determine how to fill these slots considering the constraints.\n\n3. **Combination with Repeated Elements:**\n   - Use combinations to select which letter repeats and where.\n   - Similarly, select which digits are used.\n\nHmm, the **Simple Permutation Approach** seems straightforward, but I need to be careful with accounting for the repeated letter. The **Sequential Slot Filling** might help visualize the problem better. Let's start there and see if it makes sense.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Letter Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI need to arrange four letters where exactly one letter is repeated once. This means three unique letters, and one of them appears twice.\n\n**Approach:**  \n- **Choose the Letter to Repeat:** First, select which letter will be repeated.\n- **Arrange the Letters:** Then, arrange the four letters accounting for the repeat.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Choosing the Repeated Letter:**\n   - There are 26 letters in the alphabet.\n   - So, I have 26 choices for which letter will repeat.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Choices for repeated letter} = 26\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choosing the Remaining Unique Letters:**\n   - After selecting the repeated letter, I need to pick 2 more unique letters from the remaining 25.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\binom{25}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 24}{2} = 300\n   \\]\n   \n   Wait a minute... This seems correct because I'm choosing 2 unique letters out of the remaining 25.\n\n3. **Arranging the Letters:**\n   - The total number of ways to arrange four letters where one is repeated is given by the formula for permutations with repetition:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{4!}{2!} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   So far, it makes sense. I have 26 choices for the repeated letter, 300 ways to choose the other two unique letters, and 12 ways to arrange them. Let\u2019s multiply these together to get the total number of letter combinations.\n\n4. **Total Letter Combinations:**\n   \n   \\[\n   26 \\times 300 \\times 12 = 93,600\n   \\]\n   \n   **Quick Check:**  \n   That\u2019s a large number, but considering the vast number of possible letter combinations, it seems reasonable. I\u2019ll proceed with this.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Digit Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to arrange two digits with no repeats. This is a simpler problem since there are only 10 digits (0-9).\n\n**Approach:**  \n- Choose the first digit.\n- Choose a different second digit.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Choosing the First Digit:**\n   - There are 10 possible digits.\n   \n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ choices}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choosing the Second Digit:**\n   - The second digit must be different from the first, so there are 9 remaining choices.\n   \n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ choices}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Digit Combinations:**\n   \n   \\[\n   10 \\times 9 = 90\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   This makes sense. For each choice of the first digit, there are nine possible choices for the second digit, leading to 90 total combinations.\n\n### **Step 3: Combining Letters and Digits**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFinally, to find the total number of license plate combinations, I need to multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n93,600 \\times 90 = 8,424,000\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat\u2019s a substantial number, but considering the constraints and the format of the license plates, it seems plausible. I\u2019ll do a quick sanity check to ensure everything adds up.\n\n### **Sanity Check: Verifying the Approach**\n\n- **Letter Combinations:**  \n  - Repeated Letter: 26 choices\n  - Unique Letters: 300 ways to choose 2 out of 25\n  - Arrangements: 12 ways to arrange four letters with one repeat\n  - Total: \\(26 \\times 300 \\times 12 = 93,600\\)\n\n- **Digit Combinations:**  \n  - First Digit: 10 choices\n  - Second Digit: 9 choices (no repeat)\n  - Total: \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\)\n\n- **Overall Total:**  \n  - \\(93,600 \\times 90 = 8,424,000\\)\n\n**Quick Thought:**  \nEverything checks out. The numbers make sense, and the approach aligns with the problem\u2019s constraints. I feel confident in the solution.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>8,424,000 different license plate combinations are possible under the given constraints.</ANSWER>\n\n### **Wrapping Up**\n\nBy exploring different strategies and reflecting at each step, I ensured that the approach was correct and that the final answer made sense. Breaking down the problem into manageable parts and constantly checking for consistency led me to a reliable solution.\n\n**Note:** If at any point the numbers didn\u2019t add up or something seemed off, I would have revisited the steps to identify and correct any mistakes. But since everything aligned well, I\u2019m confident in the final answer.\n\n---\n\nThere you go! All the thoughts and reflections are seamlessly integrated to create a coherent and complete solution.",
