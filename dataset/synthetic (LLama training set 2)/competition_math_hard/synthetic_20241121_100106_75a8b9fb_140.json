  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem again. I'll keep my original ideas but be more mindful of where I went off track. I'll walk through my thought process just like before, making corrections along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The question asks for the least positive integer where deleting its leftmost digit results in a number that's \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\) of the original.\n- This reminds me of digit manipulation problems. I think I've dealt with similar ratios before, but not exactly \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\).\n- Honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to begin, but I know I need to relate the original number to its modified form.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Algebraic Approach:**\n   - Setting up an equation to represent the relationship between the original number and the modified one.\n\n2. **Trial and Error with Small Numbers:**\n   - Testing small integers to see if they satisfy the condition, but given the \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\) factor, it might take a while.\n\n3. **Digit Analysis:**\n   - Analyzing how deleting the leftmost digit affects the number's value.\n\n4. **Using Modular Arithmetic:**\n   - Considering if modular arithmetic could help, though I'm unsure if it's applicable here.\n\n**Reflecting on the Best Approach:**\n\n- Starting with the **Algebraic Approach** seems logical. It should provide a general formula, and I can switch to trial and error if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Algebraic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's denote the original integer as \\( N \\).\n- Deleting the leftmost digit transforms \\( N \\) into a new number \\( M \\).\n- According to the problem, \\( M = \\frac{1}{29}N \\).\n- I need to express \\( M \\) in terms of \\( N \\) by considering how removing the leftmost digit affects \\( N \\).\n\n**Developing the Equation:**\n\n- Suppose \\( N \\) has \\( p + 1 \\) digits.\n- The leftmost digit is \\( d \\), and the remaining number is \\( n \\) (i.e., \\( M = n \\)).\n- Therefore, \\( N = d \\times 10^p + n \\).\n- From the problem, \\( n = \\frac{1}{29}N \\).\n\n**Substituting \\( n \\):**\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1}{29} (d \\times 10^p + n)\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n29n = d \\times 10^p + n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n28n = d \\times 10^p\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{d \\times 10^p}{28}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait a minute, this equation tells me that \\( n \\) must be an integer.\n- This means \\( \\frac{d \\times 10^p}{28} \\) has to be an integer.\n- So, \\( d \\times 10^p \\) must be divisible by 28.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing Divisibility**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Given that \\( 10^p \\) is a power of 10, I need to see if it\u2019s divisible by 28.\n- I know that 28 factors into \\( 4 \\times 7 \\).\n- \\( 10^p \\) is always divisible by 4 for \\( p \\geq 2 \\), so I only need to ensure divisibility by 7.\n\n**Calculating the Smallest \\( p \\) Such That \\( 10^p \\) Is Divisible by 7:**\n\n- Let\u2019s find the smallest \\( p \\) where \\( 10^p \\mod 7 = 0 \\):\n  - \\( 10^1 = 10 \\mod 7 = 3 \\)\n  - \\( 10^2 = 100 \\mod 7 = 2 \\)\n  - \\( 10^3 = 1000 \\mod 7 = 6 \\)\n  - \\( 10^4 = 10000 \\mod 7 = 4 \\)\n  - \\( 10^5 = 100000 \\mod 7 = 5 \\)\n  - \\( 10^6 = 1000000 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n- So, \\( 10^6 \\mod 7 = 1 \\), meaning \\( 10^6 \\) is divisible by 7.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Therefore, \\( p = 6 \\).\n- This implies that \\( N \\) must have \\( p + 1 = 7 \\) digits.\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\n\n- **Actually, looking at this again**, I see that assuming \\( p = 6 \\) might lead to a larger number than necessary. Maybe there's a more straightforward way to find the smallest \\( N \\).\n- Hmm, **let me double-check my reasoning here**. Perhaps I need to find the smallest \\( p \\) where \\( 10^p \\) is divisible by both 4 and 7.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( d \\) and \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- From the equation \\( n = \\frac{d \\times 10^p}{28} \\), \\( n \\) must be an integer.\n- Therefore, \\( d \\times 10^p \\) must be divisible by 28.\n- Since \\( d \\) is a single digit (1 to 9), I need to find the smallest \\( d \\) such that \\( d \\times 10^p \\) is divisible by 28.\n\n**Realizing the Need for a Specific \\( d \\):**\n\n- **Wait, I think I see where I went wrong earlier.** I assumed \\( p = 6 \\) without considering smaller values of \\( p \\).\n- **Actually, looking at this again**, I realize that I need to find the smallest \\( p \\) and corresponding \\( d \\) to minimize \\( N \\).\n- **Hmm, let me double-check my reasoning here**. I should explore smaller values of \\( p \\) to find the least \\( N \\).\n\n**Exploring Smaller \\( p \\):**\n\n- Let's try \\( p = 2 \\):\n  - \\( 10^p = 100 \\)\n  - So, \\( d \\times 100 \\) must be divisible by 28.\n  - Therefore, \\( d \\) must be \\( \\frac{28}{\\text{GCD}(28, 100)} = \\frac{28}{4} = 7 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Oh! This reminds me of** needing to find the smallest \\( d \\) that makes \\( n \\) an integer.\n- With \\( d = 7 \\) and \\( p = 2 \\), let's calculate \\( N \\) and \\( n \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating \\( N \\) and \\( n \\)**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Given \\( d = 7 \\) and \\( p = 2 \\):\n  - \\( N = d \\times 10^p + n = 7 \\times 100 + n = 700 + n \\)\n  - From earlier, \\( 28n = d \\times 10^p = 7 \\times 100 = 700 \\)\n  - Therefore, \\( n = \\frac{700}{28} = 25 \\)\n\n**Final Computation:**\n\n- \\( N = 700 + 25 = 725 \\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Deleting the leftmost digit from 725 gives 25.\n- Check if \\( 25 = \\frac{1}{29} \\times 725 \\):\n  - \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\times 725 = 25 \\)\n- **That number seems too big...**  \n  - Wait, no, **actually, it checks out!**  \n  - **Let me think about whether this approach makes sense...** Yes, it does.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>725</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Wrap-Up:**\n\n- By re-evaluating my initial assumptions and exploring smaller values of \\( p \\), I found that \\( p = 2 \\) and \\( d = 7 \\) yield the least positive integer \\( N = 725 \\) that satisfies the condition.\n- This approach ensured that \\( N \\) was minimized while still meeting the problem's requirements.\n- **Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...** No, I think this approach is correct now.\n\n---\n\n### Putting It All Together\n\nLet's consolidate the entire thought process into a coherent and complete solution, maintaining the original steps, reflections, and corrections.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n- **First Thoughts:**  \n  The problem asks for the smallest positive integer \\( N \\) such that deleting its leftmost digit results in a number that's \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\) of the original. Initially, I'm reminded of digit manipulation problems but unsure of where to start.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**  \n  Considering different approaches:\n  1. **Algebraic Approach:** Setting up an equation.\n  2. **Trial and Error:** Testing small numbers.\n  3. **Digit Analysis:** Understanding the effect of removing a digit.\n  4. **Modular Arithmetic:** Maybe useful, but not certain.\n\n- **Reflecting on the Best Approach:**  \n  Deciding to begin with the **Algebraic Approach** to establish a general relationship between \\( N \\) and its modified form.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Algebraic Equation**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Let's denote the original integer as \\( N \\) and the number after deleting the leftmost digit as \\( M \\). According to the problem, \\( M = \\frac{1}{29}N \\). I need to express \\( M \\) in terms of \\( N \\).\n\n- **Developing the Equation:**  \n  Suppose \\( N \\) has \\( p + 1 \\) digits. Let \\( d \\) be the leftmost digit, and \\( n \\) the remaining number after deleting \\( d \\). Therefore,\n  \\[\n  N = d \\times 10^p + n\n  \\]\n  Given \\( M = n = \\frac{1}{29}N \\), substituting \\( n \\):\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{1}{29} (d \\times 10^p + n)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying:**  \n  Rearranging the equation,\n  \\[\n  29n = d \\times 10^p + n \\implies 28n = d \\times 10^p \\implies n = \\frac{d \\times 10^p}{28}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  This tells me that \\( n \\) must be an integer, so \\( \\frac{d \\times 10^p}{28} \\) needs to be an integer. Therefore, \\( d \\times 10^p \\) must be divisible by 28.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing Divisibility**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Given \\( 10^p \\) is a power of 10, I need to check if it's divisible by 28. Since 28 factors into \\( 4 \\times 7 \\), and \\( 10^p \\) is always divisible by 4 for \\( p \\geq 2 \\), I only need to ensure divisibility by 7.\n\n- **Calculating the Smallest \\( p \\) Such That \\( 10^p \\) Is Divisible by 7:**  \n  Let's find the smallest \\( p \\) where \\( 10^p \\mod 7 = 0 \\):\n  - \\( 10^1 \\mod 7 = 3 \\)\n  - \\( 10^2 \\mod 7 = 2 \\)\n  - \\( 10^3 \\mod 7 = 6 \\)\n  - \\( 10^4 \\mod 7 = 4 \\)\n  - \\( 10^5 \\mod 7 = 5 \\)\n  - \\( 10^6 \\mod 7 = 1 \\)\n  \n  So, \\( 10^6 \\) is divisible by 7.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Therefore, \\( p = 6 \\), implying that \\( N \\) must have \\( p + 1 = 7 \\) digits.\n\n- **Wait a Minute:**  \n  **Actually, looking at this again**, I realize that assuming \\( p = 6 \\) might lead to a larger number than necessary. Perhaps there's a more straightforward way to find the smallest \\( N \\) by considering smaller values of \\( p \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( d \\) and \\( n \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  From the equation \\( n = \\frac{d \\times 10^p}{28} \\), \\( n \\) must be an integer. Therefore, \\( d \\times 10^p \\) must be divisible by 28. Since \\( d \\) is a single digit (1 to 9), I need to find the smallest \\( d \\) and \\( p \\) that satisfy this condition.\n\n- **Realizing the Need for a Specific \\( d \\):**  \n  **Wait, I think I see where I went wrong earlier.** I assumed \\( p = 6 \\) without considering smaller values of \\( p \\). **Actually, looking at this again**, I need to explore smaller \\( p \\) to minimize \\( N \\).\n\n- **Exploring Smaller \\( p \\):**  \n  Let's try \\( p = 2 \\):\n  - \\( 10^p = 100 \\)\n  - So, \\( d \\times 100 \\) must be divisible by 28.\n  - Therefore, \\( d \\) must be \\( \\frac{28}{\\text{GCD}(28, 100)} = \\frac{28}{4} = 7 \\).\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  **Oh! This reminds me of** needing to find the smallest \\( d \\) that makes \\( n \\) an integer. With \\( d = 7 \\) and \\( p = 2 \\), let's calculate \\( N \\) and \\( n \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating \\( N \\) and \\( n \\)**\n\n- **Calculations:**  \n  Given \\( d = 7 \\) and \\( p = 2 \\):\n  \\[\n  N = d \\times 10^p + n = 7 \\times 100 + n = 700 + n\n  \\]\n  From earlier,\n  \\[\n  28n = d \\times 10^p = 7 \\times 100 = 700 \\implies n = \\frac{700}{28} = 25\n  \\]\n  \n- **Final Computation:**  \n  \\[\n  N = 700 + 25 = 725\n  \\]\n  \n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Deleting the leftmost digit from 725 gives 25. Check if \\( 25 = \\frac{1}{29} \\times 725 \\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{29} \\times 725 = 25\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  **That number seems too big...**  \n  Wait, no, **actually, it checks out!**  \n  **Let me think about whether this approach makes sense...** Yes, it does. The calculations are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{725}\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Wrap-Up**\n\n- **By re-evaluating my initial assumptions** and exploring smaller values of \\( p \\), I found that \\( p = 2 \\) and \\( d = 7 \\) yield the least positive integer \\( N = 725 \\) that satisfies the condition.\n- **This approach ensured** that \\( N \\) was minimized while still meeting the problem's requirements.\n- **Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...** No, I think this approach is correct now.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Solution**\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the problem and correcting my initial assumptions, I determined that the least positive integer \\( N \\) is **725**. This solution was achieved by:\n\n1. **Setting Up an Algebraic Equation:**  \n   Establishing the relationship between \\( N \\) and its modified form \\( M \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing Divisibility:**  \n   Ensuring that \\( d \\times 10^p \\) is divisible by 28 to make \\( n \\) an integer.\n\n3. **Exploring Smaller Values of \\( p \\):**  \n   Identifying that \\( p = 2 \\) and \\( d = 7 \\) yield the smallest \\( N \\).\n\n4. **Calculating \\( N \\) and \\( n \\):**  \n   Computing \\( N = 725 \\) and verifying that deleting the leftmost digit satisfies the given condition.\n\nBy maintaining a reflective approach and correcting assumptions along the way, the solution was accurately reached.",
  "ground_truth": "The desired integer has at least two digits.  Let $d$ be its leftmost digit, and let $n$ be the integer that results when $d$ is deleted.  Then for some positive integer $p$, $10^p\\cdot\nd+n=29n$, and so $10^p\\cdot d=28n$. Therefore 7 is a divisor of $d$, and because $1\\le d\\le9$, it follows that $d=7$. Hence $10^p=4n$, so $\\displaystyle n={{10^p}\\over4}=\n{{100\\cdot10^{p-2}}\\over4}=25\\cdot10^{p-2}$.  Thus every positive integer with the desired property must be of the form $7\\cdot10^p+25\\cdot10^{p-2}=10^{p-2}(7\\cdot10^2+25)=725\\cdot10^{p-2}$ for some $p\\ge2$. The smallest such integer is $\\boxed{725}$."
