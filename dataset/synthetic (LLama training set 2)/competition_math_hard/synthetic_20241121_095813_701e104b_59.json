  "solution": "Certainly! Let's craft a clear, coherent solution by reflecting on each step, ensuring correctness, and maintaining the final answer. I'll preserve the original thought process while enhancing clarity and flow.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution: Tackling the Problem Step by Step**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem as if I'm solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to ensure I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks to find an integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 0 \\le n < 31 \\) and \\( 3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\). Essentially, I need to find the **modular inverse** of 3 modulo 31. Once I have \\( n \\), I\u2019ll compute \\( \\left(2^n\\right)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\) and express the final answer as an integer between 0 and 30.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This looks like a two-part problem: first, find \\( n \\), and then compute the expression involving \\( n \\).\n- For finding \\( n \\), I\u2019m considering using the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** or **Trial and Error** since \\( n \\) is within a small range.\n- Once \\( n \\) is determined, calculating \\( \\left(2^n\\right)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\) can be done using **Modular Exponentiation** to handle large exponents efficiently.\n\n**Reflection:** Hmm, starting with finding \\( n \\) seems logical. If that part isn't straightforward, I might need to reconsider my approach. But let's proceed and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding \\( n \\) such that \\( 3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\)**\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Trial and Error:** Manually checking each \\( n \\) from 0 to 30 could work given the small range.\n2. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm:** This method should directly yield the inverse.\n3. **Using Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem:** Since 31 is prime, properties of modular inverses might help.\n\n**Reflection:** Trial and error might be straightforward but time-consuming. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm seems more efficient and methodical. Let's try that first.\n\n**Proceeding with the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**\n\nI need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( 3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\). This means finding the inverse of 3 modulo 31.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Use the Euclidean algorithm to express 1 as a linear combination of 3 and 31.\n- Once I have that expression, the coefficient of 3 will be the inverse I'm looking for.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. **Perform the Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   \n   \\[\n   31 = 3 \\times 10 + 1 \\\\\n   3 = 1 \\times 3 + 0\n   \\]\n   \n   - The GCD is 1, which means 3 and 31 are coprime, so an inverse exists.\n\n2. **Back Substitution to Find Inverse:**\n   \n   From the first equation:\n   \n   \\[\n   1 = 31 - 3 \\times 10\n   \\]\n   \n   So,\n   \n   \\[\n   1 = 31 - 3 \\times 10\n   \\]\n   \n   This tells me that \\( 3 \\times (-10) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\).\n\n3. **Adjusting to Positive \\( n \\):**\n   \n   But \\( n \\) needs to be non-negative within \\( 0 \\leq n < 31 \\). So, I add 31 to -10:\n   \n   \\[\n   n = -10 + 31 = 21\n   \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet me verify this:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 21 = 63 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}\n\\]\n\nYes! \\( 63 - 31 \\times 2 = 63 - 62 = 1 \\). So, \\( n = 21 \\) is correct.\n\n**Reflection:** The Extended Euclidean Algorithm worked smoothly. Moving on to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating \\( \\left(2^n\\right)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\) with \\( n = 21 \\)**\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nNow, I need to compute \\( \\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\). That exponent looks pretty large, so I should definitely use **Modular Exponentiation** to make this manageable.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Computation:** Calculating \\( 2^{63} \\) directly seems impractical due to the large size.\n2. **Modular Exponentiation:** Using techniques like **Exponentiation by Squaring** to compute powers modulo 31 efficiently.\n3. **Properties of Exponents:** Simplifying the expression before computing.\n\n**Reflection:** Direct computation is not feasible. Modular Exponentiation seems like the best approach here. Let\u2019s go with that.\n\n**Proceeding with Modular Exponentiation:**\n\nI\u2019ll use exponentiation by squaring to compute \\( 2^{63} \\mod 31 \\), since \\( \\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 = 2^{63} \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. **Compute \\( 2^{21} \\mod 31 \\):**\n\n   - Break down \\( 21 \\) into powers of 2:\n     \n     \\[\n     21 = 16 + 4 + 1 = 2^4 + 2^2 + 2^0\n     \\]\n   \n   - Compute successive squares of 2 modulo 31:\n   \n     \\[\n     2^1 = 2 \\\\\n     2^2 = 4 \\\\\n     2^4 = 16 \\\\\n     2^8 = 256 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{31} \\, (\\text{since } 256 - 31 \\times 8 = 256 - 248 = 8) \\\\\n     2^{16} = 8 \\times 8 = 64 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{31} \\, (\\text{since } 64 - 31 \\times 2 = 64 - 62 = 2)\n     \\]\n   \n   - Now, multiply the relevant powers:\n   \n     \\[\n     2^{21} = 2^{16} \\times 2^4 \\times 2^1 = 2 \\times 16 \\times 2 = 64 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{31}\n     \\]\n     \n     **Reflection:** Wait a minute, that doesn\u2019t seem right. If \\( 2^{21} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{31} \\), it doesn't align with expectations. Let me think\u2014maybe there's a better way.\n\n2. **Alternative Approach: Using Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem:**\n\n   According to Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem, for a prime \\( p \\), \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\). Here, \\( p = 31 \\) and \\( a = 2 \\), so:\n   \n   \\[\n   2^{30} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}\n   \\]\n   \n   Therefore,\n   \n   \\[\n   2^{63} = 2^{30 \\times 2 + 3} = (2^{30})^2 \\times 2^3 \\equiv 1^2 \\times 2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{31}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:** This seems more reliable. Using Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem simplifies the computation significantly.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet me verify:\n\n\\[\n2^{30} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\\\\n2^{63} = 2^{30 \\times 2 + 3} \\equiv 1^2 \\times 2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{31}\n\\]\n\nYes, that checks out. So,\n\n\\[\n\\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 = 2^{63} \\equiv 8 \\pmod{31}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem made this step straightforward. Proceeding to the final calculation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Final Calculation \\( \\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31} \\)**\n\nNow, I need to compute:\n\n\\[\n\\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 - 2 \\equiv 8 - 2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{31}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Reflection:** That subtraction is straightforward. \\( 8 - 2 = 6 \\), and since 6 is already within the range 0 to 30, no further adjustment is needed.\n\n**Final Check:** \nLet me walk through the entire process again to ensure everything is correct:\n1. **Finding \\( n \\):**\n   - Used the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \\( n = 21 \\).\n   - Verified \\( 3 \\times 21 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31} \\).\n\n2. **Calculating \\( \\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 \\):**\n   - Applied Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem to simplify \\( 2^{63} \\equiv 8 \\pmod{31} \\).\n\n3. **Final Expression:**\n   - Computed \\( 8 - 2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{31} \\).\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n**Reflection:** Initially, attempting to compute \\( 2^{21} \\) directly led to confusion, but applying Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem simplified the process significantly. Checking each step ensured that any missteps were caught early, leading to a correct and efficient solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\nI found that \\( \\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 - 2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{31} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy methodically exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying calculations, I ensured the correctness of the solution. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm efficiently provided the modular inverse, and Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem facilitated handling large exponents modulo a prime, leading to the final answer of 6.",
  "ground_truth": "Since $21 \\cdot 3 = 63 = 2 \\cdot 31 + 1$, it follows that $21$ is the modular inverse of $3$, modulo $31$. Thus, $2^n \\equiv 2^{21} \\pmod{31}$. After computing some powers of $2$, we notice that $2^5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$, so $2^{21} \\equiv 2 \\cdot \\left(2^{5}\\right)^{4} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{31}$. Thus, $\\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{31}$, and $$\\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 - 2 \\equiv 8 - 2 \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{31}$$Notice that this problem implies that $\\left(a^{3^{-1}}\\right)^3 \\not\\equiv a \\pmod{p}$ in general, so that certain properties of modular inverses do not extend to exponentiation (for that, one needs to turn to Fermat's Little Theorem or other related theorems)."
