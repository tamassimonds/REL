  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, okay. We're dealing with reflections of a point across various lines, eventually forming a pentagon with a given area. Initially, this reminds me of problems involving symmetry and geometric transformations. I think understanding how each reflection affects the coordinates will be crucial. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to connect the reflections directly to the area right off the bat. \n\nTo brainstorm, let\u2019s consider different strategies:\n\n1. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:** Track each reflection's impact on coordinates and compute the area using coordinate geometry formulas.\n   \n2. **Visualizing Symmetry:** Consider the symmetry properties to possibly simplify the problem.\n\n3. **Vector Approach:** Use vectors to handle reflections and area calculations.\n\nI'm inclined to start with the **Coordinate Geometry Approach** since it seems straightforward to track each step. If it gets too complicated, I can reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Coordinate Geometry Approach**\n\n#### **Step 1: Understanding the Reflections**\n\nLet\u2019s break down each reflection one by one to see how the coordinates change.\n\n- **Point A:** \\( A = (u, v) \\)\n  \n- **Reflection Across \\( y = x \\):**  \n  Reflecting across \\( y = x \\) swaps the coordinates.  \n  So, **Point B:** \\( B = (v, u) \\)\n\n- **Reflection Across the y-axis:**  \n  This changes the x-coordinate's sign.  \n  So, **Point C:** \\( C = (-v, u) \\)\n\n- **Reflection Across the x-axis:**  \n  This changes the y-coordinate's sign.  \n  So, **Point D:** \\( D = (-v, -u) \\)\n\n- **Reflection Across the y-axis Again:**  \n  Changes the x-coordinate's sign back.  \n  So, **Point E:** \\( E = (v, -u) \\)\n\nOkay, so now we have all five points:  \n\\( A = (u, v), B = (v, u), C = (-v, u), D = (-v, -u), E = (v, -u) \\)\n\n#### **Reflection Moment**\n\nWait a minute\u2014looking at these points, it seems like the pentagon has a lot of symmetry. Maybe this symmetry can help simplify calculating the area. But for now, I'll proceed with computing the area using these coordinates to see if it leads me somewhere.\n\n#### **Step 2: Calculating the Area Using the Shoelace Formula**\n\nThe Shoelace Formula (or Gauss's area formula) is a reliable method for finding the area of a polygon given its vertices' coordinates.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum (x_i \\cdot y_{i+1}) - \\sum (y_i \\cdot x_{i+1}) \\right|\n\\]\n\nwhere the sums are cyclic over the vertices.\n\nLet\u2019s list the points in order:  \n\\( A, B, C, D, E \\)  \n\\( (u, v), (v, u), (-v, u), (-v, -u), (v, -u) \\)\n\nClosing the polygon by returning to the first point:  \n\\( A = (u, v) \\)\n\nPlug these into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Area} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \n(u \\cdot u) + (v \\cdot u) + (-v \\cdot -u) + (-v \\cdot -u) + (v \\cdot v) \\right. \\\\\n&\\quad \\left. - \\left( \n(v \\cdot v) + (u \\cdot -v) + (u \\cdot -v) + (-u \\cdot v) + (-u \\cdot u) \n\\right) \\right|\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Area} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \nu^2 + vu + vu + vu + v^2 \\right. \\\\\n&\\quad \\left. - \\left( \nv^2 - uv - uv - uv - u^2 \n\\right) \\right|\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \nu^2 + 3vu + v^2 - (v^2 - 3uv - u^2) \n\\right|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \nu^2 + 3uv + v^2 - v^2 + 3uv + u^2 \n\\right|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \n2u^2 + 6uv \n\\right|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} (2u^2 + 6uv) \n\\]\n\n\\[\n= u^2 + 3uv \n\\]\n\nSo, the area is \\( u^2 + 3uv \\).\n\n#### **Check Moment**\n\nWait, let me double-check this. Does it make sense? The area expression involves both \\( u^2 \\) and \\( uv \\), which aligns with the symmetry of the figure. No negative signs, which is good since the area should be positive. Okay, seems correct so far.\n\n#### **Step 3: Setting Up the Equation with Given Area**\n\nWe know the area of pentagon \\( ABCDE \\) is 451. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nu^2 + 3uv = 451\n\\]\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\). Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. But before jumping into solving, let's see if there's a more straightforward way.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Leveraging Symmetry**\n\nThinking back, the pentagon is highly symmetric. Perhaps I can find a relationship between \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) that simplifies the equation. Since \\( 0 < v < u \\), maybe expressing \\( v \\) as a fraction of \\( u \\) could help.\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\( v = k \\cdot u \\) where \\( 0 < k < 1 \\). This substitution might simplify things.\n\n#### **Step 4: Substituting \\( v = k \\cdot u \\) into the Equation**\n\nPlugging \\( v = k \\cdot u \\) into the area equation:\n\n\\[\nu^2 + 3u(k \\cdot u) = 451\n\\]\n\n\\[\nu^2 + 3ku^2 = 451\n\\]\n\n\\[\nu^2(1 + 3k) = 451\n\\]\n\n\\[\nu^2 = \\frac{451}{1 + 3k}\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection Moment**\n\nHmm, this seems to be leading somewhere. By expressing \\( u^2 \\) in terms of \\( k \\), I can find integer values that satisfy the equation. But I still need to find \\( k \\) such that both \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are integers.\n\nMaybe rearranging the equation to find \\( k \\) in terms of \\( u \\) could work better. Let's see.\n\n#### **Step 5: Solving for \\( k \\)**\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n\\[\nu^2(1 + 3k) = 451\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1 + 3k = \\frac{451}{u^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3k = \\frac{451}{u^2} - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{451 - u^2}{3u^2}\n\\]\n\nBut since \\( k \\) is a fraction, and \\( k = \\frac{v}{u} \\), this suggests that \\( v \\) must be an integer multiple of \\( u \\), which might complicate things.\n\n#### **Check Moment**\n\nWait, this path seems to be getting messy. I intended to simplify the relationship between \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), but it's not leading to a clear solution. Maybe assuming \\( v = k \\cdot u \\) isn't the best approach here.\n\n---\n\n### **Back to Strategy 1: Coordinate Geometry Approach**\n\nAlright, let's stick to the original strategy and try to solve the quadratic equation directly.\n\n\\[\nu^2 + 3uv = 451\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are integers with \\( 0 < v < u \\), I can look for integer solutions that satisfy this equation.\n\n#### **Step 6: Solving the Quadratic Equation for Integer Solutions**\n\nOne way to find integer solutions is to factor the equation or use trial and error with plausible integer values. Since \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are positive integers, and \\( u > v \\), I can start by assuming values for \\( u \\) and checking if \\( v \\) comes out to be an integer.\n\nBut to streamline this, let's rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\nu^2 + 3uv - 451 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( u \\). However, since both \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are integers, it's better to express \\( v \\) in terms of \\( u \\) or vice versa.\n\nLet's solve for \\( v \\) in terms of \\( u \\):\n\n\\[\n3uv = 451 - u^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{451 - u^2}{3u}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( v \\) to be an integer, \\( 451 - u^2 \\) must be divisible by \\( 3u \\). This condition can help narrow down possible values for \\( u \\).\n\n#### **Step 7: Finding Suitable Integer Values for \\( u \\)**\n\nGiven that \\( u \\) is a positive integer and \\( 0 < v < u \\), I need to find \\( u \\) such that \\( \\frac{451 - u^2}{3u} \\) is an integer.\n\nTo make this systematic, let\u2019s consider that \\( 451 - u^2 \\) must be divisible by \\( 3u \\). This gives us a constraint to work with.\n\nPerhaps factoring or looking for patterns could help. Alternatively, I can try factoring the quadratic equation.\n\n#### **Step 8: Factoring the Quadratic Equation**\n\nLet's attempt to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nu^2 + 3uv - 451 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring quadratics with two variables can be tricky, but maybe I can look for factors of 451 that relate to \\( u \\) and \\( v \\).\n\n451 is a prime number (since it's not divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root), which means factoring may not straightforwardly help here.\n\n#### **Reflection Moment**\n\nHmm, factoring doesn't seem to be leading anywhere useful since 451 is prime. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAn alternative approach could be to rearrange the equation to express \\( v \\) in terms of \\( u \\) and look for integer solutions that satisfy the inequality \\( 0 < v < u \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Rearranging and Inequality Constraints**\n\nLet's rearrange the equation again:\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{451 - u^2}{3u}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( 0 < v < u \\), we can set up the inequality:\n\n\\[\n0 < \\frac{451 - u^2}{3u} < u\n\\]\n\nThis inequality can perhaps be simplified to find constraints on \\( u \\).\n\n#### **Step 9: Simplifying the Inequality**\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( 3u \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n0 < 451 - u^2 < 3u^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n451 - u^2 > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 451 - u^2 < 3u^2\n\\]\n\nWhich further simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nu^2 < 451 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 451 < 4u^2\n\\]\n\n#### **Understanding the Constraints**\n\n1. **\\( u^2 < 451 \\):**  \n   This implies \\( u < \\sqrt{451} \\approx 21.23 \\). Since \\( u \\) must be an integer, \\( u \\leq 21 \\).\n\n2. **\\( 451 < 4u^2 \\):**  \n   This implies \\( u > \\sqrt{\\frac{451}{4}} \\approx 10.62 \\). Since \\( u \\) must be an integer, \\( u \\geq 11 \\).\n\nSo, \\( u \\) must be an integer between 11 and 21 inclusive.\n\n#### **Step 10: Narrowing Down Possible Values for \\( u \\)**\n\nNow, I need to find an integer \\( u \\) within this range such that \\( v = \\frac{451 - u^2}{3u} \\) is also an integer.\n\nThis still seems a bit abstract. Maybe listing out possible values or finding a pattern could help.\n\n#### **Reflection Moment**\n\nListing out each possible \\( u \\) and checking if \\( v \\) is an integer could be time-consuming but might be the most straightforward way to ensure correctness. Let\u2019s proceed with this method.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Listing Possible Values**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the smallest possible \\( u \\) and work our way up until we find a valid pair \\( (u, v) \\).\n\n#### **Attempt 1: \\( u = 11 \\)**\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{451 - 11^2}{3 \\times 11} = \\frac{451 - 121}{33} = \\frac{330}{33} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n\\( 0 < v < u \\)  \n\\( 0 < 10 < 11 \\) \u2014 Valid!\n\n**Wait, Really?**  \nDid I just find the solution on the first try? Let's double-check the area to confirm.\n\n#### **Step 11: Verifying the Solution**\n\nPlug \\( u = 11 \\) and \\( v = 10 \\) back into the area formula:\n\n\\[\nu^2 + 3uv = 11^2 + 3 \\times 11 \\times 10 = 121 + 330 = 451\n\\]\n\nYes, it matches the given area. So, \\( u = 11 \\) and \\( v = 10 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n#### **Check Moment**\n\nLet me pause and reflect. Does this make sense? The inequality \\( 0 < v < u \\) is satisfied, and the area calculation confirms the given value. Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Finding \\( u + v \\)**\n\n\\[\nu + v = 11 + 10 = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum \\( u + v \\) is **21**.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>21</ANSWER>\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and carefully checking each step, we found that \\( u = 11 \\) and \\( v = 10 \\), leading to \\( u + v = 21 \\).\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nIt\u2019s interesting how the first value tested turned out to be correct, but it's always important to verify by plugging back into the original equation. Initially considering multiple strategies helped ensure that the approach was robust, and systematically narrowing down the possible values ensured accuracy.\n\nBy reflecting at each stage and being open to changing strategies when needed, I was able to efficiently solve the problem while maintaining correctness.",

If we graph those points, we notice that since the latter four points are all reflected across the x/y-axis, they form a rectangle, and $ABE$ is a triangle. The area of $BCDE$ is $(2u)(2v) = 4uv$ and the area of $ABE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(2u)(u-v) = u^2 - uv$. Adding these together, we get $u^2 + 3uv = u(u+3v) = 451 = 11 \\cdot 41$. Since $u,v$ are positive, $u+3v>u$, and by matching factors we get either $(u,v) = (1,150)$ or $(11,10)$. Since $v < u$ the latter case is the answer, and $u+v = \\boxed{21}$."
