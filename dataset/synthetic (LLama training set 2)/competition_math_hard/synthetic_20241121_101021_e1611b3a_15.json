  "problem": "A license plate in a certain state consists of 4 digits, not necessarily distinct, and 2 letters, also not necessarily distinct. These six characters may appear in any order, except that the two letters must appear next to each other.  How many distinct license plates are possible?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem. I remember tackling it by thinking about treating the letters as a block, but it seems I overcounted somewhere. Let's walk through my original approach again, keeping the good insights and correcting where I went off track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem Again**\n\nOkay, we have a license plate with **4 digits** and **2 letters**, totaling **6 characters**. The key condition is that the **two letters must be next to each other**. This reminds me of grouping problems where certain elements stick together.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n- **Digits and Letters:** 10 possible digits (0-9) and 26 possible letters (A-Z).\n- **Letters Together:** Treating the letters as a single unit or \"block\" could simplify things.\n- **Ordering the Characters:** Need to arrange this block with the digits.\n\nBut wait, I remember thinking this might lead to overcounting. Let\u2019s explore different strategies to ensure I\u2019m accounting for all constraints correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies: Adjusting My Approach**\n\n#### **Original Strategy: Treating Letters as a Single Block**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nInitially, I treated the two letters as a single \"block,\" reducing the total units to 5 (4 digits + 1 letter block). This led me to calculate permutations of these blocks.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Arrange Blocks:** \\(5!\\) ways to arrange the 5 units.\n   \n   \\[\n   5! = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, I realize now that this only handles the arrangement of blocks, not the specific digits and letters. I need to account for the different combinations of digits and letters within their respective blocks.\n\n**Actually, Looking at This Again...**\n\nI\u2019m missing the internal arrangements of the letters and the specific choices for digits and letters. This approach is incomplete.\n\n---\n\n#### **Revised Strategy: Combining Block Arrangement with Character Selection**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to select which digits and letters fill their positions and account for the internal arrangement of the letters within their block.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Choose the Digits:**  \n   - 10 possible digits for each of the 4 positions.  \n   - Since digits can repeat:  \n     \n     \\[\n     10^4 = 10,000\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Choose the Letters:**  \n   - 26 possible letters for each of the 2 positions.  \n   - Since letters can repeat:  \n     \n     \\[\n     26^2 = 676\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Arrange the Blocks:**  \n   - 5 positions to fill: 4 digits + 1 letter block.  \n   - Number of ways:  \n     \n     \\[\n     5! = 120\n     \\]\n   \n**Combining It All:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Combinations} = 10,000 \\times 676 \\times 120 = 8,112,000,000\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute, I Think I See Where I Went Wrong...**\n\nThis number seems excessively large. By treating the letters as a single block but still multiplying by the total digit and letter combinations, I\u2019m overcounting. The letters being together should reduce the total permutations significantly.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflecting and Correcting the Overcount**\n\n#### **New Strategy: Properly Accounting for the Letters Being Together**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nInstead of treating the letters as always being a single block in all arrangements, I should only consider the cases where the letters are indeed together. This means adjusting the way I calculate the total permutations.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Think of the Letters as a Two-Letter Word:**  \n   - The two letters form a unit, like a \"word\" \\(w\\).\n   \n2. **Total Units to Arrange:**  \n   - 4 digits + 1 letter block (\\(w\\)) = 5 units.\n   \n3. **Positions for the Letter Block:**  \n   - There are 5 possible positions to place this block among the digits.\n     \n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ positions}\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Choose the Digits:**  \n   -  \n     \n     \\[\n     10^4 = 10,000\n     \\]\n     ways to select the digits.\n   \n5. **Choose the Letters for \\(w\\):**  \n   -  \n     \n     \\[\n     26^2 = 676\n     \\]\n     ways to select the two letters.\n   \n6. **Combine All Factors:**\n   \n\\[\n\\text{Total Combinations} = 5 \\times 10,000 \\times 676 = 33,800,000\n\\]\n\n**Hmm, Let Me Double-Check My Reasoning Here...**\n\nDoes this make sense? By considering the letter block as a single unit and calculating its placement among the digits, I\u2019m ensuring that the letters are always together. This approach aligns better with the problem\u2019s constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Validating the New Approach: Trying a Different Method**\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Treating the Letters as a Block and Permuting the Rest**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s see if another method leads to the same result to confirm correctness.\n\n1. **Treat Letters as a Single Block:**  \n   - Total units to arrange: 5 (4 digits + 1 block).\n   \n2. **Permute the Units:**  \n   -  \n     \n     \\[\n     5!\n     \\]\n     ways to arrange these units.\n     \n     \\[\n     5! = 120\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Internal Arrangement of Letters:**  \n   - The two letters can be arranged within their block in  \n     \n     \\[\n     2!\n     \\]\n     ways.\n     \n     \\[\n     2! = 2\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Total Arrangements Accounting for Blocks:**\n   \n\\[\n5! \\times 2! = 120 \\times 2 = 240\n\\]\n\n5. **Choose Digits and Letters:**  \n   -  \n     \n     \\[\n     10^4 = 10,000\n     \\]\n     ways to choose digits.  \n   -  \n     \n     \\[\n     26^2 = 676\n     \\]\n     ways to choose letters.\n   \n6. **Combine All Factors:**\n   \n\\[\n10,000 \\times 676 \\times 240 = 1,622,400,000\n\\]\n\n**Oh! This Reminds Me of...**\n\nWait, this still leads to an overcount. It seems that by accounting for the internal arrangement of the letters separately, I\u2019m duplicating the constraints already handled by treating the letters as a block. This suggests that my initial correction was still off.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Adjustment: Simplifying the Approach**\n\n**Correct Strategy: Treating the Letter Block Appropriately**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nInstead of overcomplicating by considering internal arrangements separately, I should focus on placing the letter block among the digits and calculating the combinations accordingly.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Total Positions Available:**  \n   - 6 positions in total.\n   \n2. **Choose Position for the Letter Block:**  \n   - The letter block can occupy any one of the pairs of positions: (1-2), (2-3), (3-4), (4-5), (5-6).  \n   - Total: 5 positions.\n     \n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ choices}\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Choose the Digits:**  \n   -  \n     \n     \\[\n     10^4 = 10,000\n     \\]\n     ways to select digits.\n   \n4. **Choose the Letters:**  \n   -  \n     \n     \\[\n     26^2 = 676\n     \\]\n     ways to select the two letters forming the block.\n   \n5. **Combine All Factors Correctly:**\n   \n\\[\n5 \\times 10,000 \\times 676 = 33,800,000\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 10^4 \\times 26^2 = 5 \\times 10,000 \\times 676 = 33,800,000\n\\]\n\n**That Number Seems Much More Reasonable Compared to...**\n\nYes, this makes sense. By correctly accounting for the placement of the letter block and the choices of digits and letters, the total number of distinct license plates is significantly reduced from my initial overcount.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Ensuring the Solution Aligns with the Problem**\n\n**Recap of the Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Treat the Two Letters as a Block:**  \n   - This simplifies the arrangement by ensuring the letters are always together.\n   \n2. **Total Positions Available:**  \n   - 5 possible positions for this letter block among the 6 total positions.\n   \n3. **Calculate Total Combinations:**  \n   - Multiply the number of ways to position the letter block by the combinations of digits and letters.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Combinations} = 5 \\times 10,000 \\times 676 = 33,800,000\n   \\]\n   \n**Potential Check:**\n\nTo verify, consider a simplified scenario with fewer digits and letters. For example, if there were only 2 digits and 1 letter block, the same approach would yield accurate results, confirming the method\u2019s validity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy re-examining my initial strategy and recognizing the overcounting error, I adjusted my approach to correctly account for the constraint that the letters must be adjacent. This led to a more accurate calculation of the total distinct license plates.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>33,800,000 distinct license plates are possible.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough reflecting on my initial approach and identifying where I overcounted, I refined my strategy to accurately account for the constraint that the two letters must be adjacent. By treating the letters as a single block and calculating the total permutations accordingly, I arrived at the correct number of distinct license plates. This iterative process of checking and adjusting ensured the solution aligned with the problem's requirements.",
  "ground_truth": "Since the two letters have to be next to each other, think of them as forming a two-letter word $w$. So each license plate consists of 4 digits and $w$. For each digit there are 10 choices. There are $26\\cdot 26$ choices for the letters of $w$, and  there are 5 choices for the position of $w$. So the total number of distinct license plates is $5\\cdot10^4\\cdot26^2 = \\boxed{33,\\!800,\\!000}$."
