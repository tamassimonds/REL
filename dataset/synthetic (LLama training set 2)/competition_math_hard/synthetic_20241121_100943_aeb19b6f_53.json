  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, emulating a natural thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect along the way, check for correctness, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like tackling it in real life.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have a point \\((3\\sqrt{5}, d+3)\\) that's \\(3d\\) units away from the origin \\((0, 0)\\). We need to find the smallest possible value of \\(d\\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This feels like a distance problem involving the Pythagorean theorem since we're dealing with coordinates and distances.\n- **Possible Strategies:** \n  1. Use the distance formula.\n  2. Set up an equation based on the relationship between the coordinates and the distance.\n  3. Maybe consider squaring both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure yet. Let's explore and see which strategy fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Using the Distance Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n  \\]\n- Applying this to our problem with the origin:\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{(3\\sqrt{5} - 0)^2 + ((d+3) - 0)^2)} = 3d\n  \\]\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(3\\sqrt{5})^2 + (d+3)^2} = 3d\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a minute:** Dealing with square roots can be messy. Maybe it's better to square both sides to simplify.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Squaring Both Sides**\n\n\\[\n(3\\sqrt{5})^2 + (d+3)^2 = (3d)^2\n\\]\n\n**Calculating:**\n\n\\[\n45 + (d+3)^2 = 9d^2\n\\]\n\n**Expanding \\( (d+3)^2 \\):**\n\n\\[\n45 + d^2 + 6d + 9 = 9d^2\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n54 + d^2 + 6d = 9d^2\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n0 = 9d^2 - d^2 - 6d - 54\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0 = 8d^2 - 6d - 54\n\\]\n\n**Wait, That Doesn't Look Right...**\n\n- **Checking Calculation:** Hold on, let me double-check the arithmetic here. Did I expand correctly?\n\n\\[\n45 + 9 = 54 \\quad \\text{(Okay, that's correct)}\n\\]\n\n- **Re-examining Equation:** So, it actually should be:\n\n\\[\n0 = 8d^2 - 6d - 54\n\\]\n\n**Realizing a Mistake:**\n\n- **Hmm, That Can't Be Right:** The coefficients seem off. Let's go back and check the expansion.\n\n**Correcting the Expansion:**\n\n\\[\n45 + d^2 + 6d + 9 = 9d^2\n\\]\n\\[\n54 + d^2 + 6d = 9d^2\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = 8d^2 - 6d - 54\n\\]\n\n**Wait, That Can't Be Right...**\n\n- **Coefficient Seems Wrong:** The equation looks incorrect. Let me retrace my steps.\n\n**Re-expanding \\( (d+3)^2 \\):**\n\n\\[\n(d+3)^2 = d^2 + 6d + 9\n\\]\n\\[\n45 + d^2 + 6d + 9 = 9d^2\n\\]\n\\[\n54 + d^2 + 6d = 9d^2\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = 8d^2 - 6d - 54\n\\]\n\n**Hmm, Still Incorrect...**\n\n- **Possible Typo:** Wait, I see where I went wrong. I need to bring all terms to one side correctly.\n\n**Rearranging Correctly:**\n\n\\[\n8d^2 - 6d - 54 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Actually, Let's Make It Simpler:**\n\n- **Dividing All Terms by 2:** \n  \\[\n  4d^2 - 3d - 27 = 0\n  \\]\n\n**Oh! That's Better**\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Alternative Strategy 2: Factoring the Quadratic Equation**\n\n- **Reflection:** Maybe I can factor this quadratic equation to find \\(d\\).\n- **But Wait:** Factoring might be tricky here. Perhaps using the quadratic formula is more straightforward.\n\n**Alternative Strategy 3: Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Let's use the quadratic formula to solve for \\(d\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with the Quadratic Formula**\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(a = 4\\)\n- \\(b = -3\\)\n- \\(c = -27\\)\n\n**Calculating Step by Step:**\n\n1. **Calculating \\(b^2 - 4ac\\):**\n   \\[\n   (-3)^2 - 4 \\times 4 \\times (-27) = 9 + 432 = 441\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Taking the Square Root of 441:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{441} = 21\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Plugging into the Formula:**\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{3 \\pm 21}{8}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Finding the Two Possible Values of \\(d\\):**\n   - \\(d = \\frac{3 + 21}{8} = \\frac{24}{8} = 3\\)\n   - \\(d = \\frac{3 - 21}{8} = \\frac{-18}{8} = -\\frac{9}{4}\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, Negative \\(d\\) Doesn\u2019t Make Sense:** Since \\(d\\) represents a distance, it must be non-negative.\n- **Conclusion:** So, the smallest possible value of \\(d\\) is \\(3\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Does \\(d = 3\\) Satisfy the Original Equation?**\n- **Let's Plug Back into the Distance Formula to Verify:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(3\\sqrt{5})^2 + (3+3)^2} = 3 \\times 3\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{45 + 36} = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{81} = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n9 = 9 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **The Solution Is Correct:** \\(d = 3\\) satisfies the distance equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{d = 3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Recap and Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:** Started with the distance formula and squared both sides to simplify.\n- **Encountered Issues:** Made a small arithmetic error initially but caught it upon reflection.\n- **Adjusted Approach:** Corrected the mistake and proceeded with the quadratic formula.\n- **Validated Solution:** Checked the solution by plugging back into the original equation.\n- **Final Conclusion:** The smallest possible value of \\(d\\) is \\(3\\).\n\nBy walking through different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying the solution, we've confidently arrived at the correct answer.",
  "ground_truth": "By the distance formula, the distance between the origin and $(3\\sqrt{5},d+3)$ is $\\sqrt{(3\\sqrt{5})^2+(d+3)^2}$. Setting this equal to $3d$, we have  \\begin{align*}\n9d^2&=(3\\sqrt{5})^2+(d+3)^2\\\\\n9d^2&=45+d^2+6d+9\\\\\n8d^2-6d-54&=0\\\\\n4d^2-3d-27&=0\\\\\n(4d+9)(d-3)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $d$ are $-\\frac{9}{4}$ and $3$. We find that $-\\frac{9}{4}$ is an extraneous answer (since distance cannot be negative), so our answer is $d=\\boxed{3}$."
