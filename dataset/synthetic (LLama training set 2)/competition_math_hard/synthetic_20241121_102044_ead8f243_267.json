What is the probability that **at least two dice show the same number**?\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We have **six 6-sided dice**, each numbered from 1 to 6. The goal is to find the probability that **at least two dice show the same number**.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis sounds like a probability problem involving dice outcomes and avoiding duplicates. It reminds me of the **Birthday Paradox**, where it's often easier to calculate the probability of no duplicates and then subtract from one. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the best approach here. Maybe we should explore a few strategies to see which one fits best.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Probability of No Duplicates:** Find the probability that all six dice show different numbers and then subtract from 1.\n   \n2. **Use the Complement Rule:** Similar to the first, but explicitly calculating the complement of having at least one duplicate.\n   \n3. **Direct Calculation:** Attempt to calculate the probability of at least two dice showing the same number directly, perhaps by considering different cases (e.g., exactly two dice the same, exactly three, etc.).\n   \n4. **Simulation:** Although not an exact method for this type of problem, simulating many dice rolls could give an approximate idea.\n\n**Chosen Approach:**  \nGiven these options, I think starting with the **complement approach** makes sense because calculating the probability of no duplicates might be more straightforward. But if that doesn't work out, we can try the direct calculation method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Complement Approach**\n\nLet's begin by calculating the probability that **all six dice show different numbers** (i.e., no duplicates). If we can find this probability, we can subtract it from 1 to get the probability of having at least one duplicate.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf all six dice show different numbers, then we're essentially choosing 6 unique numbers out of the 6 available sides. But wait, there are only 6 sides, so once we've used all six numbers, there are no more unique numbers left. This feels like a permutation problem.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **First Die:** 6 possible outcomes.\n  \n- **Second Die:** To avoid duplicates, 5 remaining outcomes.\n  \n- **Third Die:** 4 outcomes remain, and so on.\n\nSo, the number of ways to roll six dice with all different numbers is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\n\\]\n\n**Total Possible Outcomes:**  \nEach die has 6 sides, so the total number of possible outcomes for six dice is:\n\n\\[\n6^6 = 46,656\n\\]\n\n**Probability of No Duplicates:**  \n\\[\nP(\\text{No duplicates}) = \\frac{720}{46,656} = \\frac{5}{324} \\approx 0.0154\n\\]\n\n**Probability of At Least Two Dice Showing the Same Number:**  \n\\[\nP(\\text{At least one duplicate}) = 1 - \\frac{5}{324} = \\frac{319}{324} \\approx 0.9846\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute. This probability seems extremely high\u2014over 98%! That feels intuitively correct because with six dice and only six possible outcomes, it's highly likely that at least two dice will show the same number. But let me double-check my calculations to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Total possible outcomes: \\(6^6 = 46,656\\). Yeah, that\u2019s correct.\n  \n- Number of favorable outcomes (all different): \\(6! = 720\\). That checks out.\n  \n- Calculating the probability: \\(\\frac{720}{46,656} = \\frac{5}{324}\\). Simplifying the fraction also seems correct.\n\nOkay, everything seems to be in order. But just to be sure, let's explore another method to see if we arrive at the same conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting Direct Calculation**\n\nNow, let's attempt to calculate the probability directly by considering different cases where at least two dice show the same number. This involves looking at all possible combinations where duplicates occur.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis method is more complex because we need to account for multiple scenarios:\n\n- Exactly two dice show the same number.\n  \n- Exactly three dice show the same number, and so on up to all six dice showing the same number.\n\nGiven the complexity, this **approach might be prone to errors and time-consuming**. But let's give it a try to see if we can validate our previous result.\n\n#### **Case 1: Exactly Two Dice Show the Same Number**\n\nLet's start with the simplest case where exactly two dice show the same number. However, this approach requires considering which two dice are the same and which are different, leading to multiple sub-cases.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Choose 2 out of 6 dice** to have the same number: \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\) ways.\n  \n- **Choose a number** for these two dice: 6 ways.\n  \n- For the **remaining 4 dice**, each must show a different number from the remaining 5 numbers: \n  \\[\n  5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 120\\text{ ways}\n  \\]\n\nSo, the total number of ways for exactly two dice to show the same number is:\n\n\\[\n15 \\times 6 \\times 120 = 10,800\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, this number seems quite large. Let me double-check the reasoning here. Oh, I see\u2014I\u2019ve only considered the case where exactly two dice are the same, but there are additional cases where more than two dice show the same number. This approach is getting messy and might lead to overcounting if not handled carefully.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGiven that this method is becoming **complicated and time-consuming**, it's better to stick with the **complement approach**, which was more straightforward and less prone to errors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verification Through Intuition**\n\nTo ensure that our initial complement approach is correct, let's think about the problem differently. Suppose we only had two dice\u2014what would the probability be then? Expanding this intuition to six dice might help solidify our understanding.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWith two dice, the probability that they show different numbers is straightforward:\n\n- **First Die:** 6 possible outcomes.\n  \n- **Second Die:** 5 outcomes remaining to be different from the first.\n\nSo, the probability of no duplicates with two dice is \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\), and therefore, the probability of **at least one duplicate** is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n**Extending to Six Dice:**  \nSimilarly, as we increase the number of dice, the likelihood of having at least one duplicate increases. This aligns with our earlier result, where with six dice, the probability of at least one duplicate is very high (\\(\\frac{319}{324}\\)).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis intuition check supports our initial calculation. As the number of dice increases while the number of possible outcomes remains fixed, the probability of duplicates occurring naturally increases.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's perform a quick sanity check by considering extreme cases:\n\n1. **Minimum Number of Dice (2):**  \n   As mentioned earlier, with two dice, the probability of at least one duplicate is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\), which makes sense because only one out of the six possible outcomes results in no duplicates.\n   \n2. **Maximum Number of Dice (6):**  \n   With six dice and only six possible outcomes, having all unique numbers is only possible in one specific arrangement (all six numbers appearing once). Hence, the probability of having at least one duplicate is very high.\n\nGiven these checks, our initial calculation using the complement approach seems accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{319}{324} \\approx 0.9846}\\]\n\n<ANSWER> \\(\\frac{319}{324} \\approx 0.9846\\) solution</ANSWER>\n\nBy exploring different strategies and validating our approach through intuition and sanity checks, we've confidently concluded that the probability of at least two dice showing the same number is approximately **0.9846**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Started with the Complement Approach:** Calculated the probability of all dice showing different numbers and subtracted from 1.\n  \n- **Attempted Direct Calculation:** Found it to be complex and error-prone, reinforcing the complement approach's effectiveness.\n  \n- **Verified with Intuition:** Considered smaller cases and extreme scenarios to validate the initial method.\n  \n- **Performed Final Checks:** Ensured consistency across different perspectives to confirm the accuracy of the solution.\n\n**Outcome:**  \nThe probability that at least two of the six dice show the same number is \\(\\frac{319}{324} \\approx 0.9846\\).\n\n---  \n\nDuring the whole thing, it recognizes different strategies, double-checks calculations, and uses intuition to confirm the correctness of the solution. The student learns to trust their initial approach after attempting an alternative method and performing sanity checks, ultimately arriving at the correct probability.",
  "ground_truth": "The only way in which there won't be two dice of the same number is if for each number between 1 and 6 there is exactly one die displaying that number. If we line the dice up, there are a total of $6!$ ways in which we could order 6 dice all displaying different numbers and a total of $6^6$ possible outcomes since each of the 6 dice can have 6 outcomes and all of the rolls are determined independently. That means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\\dfrac{6!}{6^6}=\\dfrac{5}{324}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\\dfrac{5}{324}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{319}{324}}$."
