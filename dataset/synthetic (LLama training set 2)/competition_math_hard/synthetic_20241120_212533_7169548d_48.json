I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check for correctness, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, we're dealing with a running track formed by two concentric circles. Concentric means they share the same center, which is helpful. The problem states that the circumferences of the two circles differ by \\(10\\pi\\) feet. The goal is to find the width of the track, which I assume is the distance between the two circles' radii.\n\nHmm... This reminds me of problems involving circles and their circumferences. I know that the circumference \\(C\\) of a circle is given by \\(C = 2\\pi r\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius. Maybe I can use this formula to find the radii and thus the width of the track.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use Circumference Formula:** \n   - Compute the circumferences of both circles using \\(C = 2\\pi r\\).\n   - Set up an equation based on the difference in circumferences.\n\n2. **Express Width in Terms of Radii:**\n   - The width of the track is the difference between the outer and inner radii.\n   - Relate this difference to the given \\(10\\pi\\).\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:**\n   - Solve the equations to find the width directly.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first strategy and see where it leads.\n\n**Step 1: Set Up Equations Using Circumference Formula**\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- \\(r_{\\text{inner}}\\) as the radius of the inner circle.\n- \\(r_{\\text{outer}}\\) as the radius of the outer circle.\n\nThe circumferences are:\n- Inner Circle: \\(C_{\\text{inner}} = 2\\pi r_{\\text{inner}}\\)\n- Outer Circle: \\(C_{\\text{outer}} = 2\\pi r_{\\text{outer}}\\)\n\nAccording to the problem, the difference in circumferences is \\(10\\pi\\):\n\\[\nC_{\\text{outer}} - C_{\\text{inner}} = 10\\pi\n\\]\nSubstituting the expressions for circumferences:\n\\[\n2\\pi r_{\\text{outer}} - 2\\pi r_{\\text{inner}} = 10\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Equation**\n\nHmm, I notice that both sides of the equation have \\(\\pi\\). Let's divide both sides by \\(2\\pi\\) to simplify:\n\\[\nr_{\\text{outer}} - r_{\\text{inner}} = \\frac{10\\pi}{2\\pi} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. The difference between the outer and inner radii is 5 feet. So, the width of the track is 5 feet.\n\nDoes this make sense? Let me think...\n\n- The \\(2\\pi\\) factors cancel out neatly.\n- The result is a simple arithmetic value, which aligns with the problem's simplicity.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify by plugging back:\n- If \\(r_{\\text{outer}} - r_{\\text{inner}} = 5\\),\n- Then the circumferences\u2019 difference is:\n  \\[\n  2\\pi (r_{\\text{outer}}) - 2\\pi (r_{\\text{inner}}) = 2\\pi \\times 5 = 10\\pi\n  \\]\n  \nThat matches the given condition perfectly!\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter brainstorming and working through the strategy, the width of the track is **5 feet**. The approach using the circumference formula was straightforward and effective.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nI'm glad I started by setting up the basic equations. Initially, I considered multiple strategies, but the first one led directly to the solution. Checking the work was crucial; it confirmed that the approach was correct. Overall, thinking through each step, reflecting, and verifying ensured that the solution was accurate.",

  "ground_truth": "Call the radius of the outer circle $r_1$ and that of the inner circle $r_2$. The width of the track is $r_1-r_2$. The circumference of a circle is $2\\pi$ times the radius, so the difference in circumferences is $2\\pi r_1-2\\pi r_2=10\\pi$ feet. If we divide each side by $2\\pi$, we get $r_1-r_2=\\boxed{5}$ feet."
