  "problem": "Let $f(x) = (x+2)^2-5$. If the domain of $f$ is all real numbers, then $f$ does not have an inverse function, but if we restrict the domain of $f$ to an interval $[c,\\infty)$, then $f$ may have an inverse function. What is the smallest value of $c$ we can use here, so that $f$ does have an inverse function?",
  "solution": "### **Complete Solution**\n\nAlright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process as if I'm solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work as I go.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question is about finding the smallest value of \\( c \\) so that the function \\( f(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5 \\) has an inverse when its domain is restricted to \\([c, \\infty)\\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of dealing with functions and their inverses, specifically making functions one-to-one by restricting their domains. I think I need to make \\( f(x) \\) monotonic (either always increasing or always decreasing) over the specified domain.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** But wait, I'm not entirely sure how to determine the smallest \\( c \\). Should I look at the vertex of the parabola? Or maybe analyze the function's derivatives?\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Let me explore checking the monotonicity of \\( f(x) \\) and see if restricting the domain from the vertex point works.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n#### **1. Understanding the Function\u2019s Behavior**\n\n- **Idea:** I should graph the function or at least visualize it to see where it changes direction. Knowing that \\( f(x) \\) is a quadratic, it likely has a vertex where the function switches from decreasing to increasing.\n\n- **Thought Process:** If I can find the vertex, maybe setting \\( c \\) at the vertex will make the function one-to-one from that point onward.\n\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Quadratics are symmetric, so the vertex is the point where the function changes direction. Restricting the domain from the vertex should make the function either entirely increasing or decreasing.\n\n#### **2. Finding the Vertex**\n\n- **Calculation:** The function is \\( f(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5 \\). This is in the form \\( (x-h)^2 + k \\), where \\( h = -2 \\) and \\( k = -5 \\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Vertex: } (h, k) = (-2, -5)\n  \\]\n\n- **Result:** So, the vertex is at \\( x = -2 \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** Okay, if the vertex is at \\( x = -2 \\), then restricting the domain to \\([c, \\infty)\\) with \\( c = -2 \\) should make the function one-to-one.\n\n#### **3. Checking Monotonicity from the Vertex**\n\n- **Idea:** Let\u2019s confirm that the function is increasing from \\( x = -2 \\) onward.\n\n- **Approach:** I can take the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) to see where it's positive.\n\n- **Calculation:** \n\n  \\[\n  f(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5 \n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  f'(x) = 2(x+2)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Analysis:** The derivative \\( f'(x) = 2(x+2) \\) is zero at \\( x = -2 \\) and positive for \\( x > -2 \\).\n\n- **Check:** This confirms that \\( f(x) \\) is increasing for \\( x \\geq -2 \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** Great, so setting \\( c = -2 \\) makes the function one-to-one on \\([c, \\infty)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Testing the Strategy**\n\n- **Thought:** Before finalizing, let me verify if setting \\( c = -2 \\) truly allows for an inverse.\n\n- **Check:** By restricting the domain to \\([-2, \\infty)\\), the function is strictly increasing, meaning each output corresponds to exactly one input.\n\n- **Conclusion:** This satisfies the condition for having an inverse function.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategies**\n\n- **Idea:** What if I considered restricting the domain from a point greater than the vertex, say \\( c > -2 \\)?\n\n- **Reflection:** But the question asks for the **smallest** value of \\( c \\). So, starting at the vertex is essential to ensure minimal restriction while maintaining one-to-one behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Thought:** Is there any possibility that \\( c \\) could be smaller than \\(-2\\)?\n\n- **Analysis:** If \\( c < -2 \\), the function would include portions where it's decreasing, violating the one-to-one requirement.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Therefore, \\( c = -2 \\) is indeed the smallest value that satisfies the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>\nThe smallest value of \\( c \\) is \\(\\boxed{-2}\\).\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Exploration:** Started by identifying the need to make \\( f(x) \\) one-to-one through domain restriction.\n- **Strategy:** Found the vertex of the quadratic to determine where the function becomes monotonic.\n- **Verification:** Used the derivative to confirm monotonicity from \\( x = -2 \\) onwards.\n- **Reflection:** Considered and dismissed alternative strategies that would not minimize \\( c \\).\n- **Final Check:** Ensured that \\( c = -2 \\) is the smallest value preserving the function\u2019s invertibility.\n\n---\n\nBy walking through these steps, reflecting, and verifying at each stage, I arrived confidently at the solution.",
  "ground_truth": "For $f$ to have an inverse function, it must not take any repeated value -- that is, we must not have $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ for distinct $x_1$ and $x_2$ in its domain.\n\nThe graph of $y=(x+2)^2-5$ is a parabola with vertex at $(-2,-5)$:\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.2 cm);\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(-6,3,Ticks(f, 1.0, Size=1));\nyaxis(-6,5,Ticks(f, 1.0, Size=1));\n\nreal g(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn (x+2)^2-5;\n}\n\ndraw(graph(g,-5.2,1.2));\ndot((-2,-5));\nlabel(\"Vertex: $(-2,-5)$\", (-2,-5), SW);\n[/asy] The axis of symmetry is the line $x=-2$, so for every $x$ less than $-2$, there is a corresponding $x$ greater than $-2$ where $f$ takes the same value. If we restrict the domain of $f$ to $[-2,\\infty)$, then $f$ has no repeated values, as $f$ is increasing throughout its domain. But if we restrict the domain to $[c,\\infty)$ where $c<-2$, then $f$ has repeated values. So, the smallest $c$ which will work is $c=\\boxed{-2}$."
