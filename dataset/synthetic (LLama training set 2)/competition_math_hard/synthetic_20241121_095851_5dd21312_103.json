I'll maintain the original thought process, including brainstorming, reflecting, and checking each step, to ensure it flows naturally like a human solving the problem. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Question\n\nAlright, we\u2019re given a piecewise function \\( f(x) \\) defined based on multiples of 3 and 7:\n\n- If \\( x \\) is a multiple of 3 but not 7: \\( f(x) = \\frac{x}{3} \\)\n- If \\( x \\) is a multiple of 7 but not 3: \\( f(x) = 3x \\)\n- If \\( x \\) is a multiple of both 3 and 7: \\( f(x) = \\frac{x}{21} \\)\n- Otherwise: \\( f(x) = x + 3 \\)\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest \\( a > 1 \\) such that \\( f(2) = f^a(2) \\), where \\( f^a(x) \\) means applying \\( f \\) recursively \\( a \\) times.\n\n**First Reaction:**  \nHmm, this looks like a problem involving fixed points or cycles in functions. Maybe \\( f(2) \\) settles into a value that repeats after a few applications. I'm not entirely sure how to approach it right away, so let's explore some strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Compute \\( f(2) \\) and then \\( f^a(2) \\) for increasing \\( a \\):**  \n   Start by finding \\( f(2) \\) and apply \\( f \\) repeatedly to see when the values stabilize.\n\n2. **Analyze the behavior of \\( f(x) \\) for inputs like 2:**  \n   Since 2 is neither a multiple of 3 nor 7, maybe its path through the function is straightforward.\n\n3. **Look for patterns or cycles:**  \n   Check if applying \\( f \\) repeatedly leads to a cycle or a fixed point.\n\n**Leaning Towards:**  \nI think starting with the first strategy\u2014computing \\( f(2) \\) and then applying \\( f \\) repeatedly\u2014makes sense. It\u2019s a direct approach and should reveal any patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( f(2) \\)\n\nSince 2 is **not a multiple of 3 or 7**, according to the function:\n\n\\[\nf(2) = 2 + 3 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so \\( f(2) = 5 \\). Now, I need to see if applying \\( f \\) again and again eventually brings us back to 5 or if a different pattern emerges.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\( f^2(2) = f(f(2)) = f(5) \\)\n\nLet's find \\( f(5) \\).  \n5 is **not a multiple of 3 or 7**, so:\n\n\\[\nf(5) = 5 + 3 = 8\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, so \\( f^2(2) = 8 \\). This is different from \\( f(2) = 5 \\). It seems like we're moving to a new value. Let's keep going to see what happens next.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute \\( f^3(2) = f(f^2(2)) = f(8) \\)\n\nNext, let's find \\( f(8) \\).  \n8 is **not a multiple of 3 or 7**, so:\n\n\\[\nf(8) = 8 + 3 = 11\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, \\( f^3(2) = 11 \\). We keep getting different values. Maybe there's a pattern forming, but it's not immediately clear. Let's continue.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute \\( f^4(2) = f(f^3(2)) = f(11) \\)\n\nNow, let's find \\( f(11) \\).  \n11 is **not a multiple of 3 or 7**, so:\n\n\\[\nf(11) = 11 + 3 = 14\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nSo, \\( f^4(2) = 14 \\). Still no repetition with \\( f(2) = 5 \\). It seems we're moving up by adding 3 each time. Is this going to continue indefinitely? Let's think about it.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compute \\( f^5(2) = f(f^4(2)) = f(14) \\)\n\nLet's see what happens with \\( f(14) \\).  \n14 is a **multiple of 7 but not 3**, so according to the function:\n\n\\[\nf(14) = 3 \\times 14 = 42\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOh, interesting! Now we've hit a multiple of 7, which changes the rule being applied. This might alter the pattern we've been seeing. Let's proceed and see what happens next.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Compute \\( f^6(2) = f(f^5(2)) = f(42) \\)\n\nNow, let's find \\( f(42) \\).  \n42 is a **multiple of both 3 and 7**, so:\n\n\\[\nf(42) = \\frac{42}{21} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nWait a minute! We've cycled back to 2, our original input. This suggests that applying \\( f \\) again will repeat the cycle. Let's verify by taking one more step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Compute \\( f^7(2) = f(f^6(2)) = f(2) \\)\n\nSince \\( f^6(2) = 2 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nf^7(2) = f(2) = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, \\( f^7(2) = 5 \\), which matches our original \\( f(2) \\). It looks like we've entered a cycle where every six applications return us to the starting point.\n\n---\n\n### Identifying the Cycle\n\nFrom the computations:\n\n- \\( f(2) = 5 \\)\n- \\( f^2(2) = 8 \\)\n- \\( f^3(2) = 11 \\)\n- \\( f^4(2) = 14 \\)\n- \\( f^5(2) = 42 \\)\n- \\( f^6(2) = 2 \\)\n- \\( f^7(2) = 5 \\) (back to \\( f(2) \\))\n\n**Pattern Observed:**  \nEvery six steps, we return to the original input value \\( x = 2 \\), and \\( f(2) = 5 \\) repeats. This indicates a cycle of length 6.\n\n---\n\n### Final Check: Does \\( f^a(2) = f(2) \\) for \\( a = 7 \\)?\n\nGiven that \\( f^7(2) = 5 = f(2) \\), and since \\( a > 1 \\), the smallest such \\( a \\) is 7.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nInitially, I thought it might be a smaller \\( a \\), but the computations clearly show that \\( a = 7 \\) is the first instance where \\( f^a(2) = f(2) \\). It's essential to verify each step to ensure no patterns were missed.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative Strategy: Analyzing the Function's Behavior\n\n**Wait a moment...**  \nActually, let's backtrack and consider another strategy to verify our findings. Maybe there's a more efficient way to see the pattern without computing every step.\n\n**New Strategy:**  \nInstead of computing each step, let's analyze how the function behaves based on the multiples of 3 and 7.\n\n1. **Starting at \\( x = 2 \\):**  \n   - Not a multiple of 3 or 7: \\( f(2) = 5 \\)\n\n2. **Next, \\( x = 5 \\):**  \n   - Not a multiple of 3 or 7: \\( f(5) = 8 \\)\n\n3. **Continue this way until hitting a multiple of 7:**  \n   - \\( f(8) = 11 \\)\n   - \\( f(11) = 14 \\)\n   - \\( f(14) = 42 \\) (multiple of 7)\n\n4. **At \\( x = 42 \\):**  \n   - Multiple of both 3 and 7: \\( f(42) = 2 \\)\n\n5. **Returning to \\( x = 2 \\):**  \n   - Back to the start, creating a cycle.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis confirms our earlier findings that a cycle of length 6 exists, and \\( a = 7 \\) satisfies \\( f^a(2) = f(2) \\).\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThrough step-by-step computation and reflection, we've determined that the smallest value of \\( a > 1 \\) satisfying \\( f(2) = f^a(2) \\) is **7**. This was confirmed by identifying a cycle in the function's application, where every six steps return to the original input value.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying our computations, we've confidently arrived at the solution. It's crucial to remain flexible in problem-solving, willing to backtrack, and consider alternative approaches to ensure accuracy.\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration provides a clear understanding of how to tackle such problems, emphasizing the importance of reflecting and checking your work throughout the process.",
  "ground_truth": "Since 2 is not a multiple of 3 or 7, $f(2)=2+3=5$ and we want to find an $a$ where $f^a(2)=5$. So, we keep track of how many times we evaluate $f$ of our previous result until we get 5.  \\begin{align*}\nf(2)&=5\\\\\nf(f(2))&=f(5)=5+3=8 \\qquad 5 \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\\\\\nf(f(f(2)))&=f(8)=8+3=11 \\qquad 8 \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\\\\\nf^4(2)&=11+3=14 \\qquad 11 \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\\\\\nf^5(2)&=3\\cdot14=42 \\qquad 14 \\text{ is a multiple of 7.}\\\\\nf^6(2)&=\\frac{42}{21}=2 \\qquad 42 \\text{ is a multiple of 3 and 7.}\\\\\nf^7(2)&=2+3=5 \\qquad 2 \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\n\\end{align*}So the least $a>1$ for which $f^a(2)=f(2)$ is $a=\\boxed{7}$."
