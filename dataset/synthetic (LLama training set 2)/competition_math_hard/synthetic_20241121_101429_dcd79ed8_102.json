  "solution": "---\n\nAlright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step. I'll walk you through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness, and reflecting along the way to ensure we arrive at the right solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the problem:\n\n- **Immediate Reaction:** It mentions a right triangle with two sides measuring 5 and 12 units. Right away, I think of the Pythagorean theorem since it\u2019s fundamental to right triangles: \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.\n\n- **But Wait:** The problem doesn\u2019t specify which of the sides are the hypotenuse or the legs. This ambiguity means I need to consider different scenarios to find the least possible length of the third side.\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:** \n  - **Scenario 1:** Both 5 and 12 are the legs.\n  - **Scenario 2:** One of the given sides is the hypotenuse.\n  \n  I\u2019ll start by exploring each scenario to ensure I cover all possibilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Assuming 5 and 12 are the Legs**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **First Strategy:** If both given sides are the legs, then the third side must be the hypotenuse.\n\n- **Applying Pythagorean Theorem:**\n  \\[\n  c = \\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 144} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** \n  - \\(5^2 = 25\\) and \\(12^2 = 144\\), so \\(25 + 144 = 169\\).\n  - The square root of 169 is indeed 13.\n  \n- **Outcome:** The hypotenuse is 13 units.\n\n- **But Remember:** The question asks for the **least possible** length of the third side. Is there a scenario where the third side could be shorter than 13?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Assuming 12 is the Hypotenuse**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Let's consider 12 as the hypotenuse and see if 5 can be one of the legs. This would make the third side another leg.\n\n- **Applying Pythagorean Theorem:**\n  \\[\n  b = \\sqrt{c^2 - a^2} = \\sqrt{12^2 - 5^2} = \\sqrt{144 - 25} = \\sqrt{119} \\approx 10.91\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:**\n  - \\(12^2 = 144\\) and \\(5^2 = 25\\), so \\(144 - 25 = 119\\).\n  - The square root of 119 is approximately 10.91.\n\n- **Outcome:** The third side is about 10.91 units.\n\n- **Comparison:** This is shorter than the previous scenario where the hypotenuse was 13 units. This suggests that assigning the larger given side as the hypotenuse results in a shorter third side.\n\n- **Aha Moment:** It seems that by making 12 the hypotenuse, the remaining side is minimized.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Assuming 5 is the Hypotenuse**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Final Strategy:** Suppose 5 is the hypotenuse. Let\u2019s see if this scenario is possible.\n\n- **Applying Pythagorean Theorem:**\n  \\[\n  a = \\sqrt{c^2 - b^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 - 12^2} = \\sqrt{25 - 144} = \\sqrt{-119}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:**\n  - \\(5^2 = 25\\) and \\(12^2 = 144\\), so \\(25 - 144 = -119\\).\n  - Taking the square root of a negative number doesn\u2019t make sense in real numbers.\n\n- **Outcome:** This scenario is **impossible** because the hypotenuse cannot be shorter than the other sides.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Assuming 5 as the hypotenuse doesn't work, so we can disregard this case.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Reviewing All Scenarios:**\n\n- **First Scenario:** Hypotenuse is 13 when both given sides are legs.\n- **Second Scenario:** Third side is approximately 10.91 (\\(\\sqrt{119}\\)) when 12 is the hypotenuse.\n- **Third Scenario:** Invalid, as 5 cannot be the hypotenuse.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\n- **Least Possible Length:** The shortest valid length for the third side is \\(\\sqrt{119}\\) units when 12 is the hypotenuse and 5 is one of the legs.\n\n- **Quick Verification:**\n  \\[\n  5^2 + (\\sqrt{119})^2 = 25 + 119 = 144 = 12^2\n  \\]\n  \n  This satisfies the Pythagorean theorem, confirming the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically exploring each possible assignment of the given sides and applying the Pythagorean theorem, we've determined that the least possible length of the third side is \\(\\sqrt{119}\\) units.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\sqrt{119}\\) units.\n\n---\n\nI hope this walkthrough helps you understand the thought process behind solving such problems, including exploring multiple strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the correctness of the solution.",
  "ground_truth": "The third side is either the hypotenuse of the right triangle or one of the legs.  It is shorter in the latter case, because the angle between the sides of length 5 and 12 is smaller.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the missing leg is $\\sqrt{12^2-5^2}=\\boxed{\\sqrt{119}}$ units.  (Note: $\\sqrt{119}$ does not simplify since $119 = 7\\cdot 17$)."
