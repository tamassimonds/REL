    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, expressing all the messy bits and explorations naturally as they come.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n\nThe problem asks us to find a real number \\( r \\) such that the polynomial \\( f(x) = 8x^3 - 4x^2 - 42x + 45 \\) is divisible by \\( (x-r)^2 \\). \n\nOkay, this sounds like:\n\n1. \\( (x-r) \\) is a double root, which means \\( r \\) is a root of the polynomial with multiplicity at least 2.\n2. For \\( (x-r)^2 \\) to divide the polynomial, both \\( r \\) and \\( r^2 \\) must somehow be involved in ensuring that \\( f(r) = 0 \\) and \\( f'(r) = 0 \\).\n\n### Brainstorming:\n\nI think this reminds me of problems where the polynomial should have a root that also makes its derivative vanish, ensuring a \"smooth\" touch. Let's see:\n\n1. **Step 1:** Since \\( (x-r)^2 \\) divides \\( f(x) \\), \\( f(r) = 0 \\) must hold.\n2. **Step 2:** Additionally, since the root is repeated, \\( f'(r) = 0 \\) must also be satisfied.\n\nSo, our approach is pivoting on solving \\( f(r) = 0 \\) and \\( f'(r) = 0 \\) while considering the form of the polynomial.\n\n### Let's Break It Down:\n\n#### Step 1: Find \\( f'(x) \\)\n\nFirst, differentiate \\( f(x) = 8x^3 - 4x^2 - 42x + 45 \\).\n\n\\[ f'(x) = 24x^2 - 8x - 42 \\]\n\n#### Step 2: Solve \\( f(r) = 0 \\)\n\nNow, set up the equation \\( f(r) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 8r^3 - 4r^2 - 42r + 45 = 0 \\]\n\nAlready, I'm seeing this could be messy to solve just algebraically without any numerical roots or simplifications made easy.\n\n#### Step 3: Solve \\( f'(r) = 0 \\)\n\nSet up the equation \\( f'(r) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 24r^2 - 8r - 42 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic formula, and I could solve for \\( r \\) using the quadratic formula: \n\n\\[ r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\( a = 24 \\), \\( b = -8 \\), and \\( c = -42 \\).\n\nOkay, re-calculate that because quick number checks show my intuition should catch that: \n\n\\[ r = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4 \\cdot 24 \\cdot (-42)}}{2 \\cdot 24} \\]\n\nHanging here with numbers: \n\n1. \\( (-8)^2 = 64 \\)\n2. The discriminant (ugh, that multiplication looks big):\n   \\[ 64 + 4 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 42 = 64 + 4032 = 4096 \\]\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{4096}}{48} \\]\n\nWhoa! Realization, that is a perfect square \\( \\sqrt{4096} = 64 \\).\n\nSo \\[ r = \\frac{8 \\pm 64}{48} \\] gives two possibilities:\n\n- \\( r = \\frac{72}{48} = \\frac{3}{2} \\)\n- \\( r = \\frac{-56}{48} = -\\frac{7}{6} \\)\n\n#### Step 4: Check Roots in \\( f(r) = 0 \\)\n\nSo we have potential roots. But just because \\( f'(r) = 0 \\) for these doesn't guarantee \\( f(r) = 0 \\) without a re-scrutiny.\n\n1. \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\)\n2. \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\)\n\nPlugging into original polynomial \\( f(x) \\):\n\n- Substitute \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\) into \\( f(x) \\):\n  \\[ 8\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3 - 4\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - 42\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) + 45 \\]\n  \\[ 8 \\cdot \\frac{27}{8} - 4 \\cdot \\frac{9}{4} - 63 + 45 \\]\n  \\[ 27 - 9 - 63 + 45 \\neq 0 \\] (Check says no)\n\n- Substitute \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\) (pause, maybe simpler, double-check):\n  \\[ 8\\left(-\\frac{7}{6}\\right)^3 - 4\\left(-\\frac{7}{6}\\right)^2 - 42\\left(-\\frac{7}{6}\\right) + 45 \\]\n\nHmm, I am suspicious... Will this vanish?\n\nBy sheer idea of balance let's focus numbers again:\n\nRepeat and repeat or symbolic:\n\n- Cubic and square in balance of sign-check (positive pass involvement), and approach numeric.\n\nFinally settling:\n\nIt's looking more straightforward the balancing:\n \n- Re-solving round: \\( f(r) = 0 \\) holds for \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nRe-correction: Solving accurately aligns intersection for \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\).\n\nUltimately, \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\) is ensured per step rechecks crossing previous steps I had doubted while rigorous policing.\n\nAll clicks with earlier confusion mitigated. The real number \\( r \\) we're looking for is \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\). \nSurprisingly, since calculations have not led here easily from derivative try before, looks keen enough for verified confirm.\n\nReflect with heavy numeric convo or removal as uncluttered pattern among trial sets.\n\nAhh, I see I made an error in my previous solution. Let's revisit this problem and explore a different strategy to find the correct answer. I'll thoroughly brainstorm and delve into a variety of methods to ensure accuracy this time.\n\n### Re-evaluating Strategy\n\nPreviously, I attempted to solve the problem by finding roots using the conditions \\( f(r) = 0 \\) and \\( f'(r) = 0 \\), but it seems something went awry in my calculations. Let's try a fresh method, focusing more on matching coefficients and exploring the relationships between the coefficients of the polynomial and its factorization.\n\n### Exploring a New Method: Coefficient Matching\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We are given the polynomial \\( f(x) = 8x^3 - 4x^2 - 42x + 45 \\) and need to find \\( r \\) such that \\( f(x) \\) is divisible by \\((x-r)^2\\). This implies \\((x-r)^2(x-s)\\) for some third root \\( s \\).\n\n2. **Factorization Form**:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = 8(x-r)^2(x-s)\n   \\]\n   Expanding this, we get:\n   \\[\n   = 8(x^3 - (2r+s)x^2 + (r^2 + 2rs)x - r^2s)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Matching Coefficients**: Compare with the original polynomial:\n   - \\( 8x^3 \\) term is correct.\n   - \\( -8(2r+s) = -4 \\)\n   - \\( 8(r^2 + 2rs) = -42 \\)\n   - \\( -8r^2s = 45 \\)\n\n4. **Solving the System**:\n   - First equation: \\( 2r + s = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n   - Second equation: \\( r^2 + 2rs = -\\frac{21}{4} \\)\n   - Third equation: \\( r^2s = -\\frac{45}{8} \\)\n\n5. **Substitution**:\n   - From the first equation, \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} - 2r \\).\n   - Substitute \\( s \\) into the second equation:\n     \\[\n     r^2 + 2r\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 2r\\right) = -\\frac{21}{4}\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we have:\n     \\[\n     12r^2 - 4r - 21 = 0\n     \\]\n     Factoring yields:\n     \\[\n     (2r - 3)(6r + 7) = 0\n     \\]\n     Thus, \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\) or \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\).\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - If \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\), then \\( s = -\\frac{5}{2} \\).\n   - If \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\), then \\( s = \\frac{17}{6} \\).\n\n7. **Check Condition \\( r^2s = -\\frac{45}{8} \\)**:\n   - For \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( s = -\\frac{5}{2} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(-\\frac{5}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{45}{8}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\) and \\( s = \\frac{17}{6} \\), it does not satisfy \\( r^2s = -\\frac{45}{8} \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUpon recalculating and verifications, I found that the correct value of \\( r \\) is indeed \\( \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}} \\). This satisfies all the given conditions, particularly \\( r^2s = -\\frac{45}{8} \\), making it consistent with the polynomial's factorization.",
