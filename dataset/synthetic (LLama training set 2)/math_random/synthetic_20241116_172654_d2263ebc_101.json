    "working_out": "**Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's start by really understanding what the problem is asking. Margo walks to her friend\u2019s house and back home using the same route. The time it takes to go to the friend\u2019s house is different (10 minutes) from the time it takes to return home (20 minutes). We're told her average speed for the entire trip is 4 miles per hour, and we need to determine how many total miles she walked.\n\n**Initial Thoughts**\n\nFirst off, this looks like a problem involving average speed, total distance, and time. I remember that the average speed formula is quite useful in these situations:  \n\\[ \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\]\n\nGiven that her average speed is provided, the formula and these pieces of information might help find the total miles walked. The symmetry of the journey (same route) also seems important.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing Time and Speed**\n\nWhat immediately comes to mind is converting time from minutes to hours since the speed is in miles per hour. \n\n- Time to friend's house = 10 minutes = \\(\\frac{10}{60}\\) hours = \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) hour\n- Time back home = 20 minutes = \\(\\frac{20}{60}\\) hours = \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) hour\n\nTotal time for the entire trip is:  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Setting Up the Equations**\n\nNow I'll use the formula for average speed:  \n\\[ \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values, we have:  \n\\[ 4 = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\frac{1}{2}} \\]\n\nSolving for Total Distance:  \n\\[ \\text{Total Distance} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nSo, Margo walked a total of 2 miles in her entire trip. This feels right because the average speed, total time, and calculations align well.\n\n**Reflect and Check**\n\nWait, let me quickly check to make sure this makes sense. Since she walked to and from her friend's house along the same path:\n\n- Let the one-way distance be \\(d\\).\n- Total distance \\(= 2d\\).\n- Using the time calculations and the speed equation seems consistent with \\(d = 1\\) mile each way, thus \\(2d = 2\\).\n\nEverything seems to fit well, confirming Margo\u2019s round trip covered a total of 2 miles. No other details seem missing, and all calculations balance.\n\nHmm, this looks good. I\u2019m confident with this solution!",

  "ground_truth": "Margo walked for a total of $10+20=30$ minutes, or 0.5 hours.  To find the total distance traveled, we can multiply the total time by the rate: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{distance}&=\\text{rate}\\times \\text{time} \\\\\n&=0.5\\times 4 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{2}\\text{ miles}.\n\\end{align*}"
