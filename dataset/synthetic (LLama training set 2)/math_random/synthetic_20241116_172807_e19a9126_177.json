    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive in and dissect this problem thoroughly step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what's being asked. We know that \\(x^2\\) and \\(y\\) vary inversely. This means when one increases, the other decreases in such a way that their product remains constant. We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\n\\[ x^2 \\cdot y = k \\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is a constant.\n\nWe are given a specific condition: \\(y = 10\\) when \\(x = 2\\). We're asked to find \\(x\\) when \\(y = 4000\\).\n\n### Brainstorming Approaches\nAt first glance:\n- We have the inverse variation relationship to utilize.\n- We need to identify \\(k\\) using the initial condition.\n- With \\(k\\) known, we can find \\(x\\) for the new value of \\(y\\).\n\nIt seems straightforward, but let's keep an eye out for any tricky parts.\n\n### Finding the Constant \\(k\\)\nUsing the initial condition (\\(y = 10\\), \\(x = 2\\)):\n\n1. Substitute \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 10\\) into the inverse relationship:\n   \\[\n   (2^2) \\cdot 10 = k \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4 \\cdot 10 = k \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k = 40\n   \\]\n\nHmm, seems like I calculated the constant \\(k\\) to be 40 correctly. Let's move on.\n\n### Solving for \\(x\\) When \\(y = 4000\\)\nNow, let's use the relationship \\(x^2 \\cdot y = 40\\) with the new value of \\(y = 4000\\).\n\n1. Substitute \\(y = 4000\\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   x^2 \\cdot 4000 = 40\n   \\]\n2. Solve for \\(x^2\\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 = \\frac{40}{4000}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x^2 = \\frac{1}{100}\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\(x\\) by taking the square root:\n   \\[\n   x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{100}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1}{10}\n   \\]\n\n### Reflecting and Checking\nLet's check if our solution makes sense:\n- In our calculations, \\(x = \\frac{1}{10}\\). This represents a quite small number. The intuition that \\(x\\) should be small makes sense\u2014the inverse relationship means if \\(y\\) increases significantly, \\(x^2\\) must decrease significantly.\n\nFinal Calculation Reflection:\n- Initially, I computed values correctly for \\(k\\).\n- The final result \\(x = \\frac{1}{10}\\) feels reasonable. It's good practice to evaluate whether the numbers \"feel\" right.\n\nRechecking the relationship:\n- Plugging back into the original condition: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^2 \\cdot 4000\\) should equal 40. \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{100} \\cdot 4000 = 40\n   \\]\n- It checks out. Phew!\n\n### Conclusion\nThis confirms that \\(x = \\frac{1}{10}\\) is indeed the correct solution when \\(y = 4000\\). This process reveals how breaking a problem into structured steps can ensure clarity and accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $x^2$ and $y$ are inversely proportional, their product is constant.  Thus $$2^2 \\cdot 10 = x^2 \\cdot 4000 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad x = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}.$$"
