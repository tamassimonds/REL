    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into simplifying the expression \\(5x + 6 - x + 12\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst thoughts: This looks like a straightforward algebra problem where we're asked to simplify the expression by combining like terms. I've done problems like this before where the goal is mainly to gather terms with the same variable together. Sounds familiar, and I think I can handle it.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Like Terms\nMy initial approach is to look for like terms. I notice that the expression consists of terms involving \\(x\\) and constant terms. So, \\(5x\\) and \\(-x\\) are like terms because they both have the variable \\(x\\). Similarly, \\(6\\) and \\(12\\) are constants, meaning they can be combined.\n\n### Step 3: Combine Like Terms\nLet's tackle the \\(x\\) terms first.\n- The expression has \\(5x\\) and \\(-x\\). \n- I know from basic algebra that these can be combined by performing the subtraction: \\(5x - x = 4x\\).\n\nNow let's handle the constant terms:\n- The constant terms are \\(6\\) and \\(12\\).\n- Adding these together should give \\(6 + 12 = 18\\).\n\n### Step 4: Bringing It All Together\nSo, if I combine the simplified \\(x\\) term and the constant term, the expression becomes:\n\\[ 4x + 18 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Check the Work\nHmm, let me quickly review these steps to ensure accuracy:\n- The combination of like \\(x\\) terms, \\(5x - x\\), is definitely correct, resulting in \\(4x\\).\n- Adding the constants \\(6\\) and \\(12\\) to get \\(18\\) is straightforward and seems correct too.\n\nEverything adds up, and nothing seems off the mark. This should be the simplest form of the expression.\n\n### Final Thought\nThe important part was making sure to group the terms correctly and to be cautious with the signs during subtraction. This was a good refresher on simplifying expressions, focusing on combining like terms step by step. Feels satisfying to get to \\(4x + 18\\) as the simplified expression. \n\nIf there's a quicker method to check for general correctness, it could involve substituting a random value for \\(x\\) into both the original and simplified expressions to ensure they remain equal. However, with such direct simplification here, it seems unnecessary unless further verification is needed.",
