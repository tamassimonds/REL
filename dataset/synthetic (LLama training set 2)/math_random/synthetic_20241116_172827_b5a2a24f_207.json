    "working_out": "Okay, let's tackle this problem by breaking it down step by step, just like I would if I were figuring it out on paper.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of \\(9^{2004}\\). Immediately, this feels like it's about understanding the last two digits of a large power of 9, since only those will affect the tens and units place.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- This reminds me of a classic modular arithmetic problem where you often calculate something modulo 100 to find the last two digits.\n- I could try to compute \\(9^{2004} \\mod 100\\) to determine the last two digits directly.\n\n**Step 2: Break Down the Problem**\n\nThinking about \\(9^{2004}\\), multiplying huge powers isn't practical. Instead, let's explore if there's a simpler way through patterns or reductions:\n\n**Strategy Brainstorm:**\n\n1. **Modular Pattern Recognition:**\n   - Check if there's a repeating pattern in the last two digits of powers of 9.\n   - Compute \\(9^n \\mod 100\\) for small values of \\(n\\), hoping a pattern appears.\n\n2. **Use Number Theoretical Tools:**\n   - Euler's Theorem: It states that \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\\) for coprime \\(a\\) and \\(n\\).\n   - Here \\(n = 100\\), and \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\).\n   - Thus, \\(9^{40} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}\\). Use this to simplify \\(9^{2004}\\).\n\n**Step 3: Find the Pattern**\n\nLet's try the first option and calculate \\(9^n \\mod 100\\) manually for small \\(n\\):\n\n- \\(9^1 = 9\\), so \\(9^1 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{100}\\)\n- \\(9^2 = 81\\), so \\(9^2 \\equiv 81 \\pmod{100}\\)\n- \\(9^3 = 729\\), then \\(729 \\mod 100 = 29\\)\n- \\(9^4 = 6561\\), then \\(6561 \\mod 100 = 61\\)\n- \\(9^5 = 59049\\), then \\(59049 \\mod 100 = 49\\)\n- \\(9^6 = 531441\\), then \\(531441 \\mod 100 = 41\\)\n- \\(9^7 = 4782969\\), then \\(4782969 \\mod 100 = 69\\)\n- \\(9^8 = 43046721\\), then \\(43046721 \\mod 100 = 21\\)\n- \\(9^9 = 387420489\\), then \\(387420489 \\mod 100 = 89\\) \n- Now, for \\(9^{10}\\): \n  - \\(9^{10} = 3486784401\\), then \\(3486784401 \\mod 100 = 1\\)\n  - This suggests a repeating cycle every 10 terms!\n\n**Aha Moment:**\n\n- Since \\(9^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}\\), we can conclude the sequence of last two digits repeats every 10 powers.\n- So I should check where \\(2004\\) lands in this cycle.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Pattern**\n\nGiven \\(9^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}\\), we simplify \\(9^{2004}\\):\n\n- \\(2004 \\mod 10 = 4\\)\n- Thus, \\(9^{2004} \\equiv 9^4 \\pmod{100}\\)\n\nFrom our earlier calculations, \\(9^4 \\equiv 61 \\pmod{100}\\).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Digits' Sum**\n\nThe last two digits are \\(61\\).\n- Thus, the tens digit is \\(6\\) and the units digit is \\(1\\).\n- The sum of the digits is \\(6 + 1 = 7\\).\n\n**Step 6: Reflect**\n\nEverything checks out with the cycle and my application of patterns. It's logical and consistent with modular arithmetic principles.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "Write $9$ as $10-1$ and consider raising 9 to the 2004 power by multiplying out the expression \\[\n\\overbrace{(10-1)(10-1)(10-1)\\cdots(10-1)}^{2004\\text{ factors}}\n\\] There will be $2^{2004}$ terms in this expansion (one for each way to choose either 10 or $-1$ for each of the 2004 factors of $(10-1)$), but most of them will not affect the tens or units digit because they will have two or more factors of 10 and therefore will be divisible by 100.  Only the 2004 terms of $-10$ which come from choosing $-1$ in 2003 of the factors and 10 in the remaining one as well as the term $(-1)^{2004}=1$ remain.  Let $N$ represent the sum of all of the terms with more than 1 factor of 10.  We have \\begin{align*}\n(10-1)^{2004}&=N+2004(-10)+1\\\\\n&= N-20,\\!040+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-40+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-39.\n\\end{align*} So $9^{2004}$ is 39 less than a multiple of 100 and therefore ends in 61.  The sum of 6 and 1 is $\\boxed{7}$."
