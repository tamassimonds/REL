    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step by step.\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- I'm dealing with two functions: \\(\\delta(x) = 3x + 8\\) and \\(\\phi(x) = 8x + 7\\).\n- The task is to find \\(x\\) such that \\(\\delta(\\phi(x)) = 7\\). This looks like a composition of functions problem.\n- Composition of functions means plugging one function into another. So here, I need to plug \\(\\phi(x)\\) into \\(\\delta(x)\\).\n\nHmmm, let's try breaking it down:\n\nStep 1: Set up the composition\n- I need to determine \\(\\delta(\\phi(x))\\).\n- Replace \\(x\\) in \\(\\delta(x) = 3x + 8\\) with \\(\\phi(x)\\). So, \\(\\delta(\\phi(x)) = 3(\\phi(x)) + 8\\).\n\nStep 2: Substitute \\(\\phi(x)\\)\n- Since \\(\\phi(x) = 8x + 7\\), substitute it into the expression from Step 1:\n  \\[\n  \\delta(\\phi(x)) = 3(8x + 7) + 8\n  \\]\n\nStep 3: Simplify the expression\n- Expand the terms:\n  \\[\n  3(8x + 7) = 3 \\times 8x + 3 \\times 7 = 24x + 21\n  \\]\n- Now add 8:\n  \\[\n  24x + 21 + 8 = 24x + 29\n  \\]\n\nStep 4: Solve for \\(x\\)\n- I need \\(\\delta(\\phi(x))\\) to equal 7. Set up the equation:\n  \\[\n  24x + 29 = 7\n  \\]\n\nStep 5: Isolate \\(x\\)\n- Subtract 29 from both sides:\n  \\[\n  24x = 7 - 29 = -22\n  \\]\n- Then divide by 24:\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{-22}{24} = -\\frac{11}{12}\n  \\]\n\nGreat! \\(x = -\\frac{11}{12}\\) seems like a plausible solution. Now, let's do a quick check to ensure it's correct.\n\nCheck:\n- Find \\(\\phi(x)\\) for \\(x = -\\frac{11}{12}\\):\n  \\[\n  \\phi\\left(-\\frac{11}{12}\\right) = 8\\left(-\\frac{11}{12}\\right) + 7 = -\\frac{88}{12} + \\frac{84}{12} = -\\frac{88}{12} + \\frac{84}{12} = -\\frac{4}{12} = -\\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n\n- Use this in \\(\\delta(x)\\):\n  \\[\n  \\delta\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 3\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + 8 = -1 + 8 = 7\n  \\]\n\nPerfect! The calculation checks out. It looks like our solution \\(x = -\\frac{11}{12}\\) is indeed correct.",

  "ground_truth": "We can see that $\\delta(\\phi(x)) = 3(8x + 7) + 8 = 24x + 29.$ Therefore, we have that $24x + 29 = 7$, giving us $24x = -22.$ Therefore, $x = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{11}{12}}.$"
