If it comes up heads, I win 1 dollar.  If it comes up tails, I win 3 dollars.  But if it lands on its edge, I lose 5 dollars.  What is the expected winnings from flipping this coin?

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n### Initial Understanding\n\nFirst thoughts: This problem looks similar to expected value calculations I've done before, where you weigh outcomes by their probabilities. Here, we have a weighted coin, so we expect some calculation involving weighted averages.\n\nLet's lay out what we're trying to calculate:\n- **Expected winnings**: The average amount of money I can expect to win (or lose) per flip of the coin, considering the probabilities of each outcome.\n\n### Break Down the Problem\n\nThe coin has three outcomes, with associated probabilities:\n- Heads: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) probability, and I win $1. \n- Tails: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) probability, and I win $3.\n- Edge: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) probability, and I lose $5.\n\nWe need to calculate an expected value, which suggests using the formula:\n\n\\[ E(X) = \\sum (x_i \\times p_i) \\]\n\nWhere \\( x_i \\) are the results of each outcome, and \\( p_i \\) are their respective probabilities.\n\n### Detailed Calculation\n\nLet's plug the information into the formula:\n\n1. **Heads outcome:**\n   - Probability \\( p_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n   - Winnings \\( x_1 = 1 \\) dollar\n   - Contribution to expectation = \\( p_1 \\times x_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = 0.5 \\)\n\n2. **Tails outcome:**\n   - Probability \\( p_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n   - Winnings \\( x_2 = 3 \\) dollars\n   - Contribution to expectation = \\( p_2 \\times x_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3 = 1 \\)\n\n3. **Edge outcome:**\n   - Probability \\( p_3 = \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n   - Loss \\( x_3 = -5 \\) dollars (since it's a loss)\n   - Contribution to expectation = \\( p_3 \\times x_3 = \\frac{1}{6} \\times (-5) = -\\frac{5}{6} \\approx -0.8333 \\)\n\n### Summing It Up\n\nNow, let's sum these contributions to find the total expected value:\n\n\\[ E(X) = 0.5 + 1 + (-0.8333) \\]\n\nI'll add these up:\n\n- \\( 0.5 + 1 = 1.5 \\)\n- \\( 1.5 + (-0.8333) = 0.6667 \\)\n\nSo, the expected winnings per flip of the coin is approximately \\( 0.6667 \\) dollars.\n\n### Reflection\n\nLet's reflect on this: \n- I got a positive value, which means, on average, I can expect to win money with each flip.\n- This makes sense given the probabilities and winnings/loss considered.\n\nI'm considering rounding this dollar value to the nearest cent as a final touch. So, the expected winnings rounded to the nearest cent is $0.67.\n\nGreat! That feels right given the process. If I had noticed a negative expectation or a wild swing in numbers, I would have rechecked my probabilities and calculations as those might indicate an error or misinterpretation of the winning or losing amounts.\n\nI hope this problem-solving flow provided a clear sequence of logical steps, and conveyed the process of reaching an answer effectively!",
