    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and really get into the problem-solving mindset. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nCory has 7 pieces of fruit in total: 3 apples (A), 2 oranges (O), and 2 bananas (B). He'll eat one fruit per day for a week, and we need to compute the number of different orders in which he can consume them. Each fruit within its category is indistinguishable from the others.\n\nThis problem inherently involves combinatorics because we're dealing with permutations of a multiset.\n\n### Brainstorming Possible Approaches\n1. **Direct Enumeration**: Not practical due to the large number of combinations.\n2. **Permutation with Repetition**: This is usually a go-to method for determining arrangements of items where there are repeated elements.\n3. **Use a Formula**: There might be a known formula for permutation of multisets.\n4. **Recursive Counting/Choosing**: Maybe break it down day by day, but that sounds unnecessarily complicated.\n\nConsidering these, permutation with repetition seems to be the appropriate approach. Each type of fruit (A, O, B) appears more than once, resembling a typical permutation problem with repeated elements.\n\n### Settling on a Method\n\nWe can use the formula for permutations of a multiset:\n\\[ \n\\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times \\dots \\times n_k!} \n\\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of elements to arrange, and \\( n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k \\) are the counts of each identical item.\n\n### Executing the Plan\n\n1. **Total Number of Fruits**: 7 (3 apples, 2 oranges, 2 bananas)\n  \n2. **Plug into the Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of ways} = \\frac{7!}{3! \\times 2! \\times 2!}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate 7!**:\n   \\[\n   7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate 3!, 2!, and 2!**:\n   - \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\)\n   - \\( 2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\) (Note there are two occurrences of 2!)\n\n5. **Calculate the Denominator**:\n   \\[\n   3! \\times 2! \\times 2! = 6 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 24\n   \\]\n\n6. **Complete the Division**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5040}{24} = 210\n   \\]\n\n### Reflecting and Verifying\n\nOkay, let's take a step back. This approach seems solid because we've covered all repetitions by dividing out the factorials for the apples, oranges, and bananas. The formula checks out with how permutations of indistinguishable objects are typically approached in combinatorics.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter reflecting on this, I\u2019m confident the solution is correct. Cory can eat his fruits in **210** different possible orders. This approach aligns with the structure of the problem, and the calculations have checked out cleanly. Nothing seems off with this conclusion.\n\nIf you have any other questions or want further details on any of these steps, feel free to ask!",

  "ground_truth": "There are a total of $7$ fruits, so there are $7!$ ways to arrange them. However, since the fruits in each category are indistinguishable, we must divide out the repeats: $$\\frac{7!}{3!2!2!}=7\\times6\\times5=\\boxed{210}.$$"
