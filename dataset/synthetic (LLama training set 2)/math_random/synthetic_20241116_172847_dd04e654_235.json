    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem where we need to find a number to add to a complex number, \\(3 - 5i\\), in order to arrive at another complex number, \\(2 + 7i\\). We'll approach this systematically, exploring different strategies along the way.\n\n**First Thoughts and Brainstorming:**\n\n- Right away, this problem reminds me of situations where I need to solve equations with variables, except here, we\u2019re dealing with complex numbers.\n- My initial thought is that I need to add two complex numbers, so I should probably break them down into their real and imaginary parts and handle those separately.\n- Since complex numbers can be seen as vectors in a 2D plane with real and imaginary axes, maybe thinking in terms of \"components\" like in physics could help.\n\n**Exploring a Strategy:**\n\n1. **Basic Equation Setup:**\n\n   We are looking for a complex number \\( x + yi \\) such that:\n\n   \\[\n   (3 - 5i) + (x + yi) = 2 + 7i\n   \\]\n\n   This suggests I can separate and equate the real and imaginary parts of the equation, as they have to be equal on both sides for the equality to hold.\n\n2. **Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n\n   - For the real parts, we have: \n     \\[\n     3 + x = 2\n     \\]\n\n   - For the imaginary parts, we have:\n     \\[\n     -5 + y = 7\n     \\]\n\n**Solving the Equations:**\n\n3. **Real part equation:**\n   \\[\n   3 + x = 2\n   \\]\n\n   Solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 2 - 3 = -1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Imaginary part equation:**\n   \\[\n   -5 + y = 7\n   \\]\n\n   Solve for \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = 7 + 5 = 12\n   \\]\n\n5. **Construct the Result:**\n\n   So, the complex number we need to add is \\(-1 + 12i\\).\n\n**Checking the Answer:**\n\n- I\u2019ll quickly check my work as it feels natural to do so:\n\n  Add the original number \\((3 - 5i)\\) and the number I found \\((-1 + 12i)\\) and see if I arrive at \\((2 + 7i)\\):\n\n  - Combine real parts: \\( 3 + (-1) = 2 \\)\n  - Combine imaginary parts: \\(-5 + 12 = 7\\)\n\n  Both the real and imaginary parts match the target, \\(2 + 7i\\).\n\n- This confirms that our solution is correct. \n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Initially, I wondered if any more complex strategies would be needed, like perhaps visualizing this on an Argand diagram. However, breaking it down into real and imaginary components worked very directly.\n- This recall aligns with typical algebraic manipulation, just translated into a complex number context.\n\nIn conclusion, we need to add \\(-1 + 12i\\) to \\(3 - 5i\\) in order to obtain \\(2 + 7i\\). I feel good about this approach as I've double-checked the arithmetic and comparisons, ensuring consistency and correctness in the final result.",
