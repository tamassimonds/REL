    "working_out": "**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, we're dealing with integers in base 10 and we need to express them in base 4 before performing addition. The problem is interesting because it requires a change of number system. At first glance, this reminds me of conversion exercises from math classes. Converting between bases isn't something I do often, so let me break it down step-by-step.\n\nThe numbers given are 195 and 61. I need to convert each of these from base 10 (our usual number system) to base 4.\n\n**Step 1: Convert 195 to Base 4**\n\nTo convert a number from base 10 to base 4, I need to divide the number by 4 and keep track of the remainders. The remainders will give me the digits of the number in base 4, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost).\n\n1. Divide 195 by 4:\n   - \\(195 \\div 4 = 48\\) remainder 3.\n\n2. Take 48 and divide by 4:\n   - \\(48 \\div 4 = 12\\) remainder 0.\n\n3. Take 12 and divide by 4:\n   - \\(12 \\div 4 = 3\\) remainder 0.\n\n4. Finally, divide 3 by 4:\n   - \\(3 \\div 4 = 0\\) remainder 3.\n\nSo, writing the remainders from bottom to top gives 195 in base 4 as \\(3003_4\\).\n\n**Step 2: Convert 61 to Base 4**\n\nNow, using the same method to convert 61.\n\n1. Divide 61 by 4:\n   - \\(61 \\div 4 = 15\\) remainder 1.\n\n2. Take 15 and divide by 4:\n   - \\(15 \\div 4 = 3\\) remainder 3.\n\n3. Divide 3 by 4:\n   - \\(3 \\div 4 = 0\\) remainder 3.\n\nTherefore, 61 in base 4 is \\(331_4\\).\n\n**Step 3: Add the Base 4 Numbers**\n\nNext, I add the two numbers \\(3003_4\\) and \\(331_4\\) directly in base 4.\n\nStarting from the rightmost column:\n\n1. Rightmost column: \\(3 + 1 = 4\\). In base 4, 4 is represented as \\(10\\), so I write 0 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Next column: \\(0 + 3 = 3\\), plus the carry of 1 gives 4 again, so write 0, carry over 1.\n\n3. Next column: \\(0 + 3 = 3\\), plus the carry of 1 gives 4 again, so write 0, carry over 1.\n\n4. Last column: \\(3\\), plus the carry of 1 gives 4 again. But since there's no next column, I write 10 directly in that position.\n\nPutting it all together, the sum of \\(3003_4\\) and \\(331_4\\) is \\(10000_4\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense because the carries accumulated correctly across the digits based on the base 4 calculations. The methodical conversion and careful addition helped ensure accuracy.\n\nThis must be correct since all calculations were checked step-by-step. Also, given the pattern, a higher-value base 4 number means the addition is likely substantial, so reaching a sum that's a multiple of 4-basic numbers seems consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sum of 195 and 61, when converted and added in base 4, is \\(10000_4\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since changing the base does not change the underlying quantity being represented, the sum of the base-4 representations of 195 and 61 is the same as the base-4 representation of 195+61.  Recognizing that 195+61=256 is a power of 4, we put 1 in the place whose value is $4^4$ and 0 in the remaining places to obtain the sum $\\boxed{10000}$."
