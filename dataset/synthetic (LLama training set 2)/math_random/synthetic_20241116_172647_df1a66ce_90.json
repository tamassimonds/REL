We need to find \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\n### Brainstorming Possible Strategies:\n1. **Substitution or Elimination:** Use either substitution or elimination to find relationships between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n2. **Identify Patterns:** Notice any patterns between coefficients or try to make equations simpler.\n3. **Geometric Interpretation:** Consider if these lines are parallel, intersect, or are the same.\n4. **Trial and Error:** Test simple values to find direct relationships.\n\nHmm... My gut feeling is to attempt elimination first since both equations seem to have coefficients of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that are quite related. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Simplification and Elimination\n- I notice both equations might simplify since they have common factors. Let's simplify the coefficients provided we don't alter the equality.\n\nFor the first equation:\n\\[ \n6x - 4y = a \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3x - 2y = \\frac{a}{2} \\quad \\text{(dividing entire equation by 2)}\n\\]\n\nFor the second equation:\n\\[ \n6y - 9x = b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2y - 3x = \\frac{b}{3} \\quad \\text{(dividing entire equation by 3)}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Reorganize Expressions\nRewriting:\n\\[\n3x - 2y = \\frac{a}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n-3x + 2y = \\frac{b}{3}\n\\]\n\nWait... looking at these new simplified equations:\nAdding these equations directly, I notice:\n\\[\n(3x - 2y) + (-3x + 2y) = \\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{b}{3}\n\\]\nThese cancel directly to:\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{b}{3}\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{2} = -\\frac{b}{3}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Solve for \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\)\nFrom above, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{2} = -\\frac{b}{3}\n\\]\nCross multiply to solve for \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\):\n\\[\n3a = -2b\n\\]\nThat can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Final Check:\n- Let's reanalyze the cancellation: They indeed confirm \\(6y - 9x\\) = \\(-1\\) times \\(6x - 4y\\), highlighting equivalency after scaling and the solution possibility as given (\\(a/b\\) can be factored consistently here).\n  \nAs expected, my reasoning appears logically consistent: \\(\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\) and assured since no redundancy error, as both need to be verified and consistently related as done throughout any conflicting outcome.\n\nI am confident in this approach and answer, and it all checks out!",
