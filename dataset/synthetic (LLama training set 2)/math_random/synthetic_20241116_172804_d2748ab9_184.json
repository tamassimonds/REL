    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. The equation we're dealing with is:\n\n\\[3x^3 - x^2 - 20x + 27 = 0.\\]\n\nOur goal is to find the product of the roots of this cubic polynomial. \n\n**First thoughts:**\n\n- Whenever I see \"product of roots\" for a polynomial, Vieta's formulas come to mind. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. \n\n- For a cubic polynomial \\(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\\), the product of the roots \\(r_1, r_2, r_3\\) is given by \\(-\\frac{d}{a}\\).\n\n- This equation looks pretty standard, so let's try applying Vieta's formula directly:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the coefficients:**\n\nLooking at the polynomial:\n\n- \\(a = 3\\): This is the coefficient of \\(x^3\\).\n- \\(b = -1\\): This is the coefficient of \\(x^2\\).\n- \\(c = -20\\): This is the coefficient of \\(x\\).\n- \\(d = 27\\): This is the constant term.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the product of the roots:**\n\nAccording to Vieta's formulas for a cubic polynomial \\(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\\), the product of the roots \\(r_1 \\cdot r_2 \\cdot r_3 = -\\frac{d}{a}\\).\n\n- Plugging in the values: \n\n  \\[\n  r_1 \\cdot r_2 \\cdot r_3 = -\\frac{27}{3} = -9\n  \\]\n\n**Reflecting and checking:**\n\n- The product calculation seems straightforward and checks out with Vieta's formulas. I've double-checked the assignment of coefficients and the application of the formula.\n\n- Let's briefly consider our approach: I went straight to Vieta's formulas because they are perfect for such questions involving sums and products of roots. There wasn't a need to calculate the roots explicitly, which could be cumbersome given this cubic equation might not factor easily or have simple rational roots.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe product of the roots of the equation \\(3x^3 - x^2 - 20x + 27 = 0\\) is \\(-9\\). This seems correct as per the formulas and the process described. \n\nIf I wanted to further confirm, I might look into solving the cubic directly through methods like factoring (if feasible) or using tools like the cubic formula, but this seems unnecessary here given the clarity and simplicity of Vieta\u2019s formulas for this task.",

  "ground_truth": "By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is the negation of the constant term divided by the leading ($x^3$) coefficient. Therefore, the answer is \\[\\frac{-27}{3} = \\boxed{-9}.\\](Don't forget to divide by the leading coefficient of the polynomial!)"
