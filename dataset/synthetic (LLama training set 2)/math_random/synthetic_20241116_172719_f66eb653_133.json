    "working_out": "### Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. We have a quadratic expression: \\(5x^2 - 20x + 1357\\). I'm trying to recall if I've seen anything like this before. Ah, it reminds me of finding the minimum or maximum values of quadratic expressions using some formulas from calculus or algebra classes. \n\nQuadratic expressions of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) will have a minimum if their leading coefficient (\\(a\\)) is positive. Here, \\(a = 5\\), which is positive, so this expression will have a minimum value.\n\n### Brainstorming Approaches\n\n1. **Derivative Method**: I could use calculus, find the derivative, set it to zero, and solve for \\(x\\). This should give the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, which, in this case, corresponds to the minimum.\n2. **Completing the Square**: Another method is completing the square to put the quadratic in vertex form. This is a bit algebra-intensive but might give more insight here.\n3. **Vertex Formula**: There\u2019s also the vertex formula for a parabola \\(x = -\\frac{b}{2a}\\), which quickly gives the x-coordinate for the minimum point when the parabola opens upwards.\n\nHmm, option 3 seems like a quick and effective approach. Let's start with that and keep others in mind as backup.\n\n### Using the Vertex Formula\n\n1. **Finding the x-coordinate of the vertex**:\n   - The formula \\(x = -\\frac{b}{2a}\\) will give the x-coordinate of the vertex. For \\(5x^2 - 20x + 1357\\), let's assign the values:\n     - \\(a = 5\\)\n     - \\(b = -20\\)\n   - Plug these into the formula:\n     \\[\n     x = -\\frac{-20}{2 \\times 5} = \\frac{20}{10} = 2\n     \\]\n   \n   This means \\(x = 2\\) is where the function reaches its minimum.\n\n2. **Finding the minimum value**:\n   - Now substitute \\(x = 2\\) back into \\(5x^2 - 20x + 1357\\) to find the minimum value:\n   \\[\n   f(2) = 5(2)^2 - 20(2) + 1357\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 5 \\times 4 - 40 + 1357\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 20 - 40 + 1357\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = -20 + 1357\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 1337\n   \\]\n\n### Reflecting and Verifying\n\n- Okay, that gives a minimum value of 1337 for the expression. Let me do a quick sanity check: does this make sense?\n  - I used the correct formulas and algebraic steps. The numbers all seem right. The quadratic was correctly identified as opening upwards, which aligns with finding a minimum at \\(x=2\\).\n  - Rechecking the value substitution into the function doesn't reveal any mistakes.\n\nThis minimum value of \\(5x^2 - 20x + 1357\\) has turned out to be **1337** when \\(x = 2\\). Try as I might to doubt it, every step checks out. Voil\u00e0!",

  "ground_truth": "Let $y=5x^2 -20x + 1357$.  First, complete the square as follows: $y=5x^2-20x+1357=5(x^2-4x)+1357$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{2}\\right)^2=4$ after the $-4x$. So we have $y+20=5\\left(x^2-4x+4\\right)+1357$. This gives $y=5\\left(x-2\\right)^2+1337$.\n\nNow, since $\\left(x-2\\right)^2\\ge0$, the minimum value is when the squared term is equal to $0$.  So the minimum value is $y=5\\left(x-2\\right)^2+1337=5\\cdot0+1337=\\boxed{1337}$."
