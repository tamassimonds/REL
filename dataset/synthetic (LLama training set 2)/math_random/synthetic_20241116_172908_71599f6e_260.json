    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem involving triangle geometry. The problem states that \\(\\Delta ABC\\) is isosceles with \\(AC = BC\\), and we're given \\(m\\angle C = 40^\\circ\\). We need to find the measure of \\(\\angle CBD\\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand and Diagram the Problem**\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the question clearly. I have a triangle \\(ABC\\) that is isosceles with sides \\(AC = BC\\). The given angle at vertex \\(C\\) is \\(40^\\circ\\). The task is to find out the measure of \\(\\angle CBD\\). \n\nI'll also consider where point \\(D\\) is: it seems like it's expected to lie on \\(AB\\), or extend \\(AB\\) in some manner. The Asymptote figure suggests \\(D\\) is on the line \\(BE\\) which is possibly part of or extends the base of the triangle. I should keep this in mind as I proceed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Known Information**\n\nSince \\(\\Delta ABC\\) is isosceles with \\(AC = BC\\), it follows that the base angles, \\(\\angle BAC\\) and \\(\\angle ABC\\), must be equal. Let's denote each of these angles as \\(x\\).\n\nNow, using the triangle angle sum property \\(\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ\\), we can write:\n\n\\[ \nx + x + 40^\\circ = 180^\\circ \n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for x**\n\nI can simplify the above equation:\n\n\\[ \n2x + 40^\\circ = 180^\\circ \n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(40^\\circ\\) from both sides gives:\n\n\\[ \n2x = 140^\\circ \n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2, I find:\n\n\\[ \nx = 70^\\circ \n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\angle BAC = \\angle ABC = 70^\\circ\\).\n\n**Step 4: Determine \\(\\angle CBD\\)**\n\nTo find \\(\\angle CBD\\), I need a deeper look into the points.\nIf \\(D\\) is on the extension of \\(AB\\), then \\(\\angle CBD\\) can be interpreted as an exterior angle to \\(\\Delta ABC\\) at \\(B\\). For an exterior angle of a triangle, the measure of an exterior angle (\\(\\angle CBD\\)) is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.\n\nThus:\n\n\\[ \nm \\angle CBD = m \\angle BAC + m \\angle ACB \n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[ \nm \\angle CBD = 70^\\circ + 40^\\circ = 110^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Reflect on the Approach**\n\nThis makes sense because \\(\\angle CBD\\) being an exterior angle should be greater than either of the non-adjacent internal angles. 110 degrees, being greater than both 70 and 40 degrees, checks out. \n\nThis problem followed logically from leveraging the properties of isosceles triangles and triangle angle sums. Everything aligns correctly with geometric principles, so I feel confident in this result.\n\nTherefore, the measure of \\(\\angle CBD\\) is \\(\\boxed{110^\\circ}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of degrees in $\\angle ABC$. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles with $AC=BC$, we have $\\angle BAC=\\angle ABC$.\n\nSo, the three interior angles of $\\triangle ABC$ measure $x^\\circ$, $x^\\circ$, and $40^\\circ$. The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we have $$x+x+40 = 180,$$which we can solve to obtain $x=70$. Finally, $\\angle CBD$ is supplementary to angle $\\angle ABC$, so \\begin{align*}\nm\\angle CBD &= 180^\\circ - m\\angle ABC \\\\\n&= 180^\\circ - 70^\\circ \\\\\n&= \\boxed{110}^\\circ.\n\\end{align*}"
