    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Initially, the operation \\((a \\star b) = \\frac{a + b}{a - b}\\) seems straightforward, and our task is to evaluate \\(((1 \\star 2) \\star 4)\\). We will tackle this step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Operation\nFirst, I should ensure I understand the given operation. For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the operation \\((a \\star b)\\) results in the expression \\(\\frac{a + b}{a - b}\\). This essentially is a fraction where the numerator is the sum of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the denominator is their difference. \n\n### Step 2: Evaluate \\(1 \\star 2\\)\nLet's calculate \\(1 \\star 2\\) using the operation definition:\n\\[\n1 \\star 2 = \\frac{1 + 2}{1 - 2} = \\frac{3}{-1} = -3.\n\\]\nThe result of \\(1 \\star 2\\) is \\(-3\\).\n\nQuick check: Adding 1 and 2 gives 3 (correct), and subtracting 2 from 1 gives \\(-1\\) (correct), hence the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{-1}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate \\((-3) \\star 4\\)\nNow we need to use \\(1 \\star 2 = -3\\) as the first operand in another \\(\\star\\) operation, \\((-3) \\star 4\\). Let's calculate that:\n\\[\n(-3) \\star 4 = \\frac{-3 + 4}{-3 - 4} = \\frac{1}{-7} = -\\frac{1}{7}.\n\\]\nThis gives us \\(-\\frac{1}{7}\\) as the result of \\((-3) \\star 4\\).\n\n### Step 4: Verify Entire Expression \\(((1 \\star 2) \\star 4)\\)\nNow, combining the steps:\n1. Calculate \\(1 \\star 2 = -3\\).\n2. Calculate \\((-3) \\star 4 = -\\frac{1}{7}\\).\n\nSo, the overall expression evaluates to:\n\\[\n((1 \\star 2) \\star 4) = -\\frac{1}{7}.\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\nEach step involves straightforward arithmetic using the operation \\(\\star\\). I double-checked the arithmetic involved in both operations to ensure there were no mistakes in addition, subtraction, or fraction simplification. The final answer seems reasonable as there were no domain constraints breached by values like zero (denominator) within the calculations.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\[\n((1 \\star 2) \\star 4) = -\\frac{1}{7}.\n\\]\n\nI feel confident in this solution and the logical progression in evaluating the operation step by step.",
