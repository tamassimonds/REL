    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step. The task is to evaluate the expression \\( |\\omega^2 + 6\\omega + 58| \\) where \\(\\omega = 9 + 2i\\). \n\n### First Thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding the Task**: The expression involves a complex number \\(\\omega\\). We need to compute the polynomial expression involving \\(\\omega\\) and then determine the magnitude of the resulting complex number.\n2. **First Impression**: This seems similar to problems where we substitute a complex number into a polynomial and then find its modulus. The modulus of a complex number \\( a + bi \\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Substitution**: Start by substituting \\(\\omega = 9 + 2i\\) into the expression \\(\\omega^2 + 6\\omega + 58\\).\n2. **Compute \\(\\omega^2\\)**: Let's calculate \\((9 + 2i)^2\\):\n   \\[\n   (9 + 2i)^2 = 9^2 + 2 \\times 9 \\times 2i + (2i)^2 = 81 + 36i + 4i^2.\n   \\]\n   Now, recalling \\(i^2 = -1\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   81 + 36i + 4(-1) = 81 + 36i - 4 = 77 + 36i.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\(6\\omega\\)**: \n   \\[\n   6\\omega = 6(9 + 2i) = 54 + 12i.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine terms**: Now we can add these results into the expression:\n   \\[\n   \\omega^2 + 6\\omega + 58 = (77 + 36i) + (54 + 12i) + 58.\n   \\]\n   Let's combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   (77 + 54 + 58) + (36i + 12i) = 189 + 48i.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Modulus Calculation**: Now that we've simplified \\(\\omega^2 + 6\\omega + 58\\) to \\(189 + 48i\\), let's find its modulus:\n   \\[\n   |189 + 48i| = \\sqrt{189^2 + 48^2}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Compute the Squares**:\n   \\[\n   189^2 = 35721, \\quad 48^2 = 2304.\n   \\]\n   Add these up:\n   \\[\n   35721 + 2304 = 38025.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Finalize the Modulus**:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{38025}.\n   \\]\n\n8. **Square Root Calculation**:\n   After some trial and error or using a calculator, we find:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{38025} = 195.\n   \\]\n\n### Final Check\n\n- We recalculated each part separately, and each step logically followed from the previous one. \n- The calculations appear correct based on the usual methods for handling complex numbers.\n- Reassess the combination of the terms: everything checks out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe magnitude of the expression \\(|\\omega^2 + 6\\omega + 58|\\) when \\(\\omega = 9 + 2i\\) is \\(\\boxed{195}\\). \n\nThis structured approach, breaking down every step, confirms we are on solid feet with the solution. Let me know if there's another part you'd like to explore further!",

  "ground_truth": "It's certainly possible to just calculate the complex number $\\omega^2+6\\omega+58$ by just plugging in the value of $\\omega$, but it's computationally simpler to use the fact that $|ab|=|a|\\cdot|b|$ and our knowledge of factoring quadratics: \\begin{align*}\n|\\omega^2+6\\omega+58|&=|(\\omega+3+7i)(\\omega+3-7i)|\\\\\n&=|\\omega+3+7i|\\cdot|\\omega+3-7i|\\\\\n&=|12+9i|\\cdot|12-5i|\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{12^2+9^2}\\sqrt{12^2+(-5)^2}\\\\\n&=15\\cdot13\\\\\n&=\\boxed{195}\n\\end{align*}Note that we can get the factorization of the quadratic by either completing the square or (if you've learned it) applying the quadratic equation. Furthermore, knowledge of Pythagorean triples helps speed computations."
