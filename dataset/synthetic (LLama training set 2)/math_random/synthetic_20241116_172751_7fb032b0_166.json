    "working_out": "### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\nOkay, let's start by really understanding the question:\n\nWe are given that \\(x^2 = 16\\) and need to find the sum of all possible values of \\(x\\). Hmm, this looks like a quadratic equation since it involves \\(x^2\\). My first thought is that I've encountered problems like this before where I need to find the roots of such quadratic equations. For equations of the form \\(x^2 = a\\), it usually has two potential solutions. \n\nAs I recall, since I'm looking for real number solutions, if the right side is positive, \\(x\\) can often have both positive and negative values. In this case, \\(16\\) is positive, so that reassures me that \\(x\\) should have two real solutions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Identify the Equation**: \n\n   We start with the equation:\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 16\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the Square Root Property**:\n\n   My first instinct is to extract the square root of both sides to solve for \\(x\\). I remember that when dealing with squared terms, the principle of square roots means there can be both positive and negative solutions:\n   \\[\n   x = \\pm\\sqrt{16}\n   \\]\n   Calculating the square root, I find:\n   \\[\n   x = \\pm4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Listing Possible Values**:\n\n   Now that I've calculated \\(\\sqrt{16}\\), the possible values of \\(x\\) are:\n   \\[\n   x = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum of Possible Values**:\n\n   Since the question asks for the sum of all possible values, I should add these results:\n   \\[\n   4 + (-4) = 0\n   \\]\n\n### Verification\n\nBefore concluding, it's important to verify my findings. I had two values:\n- When \\(x = 4\\), substituting back into the original equation gives \\(4^2 = 16\\), which is correct.\n- When \\(x = -4\\), substituting gives \\((-4)^2 = 16\\), which also holds.\n\nBoth values satisfy the original equation, and I've checked my arithmetic. They add up to zero, which seems reasonable and matches my expectations for a symmetrical expression involving squared terms.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter checking and reflecting, I'm confident in my method and result. The sum of all possible values of \\(x\\) for the equation \\(x^2 = 16\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThis process has not only provided the solution but also reinforced my understanding of handling quadratic equations and extracting roots. Let me know if there's anything more you'd like to explore!",
