    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- The problem mentions a \"Marvelous Monday,\" which is the fifth Monday of any month. The task is to find the first such Monday after school begins.\n- School starts on Monday, September 4. I know that September has 30 days, so I need to figure out if this month could have a fifth Monday.\n- September 4 is the first Monday. I'll count the Mondays in September.\n\nExploring a Range of Strategies:\n1. **Count Mondays in September:**\n   - The first Monday is September 4.\n   - The second Monday is September 11.\n   - The third Monday is September 18.\n   - The fourth Monday is September 25.\n   - The next Monday after September 25 is October 2.\n   - Wait, September seems to only have four Mondays. October 2 is not in September.\n\n2. **Checking October for Five Mondays:**\n   - Since September doesn't have five Mondays, I need to look into October. I know this month has 31 days.\n   - October begins on a Sunday (because September 30 is a Saturday).\n   - The first Monday in October is October 2.\n   - The second Monday is October 9.\n   - The third Monday is October 16.\n   - The fourth Monday is October 23.\n   - The fifth Monday is October 30.\n\nChecking and Reflecting:\n- October 30 fits the condition of a Marvelous Monday because it's confirmed to be the fifth Monday of the month. I'm feeling confident that October 30 is the first Marvelous Monday after the school starts.\n- Briefly reconsider the sequence in case of any counting mistakes or overlooked details. No obvious errors here; the logic holds up well.\n\nChecking My Approach:\n- I started by breaking down the meaning of a Marvelous Monday correctly.\n- Checked two consecutive months carefully, verifying start-days and counting sequence accurately.\n- Realized the potential pitfall of mistakenly including an extra week.\n- Any issues with my date strategizing don't seem likely given the detailed weekday mapping.\n\nFinal Aha Moment:\n- Thinking of the possibility earlier for not stopping at September saved repeating this after a deeper dead-end.\n- Mapping out days gives clarity and reassurance in complex sequences, confirming October 30 as the Marvelous Monday.\n\nThe Answer:\n- The first Marvelous Monday after school starts is October 30.",

  "ground_truth": "September has 30 days.  September 4 is a Monday, so September 9 is a Saturday.  Since September 30 is exactly 21 days later (or 3 weeks), September 30 is also a Saturday.\n\nThen October 1 is a Sunday, and October 2 is a Monday.  Then October 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 are all Mondays, so the first Marvelous Monday is $\\boxed{\\text{October 30}}$."
