    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. We've got a right circular cone, and we need to find the circumference of its base. The only given pieces of information are that the volume is \\(12\\pi\\) cubic centimeters and the height is 4 cm. \n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Known Formulas**\n\n- The formula for the volume of a cone is:\n  \\[\n  V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n  \\]\n  where \\( V \\) is the volume, \\( r \\) is the radius of the base, and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n- We're given that \\( V = 12\\pi \\) and \\( h = 4 \\).\n\n- We need to find the circumference \\( C \\) of the base, which is given by \\( C = 2\\pi r \\).\n\n**Step 2: Use Given Information**\n\nLet's plug the given values into the volume formula:\n\n\\[\n12\\pi = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 \\times 4\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( r^2 \\)**\n\n- Simplify the equation:\n  \\[\n  12\\pi = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^2\n  \\]\n\n- Divide both sides by \\( \\pi \\) to simplify:\n  \\[\n  12 = \\frac{4}{3} r^2\n  \\]\n\nHmm, everything seems to be going smoothly so far. Let's solve for \\( r^2 \\).\n\n**Step 4: Isolate \\( r^2 \\)**\n\n- Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n  \\[\n  36 = 4r^2\n  \\]\n\n- Divide both sides by 4:\n  \\[\n  9 = r^2\n  \\]\n\n**Step 5: Solve for \\( r \\)**\n\n- Take the square root of both sides:\n  \\[\n  r = 3\n  \\]\n\nOkay, now we have the radius \\( r = 3 \\) cm. Let's calculate the circumference.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate Circumference**\n\n- Use the formula for circumference:\n  \\[\n  C = 2\\pi r = 2\\pi \\times 3 = 6\\pi\n  \\]\n\nNow it's time for a quick check:\n\n- Recalculate with \\( r = 3 \\) cm:\n  - Volume check: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times 3^2 \\times 4 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times 9 \\times 4 = 12\\pi\\)\n- That matches the given volume, so \\( r = 3 \\) cm is correct.\n\nThe circumference of the base is indeed \\( 6\\pi \\) cm.\n\n**Step 7: Reflect**\n\nEverything seems correct: the volume calculation checks out, and the circumference formula is applied correctly. I've validated that the derived radius satisfies the given conditions in the problem. This aligns well with the info provided and leads to a logical, verified solution. \n\nI think that's it. The final answer is that the circumference of the base of the cone is \\( 6\\pi \\) centimeters.",

  "ground_truth": "The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. We're given that the volume is $12\\pi$ and the height is $4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 = 12\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$. Therefore, the circumference of the base is $2\\pi r = \\boxed{6\\pi}$."
