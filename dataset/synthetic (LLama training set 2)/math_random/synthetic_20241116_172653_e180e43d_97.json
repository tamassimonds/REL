  "problem": "Cybil and Ronda are sisters. The 10 letters from their names are placed on identical cards so that each of 10 cards contains one letter. Without replacement, two cards are selected at random from the 10 cards. What is the probability that one letter is from each sister's name? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\nFirst, let's break down what the question is asking. We have two names, \"Cybil\" and \"Ronda\", which together give us a total of 10 letters. These letters are placed on cards and mixed up. We need to find the probability that when we select two cards, one card has a letter from \"Cybil\" and the other from \"Ronda\".\n\n### Step 2: Initial Thoughts\n- My initial thought is to find all possible ways to select two cards from these 10 cards, then determine how many of these selections have one letter from each name.\n- This looks similar to a combination problem, where I could use the formula for combinations to calculate the total possible pairs.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Ways to Choose Two Cards\n- There are 10 letters in total, five from each name. I need to calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 cards from these 10.\n- Using combinations: \\(\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\\).\n- So, there are 45 ways to select any 2 cards out of 10.\n\n### Step 4: Select One Letter from Each Name\n- Now, let's find how many ways we can select one letter from \"Cybil\" and one from \"Ronda\".\n- Since \"Cybil\" has 5 letters, there are \\(\\binom{5}{1} = 5\\) ways to select one letter from it.\n- \"Ronda\" also has 5 letters, so there are \\(\\binom{5}{1} = 5\\) ways to choose a letter from it.\n- Hence, there are \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) ways to choose one letter from \"Cybil\" and one letter from \"Ronda\".\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Probability\n- The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n- So here, it is \\(\\frac{25}{45}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Simplify the Fraction\n- I should simplify \\(\\frac{25}{45}\\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 25 and 45.\n- The GCD of 25 and 45 is 5.\n- So, \\(\\frac{25}{45} = \\frac{5}{9}\\).\n\n### Step 7: Reflect\n- Quick check: The names are distinct with no overlapping letters, so the logic of counting distinct letter combinations in Step 4 makes sense.\n- Double-checking simplifying: Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5 correctly gave \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe probability that one letter is from Cybil's name and one from Ronda's is \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\).\n\nThis seems correct per our calculations, and all steps check out logically. If there are no overlapping letters, the weirdness factor is nonexistent here, so \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\) is the neat solution!",

  "ground_truth": "The probability that the first letter selected will be from Cybil's name, and the second from Ronda's name, will be $\\frac{5}{10}\\cdot \\frac{5}{9}=\\frac{5}{18}$.  Similarly, the probability that the first letter will be from Ronda's name, and the second from Cybil's name, is also $\\frac{5}{10}\\cdot \\frac{5}{9}=\\frac{5}{18}$.  The probability that one letter will be selected from each name is then $\\frac{5}{18}+\\frac{5}{18}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$."
