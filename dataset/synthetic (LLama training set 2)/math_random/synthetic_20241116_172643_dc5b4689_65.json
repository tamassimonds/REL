    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem carefully and methodically. At first glance, it's clear that we're dealing with a functional equation. These can be tricky, so we need to proceed cautiously.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- The functional equation given is \\( f(x^2 + y f(z)) = x f(x) + z f(y) \\). At first sight, this is quite complex because it involves three variables: \\( x, y, z \\).\n- It feels similar to problems where you might plug in specific values to simplify or reveal more about the function. This kind of substitution strategy often helps in these problems.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorming:\n1. **Plugging in Simple Values:** A common approach is to start by substituting simple values such as \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = 0 \\), or \\( z = 0 \\). This often simplifies the problem and can lead to the discovery of key properties of the function.\n2. **Symmetry and Special Properties:** Looking for any symmetric properties or simplifying transformations.\n3. **Identify Known Function Forms:** Consider whether the functional form resembles that of linear, constant, or other known types of functions.\n\nNow, let's start with some computation by plugging in simple values to understand more about the structure of \\( f \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Exploration:\n\n#### Substitution 1: \\( x = 0 \\)\n\\[ f(0^2 + yf(z)) = 0 \\cdot f(0) + z f(y) \\]\n\\[ f(yf(z)) = z f(y) \\]\n\nThis equation suggests some form of proportionality or possibly a linear nature about \\( f \\). It might imply that \\( f \\) could be linear or certain degenerate cases like zero. Let's move to other substitutions to explore further.\n\n#### Substitution 2: \\( y = 0 \\)\n\\[ f(x^2 + 0 \\cdot f(z)) = x f(x) + z f(0) \\]\n\\[ f(x^2) = x f(x) + z f(0) \\]\n\nThis indicates that the value of \\( z f(0) \\) might often need to vanish to satisfy a standard form of the function.\n\n#### Substitution 3: \\( z = 0 \\)\n\\[ f(x^2 + y f(0)) = x f(x) + 0 \\cdot f(y) \\]\n\\[ f(x^2 + y f(0)) = x f(x) \\]\n\nThis is intriguing, particularly \\( f(0) \\) plays a consistent role in defining function inputs or vanishing terms, suggesting analyzing \\( f(0) \\) is crucial. \n\n#### Examine \\( f(0) \\):\nIf \\( f(0) \\neq 0 \\):\n- Substitution 3 becomes \\( f(x^2 + y f(0)) = x f(x) \\), leading to many possible inconsistencies for arbitrary \\( x, y, z \\). Thus a contradiction.\n\nHence, \\( f(0) = 0 \\).\n\n### Now, Consider constant functions:\nIn the simplest case if \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), the equation holds trivially. This is one possibility which requires careful validation against any other possibilities.\n\n### Search for Non-trivial Linear Features: \nLet's test if \\( f(x) \\) could be \\( cx \\), a linear function form, due to the structure and past substitutions:\n\nIf \\( f(x) = cx \\), plug into original:\n- Left: \\( f(x^2 + ycz) = c(x^2 + ycz) \\)\n- Right: \\( x(cx) + z(cy) = c(x^2 + yz) \\)\n\nMatching Left and Right confirms it works for any \\( c \\).\n\n### Conclusion (Reassuring Steps):\nThe function \\( f(x) = cx \\), where \\( c \\) is a constant satisfies the equation for all \\( x, y, z \\) along with the trivial solution \\( f(x) = 0 \\).\n\n### Analyzing \\( f(5) \\):\nSince \\( f(x) = cx \\), for \\( x = 5 \\), \\( f(5) = 5c \\).\n\nTwo key scenarios:\n- \\( c = 0 \\) gives \\( f(5) = 0 \\).\n- Any potential \\( c \\neq 0 \\) yields non-zero \\( f(5) \\).\n\nThe potential values are \\( f(5) = 0 \\) (one value) and potentially any real number derived from different constants (\\(\\infty\\) values).  However, the structure of the question asks for finite and countable possibilities.\n\n### Solution:\nConsidering only constant auto-references (aside from translations):\n- Number of distinct \\( f(5) \\): One (0).\n- Hence, \\( n \\times s = 1 \\times 0 = 0 \\).\n\nThe problem has been satisfactorily resolved following this pathway, confirming the mathematical consistency while checking the solution against logical deductions and substitutions carried out.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my analysis. Let's revisit the equation and carefully work through the possible solutions.\n\n### Re-evaluation of the Functional Equation\n\nThe functional equation is given by:\n\\[ f(x^2 + yf(z)) = xf(x) + zf(y) \\]\nfor all real numbers \\( x, y, z \\).\n\nTo solve this, let us strategically reconsider the earlier substitutions and delve deeper into the implications:\n\n1. **Revisiting Substitution 1: \\( x = 0 \\)**\n   \\[ f(yf(z)) = zf(y) \\]\n   This equation implies \\( f \\) has a multiplicative relationship involving \\( z \\), indicating a potential linear or identity-like transformation involved. Let\u2019s explore this more.\n\n2. **Revisiting Substitution 2: \\( y = 0 \\)**\n   \\[ f(x^2) = x f(x) + z f(0) \\]\n   Since we concluded earlier \\( f(0) = 0 \\), it simplifies to:\n   \\[ f(x^2) = x f(x) \\]\n   This implies a crucial insight: \\( f \\) might be homogeneous of degree 1 consistently or possibly a linear mapping.\n\n3. **Exploring \\( f(f(x)) \\) Relation:**\n   Using \\( f(yf(z)) = zf(y) \\) and setting \\( y = 1 \\):\n   \\[ f(f(z)) = zf(1) \\]\n   This implies \\( f \\) is potentially a linearly scaling function, and it could involve a scalar \\( c \\) where \\( f(x) = cx \\).\n\n### Analyzing Constant Forms\n\nGiven the potential implications from the substitutions and the constant nature observed, let's hypothesize if \\( f(x) = cx \\) fits well:\n\n- Plug in \\( f(x) = cx \\) into the original equation:\n  \\[ c(x^2 + cyz) = cx \\cdot cx + cz \\cdot cy \\]\n  \\[ cx^2 + c^2 yz = cx^2 + c yz \\]\n\nMatching both sides, we get:\n\\[ c^2 = c \\]\nSo, \\( c = 0 \\) or \\( c = 1 \\).\n\n### Conclusion and Correct Solution\n\nFrom our deductions, there are two distinct solutions:\n\n1. **\\( f(x) = 0 \\):** This is a trivial solution where \\( n = 1 \\).\n2. **\\( f(x) = x \\):** This maintains the integrity of the functional equation with \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nThus, there are indeed two solutions for \\( f(5) \\):\n- If \\( f(x) = 0 \\), then \\( f(5) = 0 \\).\n- If \\( f(x) = x \\), then \\( f(5) = 5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of possible values \\( n = 2 \\) and the sum of possible values \\( s = 0 + 5 = 5 \\). Finally, calculating \\( n \\times s \\):\n\\[ n \\times s = 2 \\times 5 = \\boxed{10} \\]\n\nThis re-evaluation reveals the interesting structure and alternate solutions that can exist in such functional equations, giving us the correct outcome.",
