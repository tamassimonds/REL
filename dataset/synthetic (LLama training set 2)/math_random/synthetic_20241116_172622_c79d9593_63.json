    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: Okay, the problem is asking how many minutes Gage needs to skate on the ninth day in order to average 85 minutes over all nine days. This involves calculating a total amount of skating time and then determining the necessary time on the ninth day.\n\n### Step 2: Break Down the Skating Times\n\nInitial approach: Let's figure out how much Gage skated on the first eight days.\n\n- **For the first 5 days**: He skated 1 hour and 15 minutes each day.\n  - Conversion of time: 1 hour = 60 minutes. Thus, 1 hour 15 minutes = 75 minutes.\n  - Total skating time for 5 days = 5 days \u00d7 75 minutes/day = 375 minutes.\n\n- **For the next 3 days**: He skated 1 hour and 30 minutes each day.\n  - Conversion of time: 1 hour 30 minutes = 90 minutes.\n  - Total skating time for 3 days = 3 days \u00d7 90 minutes/day = 270 minutes.\n\nChecking calculations: The conversions and multiplications seem correct. It's good to double-check since errors here would throw off the entire solution.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Skating Time Over 8 Days\n\nThought process: Let's add up the total minutes skated over the first eight days to make sure our calculations align with each other.\n\n- Total skating time for 8 days = 375 minutes (for 5 days) + 270 minutes (for 3 days) = 645 minutes.\n\nQuick check: Adding those correctly gives 645 minutes. It feels right.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Desired Average\n\nUnderstanding the 'average': To find out how many total minutes he needs for an average of 85 minutes over 9 days, let's calculate the total minutes required:\n\n- Total number of days = 9.\n- Desired total minutes for 9 days = 9 days \u00d7 85 minutes/day = 765 minutes.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Minutes Needed on the Ninth Day\n\nRealization: Now that we know how many minutes he needs in total (765), we can figure out how many more minutes are needed on the ninth day.\n\n- Total minutes needed on the ninth day = Desired total minutes (765) - Total minutes already skated (645) = 120 minutes.\n\nChecking this step: Does 120 minutes seem feasible? Yes, because adding 120 minutes to the already skated 645 minutes gives the desired total of 765 minutes. This confirms the calculations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFinal thoughts: To average 85 minutes over 9 days, Gage needs to skate 120 minutes on the ninth day. I feel confident in the steps taken and calculations made. The breakdown of time and conversion to minutes ensured the arithmetic was correct. The logic of finding the average also aligns with the approach.\n\nFeelings: This methodical approach helped clear the problem without missing any steps, despite initially feeling a bit complex with different stay days. No need to backtrack much as each part fits well into solving the overall problem.",

  "ground_truth": "In 5 days, Gage skated for $5 \\times 75 =375$ minutes, and in 3 days he skated for $3 \\times 90 = 270$ minutes.  So, in 8 days he skated for $375 + 270 = 645$ minutes.  To average 85 minutes per day for 9 days he must skate $9 \\times 85 = 765$ minutes, so he must skate $765-645=\\boxed{120}$ minutes = 2 hours the ninth day."
