    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and work through it step-by-step.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nFirst, let's clarify what the problem is asking: We are looking for the smallest integer \\( b > 3 \\) such that the number \\( 23_b \\) (which means the number \"23\" in base \\( b \\)) is a perfect square. \n\n**Expanding the Problem:**\n\nIn the base \\( b \\), the number \\( 23_b \\) translates to:\n\\[ 2b + 3 \\]\n\nWe want this number to be a perfect square. So we set:\n\\[ 2b + 3 = n^2 \\]\nFor some integer \\( n \\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer \\( b > 3 \\) that makes \\( 2b + 3 \\) a perfect square. Intuitively, I would start testing small numbers for \\( b \\) to see if any fit the criteria.\n\n**Strategy Brainstorming:**\n\n- We could try a brute force approach, where we substitute values of \\( b \\) manually and check if \\( 2b + 3 \\) gives a perfect square.\n- Alternatively, we could use algebra to rearrange the equation for easier inspection or iteration.\n\n**Let's start with the brute force method:**\n\nSince \\( b \\) must be greater than 3, let's try some values starting from 4:\n\n1. For \\( b = 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   2b + 3 = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11\n   \\]\n   \\( 11 \\) is not a perfect square.\n\n2. For \\( b = 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   2b + 3 = 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13\n   \\]\n   \\( 13 \\) is not a perfect square.\n\n3. For \\( b = 6 \\):\n   \\[\n   2b + 3 = 2(6) + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15\n   \\]\n   \\( 15 \\) is not a perfect square.\n\n4. For \\( b = 7 \\):\n   \\[\n   2b + 3 = 2(7) + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17\n   \\]\n   \\( 17 \\) is not a perfect square.\n\n5. For \\( b = 8 \\):\n   \\[\n   2b + 3 = 2(8) + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19\n   \\]\n   \\( 19 \\) is not a perfect square.\n\n6. For \\( b = 9 \\):\n   \\[\n   2b + 3 = 2(9) + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21\n   \\]\n   \\( 21 \\) is not a perfect square.\n\n7. For \\( b = 10 \\):\n   \\[\n   2b + 3 = 2(10) + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23\n   \\]\n   \\( 23 \\) is not a perfect square.\n\n8. For \\( b = 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   2b + 3 = 2(11) + 3 = 22 + 3 = 25\n   \\]\n   \\( 25 = 5^2 \\), which is a perfect square!\n\n**Reflections and Checks:**\n\nIt looks like \\( b = 11 \\) is the smallest base greater than 3 which makes \\( 2b + 3 \\) a perfect square because \\( 25 \\) is \\( 5^2 \\).\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nThe smallest integer \\( b > 3 \\) such that the base \\( b \\) number \\( 23_b \\) is a perfect square is \\( b = 11 \\).\n\nThis step-by-step brute force method has confirmed it, and no simplification or shortcuts were initially obvious. Next steps could involve looking for patterns or algebraic insights if a pattern existed, but in this case, brute force was straightforward and clear.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $23_b = 2b + 3$ and $b > 3$, $23_b$ can be any odd integer greater than $2(3) + 3 = 9$.  We are looking for the next smallest odd perfect square, which is $5^2 = 25$.  Since $2b + 3 = 25$, $b = \\boxed{11}$ is our answer."
