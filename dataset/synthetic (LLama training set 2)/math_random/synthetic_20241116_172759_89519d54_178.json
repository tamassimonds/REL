    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\n- Okay, we're dealing with a probability problem involving multiple coin flips.\n- I remember that each coin has two outcomes: heads or tails.\n- The problem is asking for the probability of both the penny and the nickel showing heads.\n- This makes me think about independent events since the flip of one coin does not affect the others.\n- I should determine a strategy to see if tackling the probability of individual coins first makes sense or if a different aggregate approach is better.\n\nExploring Strategies:\n\n- Should I calculate the probability for each coin separately and combine them?\n- How many possible outcomes are there when I flip all four coins at once?\n- Maybe consider the total number of outcomes where the penny and nickel are heads?\n- Is there a formula or previous problem solving experience I can leverage here?\n\nStep-by-step Approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Outcomes:** \n   - Each coin flip has 2 outcomes: heads or tails.\n   - For four coins (penny, nickel, dime, quarter), there are \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\\) total possible outcomes.\n\n2. **Focus on Specific Event - Penny and Nickel Both Heads:** \n   - The penny has a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of being heads.\n   - The nickel also has a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of being heads.\n   - Since these are independent events, the probability that both the penny and nickel are heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n3. **Consider the Dime and Quarter:** \n   - The problem doesn't specify outcomes for the dime and quarter, so they can be either heads or tails.\n   - This means there are \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) favorable ways the dime and quarter can fall in each of these when the penny and nickel are heads.\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability of the Desired Outcome:**\n   - We've established that there are 4 favorable combinations for dime and quarter, with a fixed combination of heads for penny and nickel.\n   - Aligning this with the \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) probability from earlier for the penny and nickel:\n   \\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 4 \\text{ desired outcomes} = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\n5. **Reflect and Double-check:** \n   - This makes intuitive sense given the number of outcomes and conditions set forth.\n   - The calculations and logic involve taking into account both specific outcomes and broader possibilities.\n   - The problem asked for the penny and nickel, specifically, so further constraints weren't needed.\n   - The answer really sums up nicely, and the reasoning checks out as all layers of coin outcomes are covered.\n\nThe probability that both the penny and the nickel come up heads in a simultaneous flip of these four coins is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails). There are 2 possibilities for the dime and 2 for the quarter, so there are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ successful outcomes, and the probability of this is $\\dfrac{4}{16} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}$."
