    "working_out": "### Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, let's break down this problem step-by-step. My first impression is that we need to somehow influence the sum of two randomly chosen integers from a list by removing one integer. This feels like a mix of combinatorics and strategic elimination.\n\n- **Goal**: Maximize the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen integers is 10.\n- **Plan**: Analyze which pairs of the numbers can form the sum 10, and then determine which number removal will increase the probability of selecting a remaining pair that adds up to 10.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Sum-10 Pairs\n\nBefore doing anything with probability, it's essential to identify which pairs of numbers from the list can sum to 10. Let's list all possible pairs:\n\n1. \\( -1+11 = 10 \\)\n2. \\( 0+10 = 10 \\)\n3. \\( 1+9 = 10 \\)\n4. \\( 2+8 = 10 \\)\n5. \\( 3+7 = 10 \\)\n6. \\( 4+6 = 10 \\)\n\nThese are all the distinct pairs from the original list that sum to 10.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Pair Count\n\nThe list contains 13 numbers initially. If we don't remove any number, we can choose 2 numbers in \\(\\binom{13}{2} = 78\\) ways.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Impact of Each Removal\n\nFor maximizing the number of sum-10 pairs after a removal, calculate how removing each number affects the possible pairs:\n\n- **Remove -1**: It breaks the pair (-1, 11), resulting in 5 remaining pairs.\n- **Remove 0**: It breaks the pair (0, 10), resulting in 5 remaining pairs.\n- **Remove 1**: It breaks the pair (1, 9), resulting in 5 remaining pairs.\n- **Remove 2**: It breaks the pair (2, 8), resulting in 5 remaining pairs.\n- **Remove 3**: It breaks the pair (3, 7), resulting in 5 remaining pairs.\n- **Remove 4**: It breaks the pair (4, 6), resulting in 5 remaining pairs.\n- **Remove 5**: Does not break any pair, resulting in 6 remaining pairs.\n- **Remove 6**: It breaks the pair (4, 6), resulting in 5 remaining pairs.\n- **Remove 7**: It breaks the pair (3, 7), resulting in 5 remaining pairs.\n- **Remove 8**: It breaks the pair (2, 8), resulting in 5 remaining pairs.\n- **Remove 9**: It breaks the pair (1, 9), resulting in 5 remaining pairs.\n- **Remove 10**: It breaks the pair (0, 10), resulting in 5 remaining pairs.\n- **Remove 11**: It breaks the pair (-1, 11), resulting in 5 remaining pairs.\n\nFrom this analysis, removing the number 5 maintains the maximum number of pairs that sum to 10, which is 6 pairs. \n\n### Step 4: Probability Calculation\n\nIf we remove 5, then 12 numbers remain. The number of ways to choose 2 numbers is \\(\\binom{12}{2} = 66\\).\n\nWith 6 pairs forming the sum 10, the probability is \\( \\frac{6}{66} = \\frac{1}{11} \\).\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Reflection\n\nReflect on the solution:\n- I've ensured maximum pairs contributing to the desired sum by strategic removal.\n- Removing 5 doesn't break any existing pair contributing to 10.\n- This strategy aligns with common sense where removing a number not in any sum-10 pair preserves more potential sum-10 pairs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number that should be removed to maximize the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen numbers is 10 is 5. The resultant probability is \\(\\frac{1}{11}\\). \n\nThis seems logical given the problem constraints and helps achieve the goal of maximizing the probability effectively. The approach involved both enumerating possible outcomes and strategically removing, which feels like a holistic method to tackle such a combinatorial problem.",

  "ground_truth": "For each integer $x$ in the list besides 5, the integer $10-x$ is also in the list.  So, for each of these integers, removing $x$ reduces the number of pairs of distinct integers whose sum is 10.  However, there is no other integer in list that can be added to 5 to give 10, so removing 5 from the list will not reduce the number of pairs of distinct integers whose sum is 10.\n\nSince removing any integer besides 5 will reduce the number of pairs that add to 10, while removing 5 will leave the number of pairs that add to 10 unchanged, we have the highest probability of having a sum of 10 when we remove $\\boxed{5}$."
