    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and explore different strategies together. The problem is about a company, BoatsRUs, which is building canoes over a series of months with each month's production being twice that of the previous month. We need to find out the total number of canoes built by the end of May.\n\n**First Impressions:**\n- This sounds like it involves a geometric progression since the multiplication factor between months is consistent (they build twice as many canoes each subsequent month).\n- Starting with 7 canoes and doubling each month seems manageable. I don't immediately see a trick, just straightforward multiplication and addition.\n\n### Strategy Exploration\n\n**1. Straightforward Calculation:**\n   - January: 7 canoes\n   - February: Twice the January number\n   - March: Twice the February number\n   - Continue this through May and sum them up\n  \nBut before just jumping to that, maybe there's something else I should consider...\n\n**2. Reflecting on a Formula:**\n   - Geometric sequence formula could help simplify calculations, but honestly, the series is short (only five months), so maybe just straightforward calculation is better here.\n   - The formula for the sum of a geometric series comes to mind: \\( S_n = a \\frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \\).\n   - Not 100% sure if it'll make things easier here given the small number of months.\n\n**3. Check Edge Cases:**\n   - Always good to see if I'm missing anything. Make sure there's nothing tricky about May or doubling logic.\n\n### Execution Plan\n\nOk, let's go forward with plausible straightforward calculations to find each month's production, and then sum them up. If calculations seem off, I can always backtrack and rethink or recheck.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1. **January:** \n   - BoatsBuilt = 7 (Given)\n2. **February:** \n   - BoatsBuilt = \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\)\n   - Let\u2019s pause: Yup, makes sense to double.\n3. **March:** \n   - BoatsBuilt = \\(14 \\times 2 = 28\\)\n   - Makes sense, simply continued doubling.\n4. **April:** \n   - BoatsBuilt = \\(28 \\times 2 = 56\\)\n   - Just going steadily so far; seems logical.\n5. **May:** \n   - BoatsBuilt = \\(56 \\times 2 = 112\\)\n\n**Summing Up:**\n\nCanoes built per month: 7 (Jan) + 14 (Feb) + 28 (Mar) + 56 (Apr) + 112 (May).\n\nLet\u2019s do the calculation:\n\\[ 7 + 14 + 28 + 56 + 112 = 217 \\]\n\n### Final Check\n\n- Quick cross-check: The doubling pattern held consistently.\n- Sum calculation seems reasonable.\n- Looking at the results independently for any number that stands out or seems improbable: Nothing seems odd.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy working through each month and checking my work, I'm confident that the total number of canoes built by the end of May is **217** canoes.\n\nIf anything feels off, revisiting the arithmetic or leveraging a geometric series formula could double-check results, but so far, this strategy seems error-free.",

  "ground_truth": "The numbers of canoes built by BoatsRUs each month form a geometric sequence: 7, 14, 28, 56, 112. The first term is 7 and the common ratio is 2, so the sum of these terms is $\\frac{7(2^5-1)}{2-1} = \\boxed{217}$."
