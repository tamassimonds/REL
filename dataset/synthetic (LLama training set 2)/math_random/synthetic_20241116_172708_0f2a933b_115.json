    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and really think it through step-by-step. The problem involves an equilateral triangle where its area is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. Our goal is to find the perimeter of the triangle.\n\n### First Thoughts\nHmm, when I read this, I immediately think about the formulas for the area and perimeter of an equilateral triangle. I know that the side length is denoted by \\( s \\). The perimeter is simply three times the side length, \\( 3s \\). The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\\).\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n- **Direct Calculation**: I could set the formula for the area equal to the side length because the problem says they are numerically equal. Then I would solve for \\( s \\) and calculate the perimeter.\n- **Special Cases or Patterns**: Sometimes numerical equality leads to simple numbers, like 1, or perfect square numbers, due to the way the formulas are structured.\n- **Approximation**: Not ideal here because we need an exact form, simplest radical form for the perimeter.\n  \n### Setting Up an Equation\nLet's start by setting the two expressions equal, since the problem states the area equals the side length. I\u2019m writing this down before solving anything to let it sink in:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n\\]\n\n### Solving Step-by-step\n1. **Rearranging**: I want to solve the equation above. \n   Multiply both sides by 4 to clear the fraction:\n   \\[\n   4s = \\sqrt{3} s^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplifying**: Now I need to isolate \\( s \\). If I divide both sides by \\( s \\) (assuming \\( s \\neq 0 \\)), I get:\n   \\[\n   4 = \\sqrt{3} s\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( s \\)**: Divide both sides by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) to isolate \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rationalizing**: It\u2019s usually good practice to rationalize the denominator:\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n   \\]\n\n### Checking Work\nI should check back with the original statement\u2014that the area equals the side length\u2014to ensure we\u2019re correct.\n\n- Calculate area with \\( s = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\left( \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times \\frac{48}{9} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} \\times 16}{12} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n  \\]\n- Looks good! Matches the side length.\n\n### Calculating Perimeter\nFinally, back to the main task\u2014to find the perimeter. Multiply \\( s \\) by 3:\n\\[\nP = 3s = 3 \\times \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n### Final Check\nThis seems reasonable. I followed through the logic and calculations step-by-step, and everything checks out when I go back to the original equation. This kind of approach helps ensure accuracy, especially with radical expressions. Wrapping it up:\n\n- **Answer**: The perimeter is \\( 4\\sqrt{3} \\) units.\n\nMy brain feels satisfied with the steps and checks here; I think we covered all necessary angles!",

  "ground_truth": "The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$. This must equal $s$. Setting the two equal and solving, we get \\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\\\\n4s&=s^2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4 &= s\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4\\sqrt{3}&= 3s \\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} &=s\n\\end{align*} Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is $3s=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}} \\text{units}$."
