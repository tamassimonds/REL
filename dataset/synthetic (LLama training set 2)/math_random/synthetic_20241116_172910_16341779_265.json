    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're tasked with finding the sum of odd integers from 11 through 39, inclusive. Initially, this question might remind me of similar problems I've tackled before involving sequences. Now, let's brainstorm some strategies.\n\n**Brainstorming Approaches:**\n\n1. **List and Sum**: An obvious and straightforward way would be to list all the odd numbers between 11 and 39 and then simply add them up. This method is time-consuming but ensures accuracy.\n\n2. **Formula for Arithmetic Series**: I know there's a formula to sum an arithmetic series: \\( S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of terms, \\( a \\) is the first term, and \\( l \\) is the last term. Since odd numbers form an arithmetic series with a common difference of 2, this could work.\n\n3. **Pairing Method**: Another approach involves pairing numbers from start to end, as they form an arithmetic progression. This method might leverage symmetry in the number sequence.\n\nLet's see which of these strategies might be simplest and most effective. I'll start with the formula since it's less manual than listing and should be accurate.\n\n**Step-by-step Exploration:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Range**:\n   - Start with the smallest odd number, 11.\n   - End at the largest odd number, 39.\n   - Confirm that these numbers inclusive form the entire set I need.\n\n2. **List Odd Numbers in Range** (quick check):\n   - The numbers are: 11, 13, 15, ..., 37, 39.\n   - Confirming these are all odd and have a difference of 2 confirms an arithmetic sequence.\n\n3. **Count the Terms**:\n   - Sequence: 11, 13, 15, ..., 39.\n   - Determine number of terms: First \\(a = 11\\), Last \\(l = 39\\).\n   - I realize, instead of counting manually, I could use \\( n = \\frac{l - a}{d} + 1 \\), where \\(d\\) is the common difference (2 in this case).\n   - Calculating: \\( n = \\frac{39 - 11}{2} + 1 = 15 \\).\n   - Check: Yes, 15 terms make sense. I mentally run through the list, double-checking that 11 to 39, inclusive of 2-step jumps, works.\n\n4. **Apply the Arithmetic Series Formula**:\n   - Using \\( S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l) \\).\n   - Substitute the values: \\( S = \\frac{15}{2} \\times (11 + 39) \\).\n   - Calculate inside the parentheses: \\( 11 + 39 = 50 \\).\n   - Therefore: \\( S = \\frac{15}{2} \\times 50 = 375 \\).\n\n5. **Check the Work**:\n   - Quick check: \\( \\frac{15 \\times 50}{2} \\): Breaking this down, \\( 15 \\times 25 = 375 \\). The multiplication checks out.\n   - Reflect: All steps and arithmetic seem consistent with typical principles of summing a series.\n\nSo, the sum of the odd integers from 11 to 39, inclusive, is **375**. It aligns with all checks and makes logical sense given the arithmetic series approach.",

  "ground_truth": "We want to sum the arithmetic series $11 + 13 + \\cdots + 39$, which has common difference 2. Suppose the series has $n$ terms. 39 is the $n$th term, so $39 = 11 + (n-1)\\cdot2$. Solving, we get $n = 15$.The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(11 + 39)/2 \\cdot 15 = \\boxed{375}$."
