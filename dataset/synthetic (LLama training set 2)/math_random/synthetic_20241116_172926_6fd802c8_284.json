    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see how we can figure out the value of \\(xy\\) given the equations \\(x-y = 4\\) and \\(x^3-y^3 = 28\\).\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe have:\n1. \\(x - y = 4\\)\n2. \\(x^3 - y^3 = 28\\)\n\nThese are both typical problems involving differences of terms. The cube difference formula \\(x^3 - y^3 = (x-y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)\\) might come in handy here. Given that I already have an expression for \\(x - y\\), this formula seems like a promising start. Let's explore it.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorm\nInitially, I see a connection to the cubic identities. I could try to express everything in terms of \\(x-y\\) and maybe substitute it into the known formulas, or try to express \\(xy\\) somehow directly from these identities.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Use the identity for the difference of cubes: \\(x^3 - y^3\\).\n2. Substitute the given \\(x-y=4\\) into this identity.\n3. Simplify to find \\(xy\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Use Cubic Identity:**\n    \\[\n    x^3 - y^3 = (x-y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)\n    \\]\n\n2. **Substitute \\(x-y = 4\\):**\n    \\[\n    x^3 - y^3 = 4(x^2 + xy + y^2)\n    \\]\n\n3. **Given: \\(x^3 - y^3 = 28\\):**\n    \\[\n    28 = 4(x^2 + xy + y^2)\n    \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x^2 + xy + y^2\\):**\n   Divide both sides by 4:\n    \\[\n    x^2 + xy + y^2 = 7\n    \\]\n\n5. **Express in terms of known identity:**\n   We know:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = (x-y)^2 + 2xy = 16 + 2xy\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   x^2 + xy + y^2 = (16 + 2xy) + xy = 16 + 3xy\n   \\]\n\n6. **Substitute back to find \\(xy\\):**\n    \\[\n    16 + 3xy = 7\n    \\]\n   Subtract 16 from both sides:\n    \\[\n    3xy = 7 - 16 = -9\n    \\]\n\n7. **Solve for \\(xy\\):**\n    \\[\n    xy = \\frac{-9}{3} = -3\n    \\]\n\n### Quick Check\nReflecting on the solution, these steps are consistent with the given identities and provided information. I used known algebraic identities and simplified without any assumptions or drastic steps. This feels correct, so I will mark this as the solution.\n\nThus, the value of \\(xy\\) is \\(\\boxed{-3}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Solution 1. The first equation gives $x = y+4$. Substituting into the second equation, we get \\[(y+4)^3 - y^3 = 28 \\implies 12y^2 + 48y + 36 = 0.\\]Thus, $y^2 + 4y + 3 = 0$, so $(y+1)(y+3) = 0$. Therefore, either $y=-1$ and $x=y+4=3$, or $y=-3$ and $x=y+4=1$. Either way, $xy = \\boxed{-3}$.\n\nSolution 2. The second equation factors via difference of cubes, as \\[(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2) = 28.\\]Since $x-y=4$, we have $x^2+xy+y^2=\\frac{28}{4} =7$. Now, squaring the first equation, we get $x^2-2xy+y^2=16$. Thus, \\[3xy = (x^2+xy+y^2) - (x^2-2xy+y^2) = 7-16=-9,\\]so $xy = \\frac{-9}{3} = \\boxed{-3}$."
