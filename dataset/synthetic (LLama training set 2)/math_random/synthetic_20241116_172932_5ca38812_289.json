  "problem": "On the Saturday of a weekend softball tournament, Team A plays Team B and Team C plays Team D. Then on Sunday, the two Saturday winners play for first and second places while the two Saturday losers play for third and fourth places. There are no ties. One possible ranking of the team from first place to fourth place at the end of the tournament is the sequence ACBD. What is the total number of possible four-team ranking sequences at the end of the tournament?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, it seems like a fairly standard combinatorial problem. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Tournament\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** The tournament has two stages. On Saturday, there are two matches: Team A vs. Team B, and Team C vs. Team D. On Sunday, the winners of these matches play each other for first and second place, and the losers play each other for third and fourth place. This creates a ranking order of all four teams by the end of the tournament.\n\n### Step 2: Consider Possible Outcomes for Saturday\n\n- **Thought:** On Saturday, each match has two potential outcomes (either team can win). This means there are \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) possible combinations of winners and losers.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Possible Outcomes for Sunday\n\n- **Thought:** For each outcome from Saturday:\n  - The two winners (let's call them W1 and W2) play for first and second place. There are 2 possible outcomes: W1 could win, or W2 could win.\n  - The two losers (L1 and L2) play for third and fourth place. Similarly, there are 2 possible outcomes: L1 could win, or L2 could win.\n\n- **Total possibilities for Sunday:** For each of the 4 Saturday outcomes, there are \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) possible outcomes on Sunday, resulting in a total of \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) possible tournament rankings.\n\n### Step 4: Determine All Four-Team Ranking Sequences\n\n- **Thought:** To visualize this, consider a scenario:\n  - If Team A wins against Team B, and Team C wins against Team D on Saturday, there are four possible orders on Sunday (ACBD, ACDB, CABD, CADB).\n  - Similarly, consider all Saturday outcomes and resulting Sunday possibilities:\n    1. A beats B, C beats D\n    2. A beats B, D beats C\n    3. B beats A, C beats D\n    4. B beats A, D beats C\n\n- For each of these Saturday pairings, we have the 4 different Sunday results, as described above.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Calculations\n\n- **Reflect:** The computations seem to hold because each stage of the tournament independently provides two binary decisions (match results), and each overall tournament outcome depends on the specific sequence of those decisions.\n\n- **Insight:** I might manage a simple edge case to intuitively verify this: the problem states that ACBD is one valid outcome; I can break down how the matches might proceed to yield ACBD:\n  1. Saturday: A beats B, C beats D.\n  2. Sunday: A beats C (1st), C beats B (2nd), B beats D (3rd), D loses (4th).\n\n- **Aha Moment:** This gives the ACBD order and matches our understanding of the possible outcomes.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\n- **Final Reflection:** Everything seems consistent. Considering both Saturday and Sunday matches lead to 16 unique outcomes.\n\n- **Final Answer:** There are 16 possible ranking sequences for the teams by the end of the tournament.\n\nThis problem required breaking down the sequence of events systematically, ensuring I accounted for every possibility on each day of play. This approach indicates a correct visualization of the format, ensuring all potential rankings are considered.",

  "ground_truth": "Looking at the ranking sequence, we see that A and B cannot both win on Saturday, and so neither AB nor BA can be the first and second places. Similarly, CD and DC cannot be the third and fourth places. Thus, the first and second place may be (A or B) and (C or D) or vice versa. This makes 2 (for the order) $\\times 2\\times 2 = 8$ possibilities for the first and second places. Then the third and fourth places can be two possible arrangements of the losers. In total, this is $8\\times 2 = \\boxed{16}$ arrangements."
