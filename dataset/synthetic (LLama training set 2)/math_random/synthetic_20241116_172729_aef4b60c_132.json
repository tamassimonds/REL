    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n**First Impressions:**\n\nOkay, so we have four points in a three-dimensional space: \\(A = (8,0,0)\\), \\(B = (0,-4,0)\\), \\(C = (0,0,6)\\), and \\(D = (0,0,0)\\). The goal is to find a point \\(P = (x, y, z)\\) such that each distance from \\(P\\) to these points is equal.\n\nThis feels like a classic problem of finding a point equidistant from several known points, which might mean we're dealing with some symmetry or it could be the center of some geometric object like a sphere. \nRight away, considering these are four points, it sounds like P might be some centroid or center. \n\n**Strategy Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Analytical Geometry**:\n   - Use distance formulas to set up equations.\n   - Since \\(AP = BP = CP = DP\\), the distance from \\(P\\) to each point must be equal. Use that to form equations and solve.\n\n2. **Symmetrical Consideration**:\n   - All points are on the axes, which might suggest symmetry around the origin or a similar point.\n   - Finding symmetry could reduce complexity.\n\n**Let's Try Analytical Geometry First:**\n\nTo have \\(AP = BP = CP = DP\\), the formula for the distance between two points in 3D space applies:\n\n\\[ AP = \\sqrt{(x-8)^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\]\n\\[ BP = \\sqrt{x^2 + (y+4)^2 + z^2} \\]\n\\[ CP = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-6)^2} \\]\n\\[ DP = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\]\n\nGiven \\(AP = BP\\), let's equate and simplify:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x-8)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + (y+4)^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides to get rid of the square roots:\n\n\\[\n(x-8)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + (y+4)^2 + z^2\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 16x + 64 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 8y + 16 + z^2\n\\]\n\nCancel out similar terms:\n\n\\[\n-16x + 64 = 8y + 16\n\\]\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n\\[\n-16x = 8y - 48\n\\]\n\nDivide by 8:\n\n\\[\n-2x = y - 6\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[ y = -2x + 6 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)} \\]\n\n**Repeat for \\(BP = CP\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (y+4)^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides again:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + 8y + 16 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 12z + 36\n\\]\n\nSimplify and solve:\n\n\\[\n8y + 16 = -12z + 36\n\\]\n\nBring it together:\n\n\\[\n8y = -12z + 20\n\\]\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n\\[\n2y = -3z + 5 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)} \n\\]\n\n**Finally, set \\(CP = DP\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-6)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\n\\]\n\nSquare again:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 12z + 36 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\n\\]\n\nCancel common terms:\n\n\\[\n-12z + 36 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(z\\):\n\n\\[ z = 3 \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)} \\]\n\n**Substitute Back:**\n\nNow, with \\(z = 3\\), let\u2019s substitute back into Equations 1 and 2. First:\n\n\\[ y = -2x + 6 \\]\n\nPlug into:\n\n\\[ 2y = -3z + 5 \\]\n\nGetting:\n\n\\[ 2(-2x + 6) = -3(3) + 5 \\]\n\n\\[ -4x + 12 = -9 + 5 \\]\n\n\\[ -4x + 12 = -4 \\]\n\n\\[ -4x = -16 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 4 \\]\n\nPlugging back for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[ y = -2(4) + 6 = -8 + 6 = -2 \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThus, the point \\(P\\) that satisfies the condition \\(AP = BP = CP = DP\\) is \\(P = (4, -2, 3)\\).\n\nLet\u2019s do a quick sanity check: substitute \\(P\\) back into the distance equations to verify equality. Each side should consistently yield equal distances back to \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) given our transformations, confirming our derived value. Yep! Looks good.",
