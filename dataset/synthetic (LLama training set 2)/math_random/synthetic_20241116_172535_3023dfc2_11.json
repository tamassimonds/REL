    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\nAlright, so I'm given this quadratic expression \\(5x^2 + 21x + v\\) and asked to find the value of \\(v\\) such that \\(\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10}\\) is a root. This looks somewhat familiar, kind of like finding a parameter in a polynomial when one of the roots or parts of it is known. But wait, it\u2019s just one root so maybe symmetry or something might help? No, wait. Having one root only gives me part of the quadratic story... Oh! There's a pattern here involving quadratic roots\u2014maybe symmetrical roots or something... But let me go step-by-step instead of jumping around too much.\n\nExploring Potential Strategies:\n\n1. **Use the Root Directly**: Substituting \\(\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10}\\) into the equation \\(5x^2 + 21x + v = 0\\) and solving for \\(v\\).\n\n2. **Considering Vieta's Formulas**: Once I have one root, maybe the sum/product of the roots could help. The sum should be \\(-\\frac{b}{a} = -\\frac{21}{5}\\), and the product is \\(\\frac{v}{5}\\). \n\n3. **Checking Discriminant Relation**: Investigating if I need or can use any properties of discriminants (especially since the root has a square root itself).\n\nAll these paths sound plausible, but using the root directly seems a straightforward start, given the complexity in the expression, I'd use Vieta\u2019s only after confirming the necessity. \n\nAssign a Direct Strategy:\n\nI\u2019ll start by verifying if substitution directly gives insight. My goal with substitution is to ensure \\(\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10}\\) satisfies the quadratic, and this involves:\n\n- Plugging \\(\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10}\\) directly into the given polynomial.\n- Solving for \\(v\\).\n\nStep-by-step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Substitute into the Quadratic**:\n   Substitute \\(x = \\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10}\\) and evaluate:\n   \\[\n   5\\left(\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10}\\right)^2 + 21\\left(\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10}\\right) + v = 0\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplify \\(\\left(\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10}\\right)^2\\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 = \\left(\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(-21-\\sqrt{301})^2}{100}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{441 + 2(-21)(-\\sqrt{301}) + 301}{100} = \\frac{742 + 42\\sqrt{301}}{100}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate each Term**:\n   - First term: \\(5x^2 = \\frac{5(742 + 42\\sqrt{301})}{100} = \\frac{3710 + 210\\sqrt{301}}{100}\\)\n   - Second term: \\(21 \\times \\frac{-21-\\sqrt{301}}{10} = \\frac{-441 - 21\\sqrt{301}}{10} = \\frac{-4410 - 210\\sqrt{301}}{100}\\)\n\n3. **Combine and Solve for \\(v\\)**:\n   Setting the evaluated expression equal to 0:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3710 + 210\\sqrt{301}}{100} + \\frac{-4410 - 210\\sqrt{301}}{100} + v = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplify to find \\(v\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-700}{100} + v = 0 \\implies v = \\frac{700}{100} \\implies v = 7\n   \\]\n\nChecking Work:\n\nLet\u2019s see: The work looks steady so far.\n\n- Going back, re-check each step confirms arithmetic\u2014every distribution aligns, square manipulation is good. The term simplification requires patience, I might've tripped up but breaking it down as tiny parts helps.\n- Root direction seems correct: substituting gave a linear solution path.\n\nConclusion reflects the derivation of the quadratic components as correct, confirming:\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\] \n\nFinal thoughts: Each reassessment reconfirmed the algebra remained consistent across derivation steps, giving confidence in \\(v = 7\\) as a solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We could substitute $(-21-\\sqrt{301})/10$ for $x$ in the equation, but the quadratic formula suggests a quicker approach. Substituting $5$, $21$, and $v$ into the quadratic formula gives  \\[\n\\frac{-(21)\\pm\\sqrt{(21)^2-4(5)(v)}}{2(5)}= \\frac{-21\\pm\\sqrt{441-20v}}{10}.\n\\]Setting $(-21+\\sqrt{441-20v})/10$ and $(-21-\\sqrt{441-20v})/10$ equal to $(-21-\\sqrt{301})/10$, we find no solution in the first case and $441-20v=301$ in the second case.  Solving yields $v=(301-441)/(-20)=(-140)/(-20)=\\boxed{7}$."
