    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\n- The problem states we have a hexagon with two distinct side lengths: 5 units and 6 units. We know the perimeter is 34 units. At first glance, the sum of the sides must equal 34. We start with $AB = 5$ and $BC = 6$. \n- I should try to find how many sides are 6 units by considering how sides totaling 34 may be arranged using the two lengths.\n- Intuitively, it feels like a balancing act between two numbers, possibly requiring some arithmetic juggling.\n\nExploration:\n\n1. Let's define variables:\n   - Number of sides measuring 5 units: \\( n_5 \\)\n   - Number of sides measuring 6 units: \\( n_6 \\)\n\n   We know:\n   - \\( n_5 + n_6 = 6 \\)  (since there are 6 sides)\n   - \\( 5n_5 + 6n_6 = 34 \\)  (to satisfy the perimeter condition)\n\n2. Strategy brainstorming:\n   - Solve the equation simultaneously.\n   - Try simple substitution or elimination to find the possible combinations of \\( n_5 \\) and \\( n_6 \\).\n\nAttempt Solving:\n\n- From \\( n_5 + n_6 = 6 \\), we can express \\( n_5 \\) as \\( n_5 = 6 - n_6 \\).\n- Substitute into the perimeter equation:\n\n\\[ \n5(6 - n_6) + 6n_6 = 34 \n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n30 - 5n_6 + 6n_6 = 34 \n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n30 + n_6 = 34 \n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( n_6 \\):\n\n\\[\nn_6 = 34 - 30 = 4\n\\]\n\nVerification Steps:\n\n- Quick check: \\( n_5 = 6 - n_6 = 6 - 4 = 2 \\).\n- So, we have two sides of 5 units and four sides of 6 units.\n- Check perimeter: \\( 5 \\times 2 + 6 \\times 4 = 10 + 24 = 34 \\). It fits!\n\nReflection:\n\nIt seems correct since the arithmetic balances out and satisfies all conditions. The sides arrangement is logical given the requirements set by the side lengths and the total perimeter. \n\nFinal Answer:\n\n- There are **four** sides of hexagon \\( ABCDEF \\) that measure 6 units.",

  "ground_truth": "If all sides measured $6$ units, the total perimeter would be $36$.  But this is $2$ too many units, so we must change two of these sides to $5$ units.  Thus $\\boxed{4}$ sides measure $6$ units."
