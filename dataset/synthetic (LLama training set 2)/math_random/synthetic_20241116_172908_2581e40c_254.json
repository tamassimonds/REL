    "working_out": "Alright, let's break this down and see what approach I can take to solve this problem of finding the number of distinct prime factors of 56.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nHmm, prime factors. There was something I learned about breaking numbers down... Oh right, prime factorization! The goal is to express 56 as a product of prime numbers.\n\nBefore I dive into factorization, I should brainstorm ways to approach this:\n\n1. **Trial Division:** Start dividing 56 by the smallest prime, which is 2, and continue dividing until I reach a point where it no longer divides evenly. Then, move to the next prime number and repeat until I'm left with a prime number.\n\n2. **Using Divisibility Rules:** Consider divisibility to make my life easier. For instance, 56 is even, so it's divisible by 2. What about other divisibility rules?\n\n3. **Factor Tree:** Create a visual representation. I could break it into two factors and keep breaking non-prime factors until I have only prime numbers.\n\nI'm leaning towards the trial division because... well, it feels systematic and somewhat easy to track. But the factor tree approach could also help visualize, especially if I get stuck.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach (Trial Division):**\n\n1. **Try dividing by the smallest prime (2):** \n   - 56 \u00f7 2 = 28. It divides evenly! 2 must be a factor.\n   - Quick check: Is it still even? Yes, 28 is even.\n   \n2. **Continue with 2:**\n   - 28 \u00f7 2 = 14. Another even division.\n   - Check again: Is 14 even? Yes.\n\n3. **And again with 2:**\n   - 14 \u00f7 2 = 7. Still even.\n   - Wait! 7 is odd now. Time to switch primes since 2 isn\u2019t going to work any longer on 7.\n\n4. **Next smallest prime (3):**\n   - Is 7 divisible by 3? Hmm, 7 divided by 3 doesn't work. It's not an integer.\n\n5. **Next up is 5:**\n   - Does it divide by 5? Nope, 7 \u00f7 5 isn't an integer either.\n\n6. **Try 7 (It is 7 after all):**\n   - 7 \u00f7 7 = 1. Perfect! Finally, we've reached one. 7 must be prime.\n\nLet's list the primes: 2, 7.\n- Wait... let me double-check my work here...\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI have two numbers, 2 and 7. These are both prime. \n- 2 appeared three times, but I'm looking for distinct factors, not repeated ones.\n- The problem specifically asked about distinct factors, not the full prime factorization breakdown. So that checks out, right?\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter reflection, I can confidently say that 56 has two distinct prime factors, which are 2 and 7. I stuck to my trial division plan, and it seems to have worked. No dead ends this time. Everything clicks with this approach. Did this solve the problem as expected? Yes! Everything seems to match up.\n\n**Quick Thought:**\n\nLet's try a quick verification: \n- The full prime factorization is 2 x 2 x 2 x 7 = 8 x 7 = 56. \n- So, indeed, the distinct prime factors here are 2 and 7, confirming our answer of **2 distinct prime factors**.\n\nFeels good to have checked it. This makes sense, and I'm satisfied with the steps and conclusion.",
