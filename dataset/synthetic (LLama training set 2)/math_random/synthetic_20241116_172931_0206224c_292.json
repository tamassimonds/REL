    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and solve it step by step. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, I'm dealing with a formula here: \\( L = \\frac{25T^4}{H^2} \\). There's something comforting about formulas because they give a direct pathway to finding the solution, but I need to understand each part. The question gives specific values for \\(T\\) and \\(H\\): \\(T=4\\) and \\(H=8\\). So, first instinct is to substitute these values into the formula and see what I can find.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Formula**\n\nLooking at the formula, \\( L = \\frac{25T^4}{H^2} \\):\n- \\(L\\) is the crushing load.\n- \\(T\\) is likely a variable related to the pillar's material properties or dimensions.\n- \\(H\\) is another variable, perhaps relating to height or another dimensional aspect.\n- There's a power involved, specifically \\(T\\) to the fourth power and \\(H\\) squared. These exponents could drastically impact the final value, so I need to be meticulous with those calculations.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Strategy**\n\nSubstitution is the strategy here. Replace the given \\(T\\) and \\(H\\) values into the equation. This looks straightforward, but I need to ensure I don\u2019t make any arithmetic errors, especially with powers.\n\n**Step 3: Substituting the Values**\n\nLet's substitute \\(T = 4\\) and \\(H = 8\\) into the formula:\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{25 \\times 4^4}{8^2} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the powers:\n- \\(4^4 = 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 256\\)\n- \\(8^2 = 8 \\times 8 = 64\\)\n\nHmm, now that I think about it, I should quickly double-check these before moving on:\n- For \\(4^4\\), when I break it down: \n  - \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\)\n  - \\(16 \\times 4 = 64\\)\n  - \\(64 \\times 4 = 256\\)\n- For \\(8^2\\), that checks out correctly as \\(64\\).\n\n**Step 4: Plug Back into the Formula**\n\nInsert those calculated powers back into the formula:\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{25 \\times 256}{64} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the Calculation**\n\nBefore multiplying out \\(25 \\times 256\\), let's simplify the fraction if possible:\n- Calculate the fraction first: \\( \\frac{256}{64} = 4 \\) because 256 divided by 64 equals 4.\n\nThat simplifies our equation quite neatly to:\n\n\\[ L = 25 \\times 4 \\]\n\nLet's multiply those together:\n\n\\[ L = 100 \\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- Does \\( \\frac{256}{64} = 4 \\) appear reasonable? Yes, because \\(256 \\div 64 = 4\\).\n- Multiply \\(25 \\times 4 = 100\\): This checks out nicely.\n\nSo, after checking through my work, it seems all the calculations are correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe value of \\(L\\), which represents the crushing load, is \\(100\\). This feels reasonable given the operations involved and the context of the problem. Everything's consistent, and I haven't noticed any glaring errors. So, there we have it \u2013 \\(L = 100\\) is the final answer!",
