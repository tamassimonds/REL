    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem. I'm looking for the number of ordered triples \\((x, y, z)\\) of real numbers, given the equations \\(x + y = 2\\) and \\(xy - z^2 = 1\\).\n\n### Brainstorm:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equations**: \n   - The first equation \\(x + y = 2\\) is a linear equation in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n   - The second equation \\(xy - z^2 = 1\\) might remind me of something like a conic section, but since it involves products and squares, it feels a bit more complex.\n\n2. **Potential Strategies**:\n   - **Substitution**: Solve for one variable in terms of the others and substitute. This seems like a natural first approach for the linear equation.\n   - **Elimination**: Not applicable here since there are only two equations and three variables.\n   - **Geometric Interpretation**: Explore if the equation setup could have a geometric interpretation, especially since the constraint \\(x + y = 2\\) is a line.\n\n3. **Initial Thought-Path**: \n   - Start by using the linear equation to express one variable, say \\(y\\), in terms of \\(x\\).\n   - Substitute into the second equation to see what form we get.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Express \\(y\\) in Terms of \\(x\\)**:\n   - From \\(x + y = 2\\), we have \\(y = 2 - x\\).\n\n2. **Substitute into the Second Equation**:\n   - Now, substituting into \\(xy - z^2 = 1\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x(2 - x) - z^2 = 1 \\implies 2x - x^2 - z^2 = 1\n   \\]\n   - Rearrange:\n   \\[\n   z^2 = 2x - x^2 - 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Analysis of the Equation**:\n   - We need this quadratic expression \\(2x - x^2 - 1\\) to be non-negative for \\(z^2\\) to be real.\n   - This turns our problem into analyzing when the quadratic \\(2x - x^2 - 1 \\geq 0\\).\n\n4. **Find Values of \\(x\\) for Which \\(2x - x^2 - 1 \\geq 0\\)**:\n   - Rearrange the quadratic into standard form: \n   \\(-x^2 + 2x - 1\\).\n   - Solve \\(-x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0\\) to find critical points.\n   - A standard quadratic equation solution gives:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   - Applying, \\(a = -1, b = 2, c = -1\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 4}}{-2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 0}{-2} = 1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine Range for \\(x\\)**:\n   - The quadratic opens downwards (since \\(a = -1 < 0\\)), so \\(x = 1\\) is the vertex where maximum occurs, and solutions are valid for points yielding non-negative values at the vertex-based symmetry if any. \n   - The rational roots x can be tested for inequalities as the derivative \\(f'(x) gives 0 at x = 1\\) indicates rate change.\n   - Thus so x interval for non-negative value only \\(x = 1\\)\n\n6. **Values for \\(z\\)**:\n   - With \\(x = 1\\), we can check:\n   \\[\n   z^2 = 2(1) - (1)^2 - 1 = 0\n   \\]\n   This implies \\(z = 0\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe combination \\((x, y, z) = (1, 1, 0)\\) works. Revisiting other forms, which based on our constraint perimeter shows no other values check out.\n\nThe equation inherently supplies a unique real solution within the setup criteria, due to quadratic vertex and derivatives showing constraints verifiable.\n\nThe final answer is there is just **one** ordered triple \\((1, 1, 0)\\) that satisfies both equations.",

  "ground_truth": "Squaring the equation $x + y = 2,$ we get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 4.$  Also, $4xy - 4z^2 = 4,$ so\n\\[x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 4xy - 4z^2.\\]Then $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 + 4z^2 = 0,$ which we write as\n\\[(x - y)^2 + 4z^2 = 0.\\]For this equation to hold, we must have $x = y$ and $z = 0,$ and if $x = y,$ then $x = y = 1.$\n\nTherefore, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ solution, namely $(x,y,z) = (1,1,0).$"
