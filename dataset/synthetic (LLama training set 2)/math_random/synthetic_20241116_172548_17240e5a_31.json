    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem step by step. Our goal is to find the product of the values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the equation \\( |4x| + 3 = 35 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Equation\nWhen I see absolute values like \\( |4x| \\), I immediately think about the property that absolute value equations break down into cases: one where the inside expression is positive and one where it's negative.\n\nFirst, let's isolate the absolute value:\n\\[ |4x| + 3 = 35 \\]\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides to make it easier to handle:\n\\[ |4x| = 32 \\]\n\nNow, this is a standard absolute value scenario where we consider two possibilities: \\( 4x = 32 \\) and \\( 4x = -32 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Solve Each Case\n\n**Case 1:** \\( 4x = 32 \\)\n- Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:\n  \\[ x = \\frac{32}{4} = 8 \\]\n\n**Case 2:** \\( 4x = -32 \\)\n- Similarly, dividing both sides by 4, we get:\n  \\[ x = \\frac{-32}{4} = -8 \\]\n\nSo here, I've determined that the values of \\( x \\) are 8 and -8.\n\n### Step 3: Product of the Solutions\nThe question asks for the product of these \\( x \\) values. Let's compute it:\n\n- Multiply the solutions:\n  \\[ 8 \\times (-8) = -64 \\]\n\n### Check Solution\nLet's quickly verify this solution by substituting both values back into the original modified equation to ensure they satisfy it:\n\n- For \\( x = 8 \\):\n  \\[ |4 \\times 8| + 3 = |32| + 3 = 32 + 3 = 35 \\] \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- For \\( x = -8 \\):\n  \\[ |4 \\times -8| + 3 = | -32 | + 3 = 32 + 3 = 35 \\] \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth solutions satisfy the original equation, so our approach and computations are correct.\n\n### Final Reflection\nInitially, I might have been worried about dealing with absolute values or overcomplicating things. But breaking it down into cases made the problem more straightforward. This solidifies my approach for future similar problems. The final product of the solutions is \\(-64\\), and that feels correct based on our steps and verifications.",

  "ground_truth": "We begin by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, in order to isolate the absolute value. This gives us $|4x|=35-3=32$, which we can split into two separate cases: $4x=32$ and $4x=-32$. For the first case, solving for $x$ would give us $x=\\frac{32}{4}=8$. For the second case, we would get $x=-\\frac{32}{4}=-8$. Therefore, the two values of $x$ that satisfy the initial equation are $x=8$ and $x=-8$. Since the problem asks for the product of these values, our solution is $(8)(-8)=\\boxed{-64}$."
