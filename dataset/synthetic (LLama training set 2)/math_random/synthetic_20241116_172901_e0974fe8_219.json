    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem of finding lattice points on the hyperbola given by the equation \\(x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe key here is to find integer solutions to the equation \\(x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2\\). This is a classic example of finding lattice points on a hyperbola. \n\nInitially, I'm thinking that this problem sounds somewhat familiar. It resembles other conic sections problems, but here we deal with a hyperbola, focusing specifically on the difference of squares.\n\n### Step 2: Reformulate the Equation\nThe equation given is \\(x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2\\). This can be factored as:\n\\[\n(x-y)(x+y) = 2000^2\n\\]\n\nNow, we have a product of two integers equal to a perfect square. I'm remembering that factors of a perfect square can be paired systematically. \n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Factor Pairs\nThe factorization approach seems promising. Let's explore the fact that \\(2000^2\\) is a perfect square:\n\\[\n2000 = 2^4 \\times 5^3\n\\]\n\\[\n2000^2 = (2^4 \\times 5^3)^2 = 2^8 \\times 5^6\n\\]\n\nThe number of divisors of a number \\(n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\dots p_k^{a_k}\\) is \\((a_1+1)(a_2+1)\\dots(a_k+1)\\). Applying this here:\n\\[\n(8+1)(6+1) = 9 \\times 7 = 63\n\\]\n\nThis means \\(2000^2\\) has 63 divisors. However, these include both positive and negative divisors. Therefore, consider divisor pairs \\((x-y),(x+y)\\).\n\n### Step 4: Explore Possible Combinations\nFor each of the 63 divisor pairs, there are two scenarios: positive and negative pairs. Specifically, for each valid pair \\((d_1, d_2)\\), we have \\((d_1, d_2)\\) and \\((-d_1, -d_2)\\). Since the equation is symmetric with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), each positive pair \\(d, \\frac{2000^2}{d}\\) results in a unique \\((x, y)\\) pair. Same logic applies to negative pairs.\n\n### Step 5: Account for Symmetry\nWe calculate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) via:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{d + \\frac{2000^2}{d}}{2}, \\quad y = \\frac{\\frac{2000^2}{d} - d}{2}\n\\]\n\nBoth \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) need to be integers, which is ensured as both \\(d\\) and \\(\\frac{2000^2}{d}\\) play roles of subtractive/additive divisors. Interestingly, given the symmetric nature, each divisor results in unique \\((x, y)\\) and the converse produces \\((\\pm x, \\pm y)\\).\n\n### Verification\nDouble-check: Substituting for feasible solutions should yield integer pairs. The count naturally doubles if considering negative counterparts.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, every divisor yields 2 lattice points: the positive and negative combination, correctly executed across all divisors:\nThe solution is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 63 = 126 \\]\n\nThe correct number of integer lattice points on the hyperbola is \\(126\\). This calculation accounts for symmetry and repeating paths, ensuring each legitimate point is counted correctly.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculation for finding the number of lattice points on the hyperbola \\(x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2\\). Let's re-examine the problem and explore a more precise approach.\n\n### Re-examination of the Problem\n\nInitially, I found that \\(x^2 - y^2\\) translates to \\((x-y)(x+y) = 2000^2\\). I had computed the number of divisors of \\(2000^2\\) as 63 and concluded that the total number of lattice points on the hyperbola was \\(2 \\times 63 = 126\\), assuming each pair of divisors maps to unique lattice points. However, upon revisiting the problem, I realized this approach didn't thoroughly consider the congruence conditions necessary for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be integers.\n\n### Explore Different Strategies and Correct Calculation\n\n#### Step 1: Revisiting the Parity of Factors\n\nGiven \\((x-y)(x+y) = 2000^2\\), let's delve deeper into the parity analysis. Each of \\((x-y)\\) and \\((x+y)\\) must have the same parity. Considering both are even, rewrite:\n\\[\nx-y = 2a, \\quad x+y = 2b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (2a)(2b) = 2000^2\n\\]\n\\[\n4ab = 2000^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad ab = 2^6 \\times 5^6\n\\]\n\nThis modification ensures both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integer values that conform to the remaining factorization of \\(2^6 \\times 5^6\\).\n\n#### Step 2: Rethink the Number of Factor Pairs\n\nThe number of divisors of \\(2^6 \\times 5^6\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\n(6+1)(6+1) = 49\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Considering Both Positive and Negative Pairs\n\nFor each divisor pair \\((a, b)\\), both positive and negative solutions are possible for \\((x, y)\\) due to symmetry:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2b + 2a}{2} = a + b, \\quad y = \\frac{2b - 2a}{2} = b - a\n\\]\n\nThis realization results in twice as many lattice points:\n\\[\n2 \\times 49 = 98\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4: Final Reflection\n\nWith this corrected approach, I can confidently conclude that the total number of lattice points on the hyperbola is indeed \\(98\\). The meticulous analysis of factor parity and symmetry has yielded the correct result, validating the lattice count across different orientations of factorization.\n\nTherefore, the accurate number of lattice points on the hyperbola is \\(\\boxed{98}\\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculation for finding the number of lattice points on the hyperbola \\(x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2\\).

The number of divisors of \\(2^6 \\times 5^6\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\n(6+1)(6+1) = 49\n\\]\n\nThis accounts for both positive and negative combinations of factors, leading to unique \\((x, y)\\) pairs.\n\n#### Step 3: Considering Both Positive and Negative Pairs\n\nFor each divisor pair \\((a, b)\\), both positive and negative solutions are possible for \\((x, y)\\) due to symmetry:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2b + 2a}{2} = a + b, \\quad y = \\frac{2b - 2a}{2} = b - a\n\\]\n\nThis realization results in twice as many lattice points due to symmetry considerations:\n\\[\n2 \\times 49 = 98\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4: Final Reflection\n\nWith this corrected approach, I can confidently conclude that the total number of lattice points on the hyperbola is indeed \\(98\\).

This exploration confirms that each divisor pair gives rise to a valid lattice point, confirming the symmetry and correctness of the approach.",
