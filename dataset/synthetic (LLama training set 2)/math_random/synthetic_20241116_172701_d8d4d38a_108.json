    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step and explore various approaches we could take.\n\n**First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, this problem involves dividing two numbers, `a` and `b`, by other numbers and dealing with remainders. Then, we have to find what happens when we add these two results and divide by 15. This feels like a problem related to modular arithmetic. Modular arithmetic often appears in problems involving remainders.\n\n- The problem states that when `a` is divided by 45, the remainder is 37, which suggests that `a = 45k + 37` for some integer `k`.\n- Similarly, `b` divided by 30 gives a remainder of 9, meaning `b = 30m + 9` for some integer `m`.\n\n**Brainstorming**\n\nNow we need to figure out `a + b` modulo 15. Let's see how we can represent `a + b` in relation to 15:\n\n1. Start with the expressions derived from divisors:\n   - `a = 45k + 37`\n   - `b = 30m + 9`\n\n2. Therefore, \n   \\[\n   a + b = (45k + 37) + (30m + 9) = 45k + 30m + 46\n   \\]\n\n**Thinking with Modulo 15**\n\nNow, we want to reduce this modulo 15 to find the remainder when `a + b` is divided by 15:\n\n3. Check how each term behaves modulo 15:\n   - Notice: `45k mod 15` is 0 because 45 is a multiple of 15.\n   - Similarly, `30m mod 15` is also 0 because 30 is a multiple of 15.\n   \n4. Therefore:\n   - \\[\n   a + b \\equiv 46 \\mod 15\n   \\]\n\n5. Now, reduce 46 modulo 15:\n   - Compute \\(46 \\div 15 \\approx 3.066\\), which means 15 goes into 46 three times completely, i.e., \\(15 \\times 3 = 45\\).\n   - So, \\(46 - 45 = 1\\).\n\nHence, \\(46 \\mod 15 = 1\\).\n\n**Reflection**\n\nLet's think back to the checks we performed:\n- We used properties of modular arithmetic and our expressions for `a` and `b` involving division and remainders.\n- Converted everything with respect to modulo 15 and ensured the additions were correct.\n- Double checking the calculation \\(46 - 45 = 1\\) ensured the arithmetic was on point.\n\n**Conclude**\n\nThe remainder when \\(a + b\\) is divided by 15 is indeed **1**. This is consistent with all steps logically checking out. Reflecting on this, everything seems to fall in line correctly. The approach using modular arithmetic worked seamlessly.\n\nAnd there it is!",
