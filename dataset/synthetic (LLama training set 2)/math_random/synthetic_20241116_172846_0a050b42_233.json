    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem by considering various approaches and reflecting on each step as we move forward.\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nWhen I first look at this problem, it reminds me of triangle configurations and relationships between sides. I see that we have two triangles, \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and \\(\\triangle DBC\\), which share a side, \\(BC\\). The problem requires finding the least possible integral length of \\(BC\\).\n\n**Known Information:**\n- Triangle \\(\\triangle ABC\\) has sides: \\(AB = 5\\ \\text{cm}\\), \\(AC = 12\\ \\text{cm}\\).\n- Triangle \\(\\triangle DBC\\) has sides: \\(DC = 8\\ \\text{cm}\\), \\(BD = 20\\ \\text{cm}\\).\n- Both triangles share side \\(BC\\).\n\n**Strategy Brainstorm:**\n1. Use triangle inequality:\n   - For \\(\\triangle ABC\\), \\(AB + BC > AC\\), \\(AB + AC > BC\\), \\(AC + BC > AB\\).\n   - For \\(\\triangle DBC\\), \\(BD + DC > BC\\), \\(BD + BC > DC\\), \\(DC + BC > BD\\).\n2. Calculate the minimal length of \\(BC\\) such that both triangles satisfy these inequalities.\n3. Consider potential overlaps and intersecting triangles.\n\n**Approaching Trial with Triangle Inequality:**\n\n1. **For \\(\\triangle ABC\\):**\n   - \\(AB + BC > AC \\implies 5 + BC > 12 \\implies BC > 7\\)\n   - \\(AB + AC > BC \\implies 5 + 12 > BC \\implies BC < 17\\)\n   - \\(AC + BC > AB \\implies 12 + BC > 5\\), which is always true as \\(BC > 0\\).\n\n2. **For \\(\\triangle DBC\\):**\n   - \\(BD + DC > BC \\implies 20 + 8 > BC \\implies BC < 28\\)\n   - \\(BD + BC > DC \\implies 20 + BC > 8 \\implies BC > -12\\), always true\n   - \\(DC + BC > BD \\implies 8 + BC > 20 \\implies BC > 12\\)\n\n**Combining Inequalities:**\n\nFrom triangle \\(\\triangle ABC\\): \\(7 < BC < 17\\)  \nFrom triangle \\(\\triangle DBC\\): \\(12 < BC < 28\\)  \n\nCombining these gives: \\(12 < BC < 17\\)\n\n**Considering Integer Values:**  \nThe potential integer values for \\(BC\\) in that range are: 13, 14, 15, 16.\n\nNow, let's check whether each possible \\(BC\\) satisfies both triangles' inequalities.\n\n1. **For \\(BC = 13\\):**\n   - \\(\\triangle ABC: \\ 5 + 13 > 12, \\ 5 + 12 > 13, \\ 12 + 13 > 5\\) (All satisfied)\n   - \\(\\triangle DBC: \\ 20 + 8 > 13, \\ 20 + 13 > 8, \\ 8 + 13 > 20\\) (All satisfied)\n\nSince \\(BC = 13\\) satisfies all the triangle inequalities, we've confirmed the least possible integral length for \\(BC\\) is 13. This makes logical sense and aligns with basic geometric principles, confirming our approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe least possible integral number of centimeters in \\(BC\\) is 13.",

  "ground_truth": "By the triangle inequality on triangle $ABC$, $BC > AC - AB = 12 - 5 = 7$, and by the triangle inequality on triangle $BCD$, $BC > BD - CD = 20 - 8 = 12$.  Hence, $BC$ must be at least $\\boxed{13}$ centimeters.  (And it is easy to verify that it is possible for $BC$ to be 13 centimeters."
