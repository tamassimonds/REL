    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, as if we're thinking through it in real-time. Here we go.\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: Okay, I'm dealing with two numbers in different bases: 249 in base 11 and 3AB in base 12. I need to convert each of these numbers to a base 10 integer and then add them together. I'm a bit anxious about the letters A and B, as they represent digits in base 12 that are equivalent to 10 and 11 respectively in base 10. But this looks like a problem in base conversion, which reminds me of when I converted binary to decimal. Let's give it a shot.\n\n#### Step 2: Convert \\(249_{11}\\) to Base 10\n\nHmm, here's how I handle this. Each digit represents a power of 11 (since it's base 11). I'll decompose 249 as:\n\n- The '2' is in the hundreds place, so it's \\(2 \\times 11^2\\).\n- The '4' is in the tens place, so it's \\(4 \\times 11^1\\).\n- The '9' is in the units place, so it's \\(9 \\times 11^0\\).\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 11^2 = 2 \\times 121 = 242 \\]\n\\[ 4 \\times 11^1 = 4 \\times 11 = 44 \\]\n\\[ 9 \\times 11^0 = 9 \\times 1 = 9 \\]\n\nAdding these numbers:\n\n\\[ 242 + 44 + 9 = 295 \\]\n\nAlright, that seems reasonable. Quick check: \\( 2 \\times 121 = 242\\), yes; \\(4 \\times 11 = 44\\), affirming; and \\(9 = 9\\). The result is 295. Nice!\n\n#### Step 3: Convert \\(3AB_{12}\\) to Base 10\n\nOkay, now for the 3AB part. I need to keep track of A being 10 and B being 11 (tricky, but not impossible).\n\n- '3' is in the hundreds place equivalent, so \\(3 \\times 12^2\\).\n- 'A' is in the tens place, which is 10 in base 10, so \\(10 \\times 12^1\\).\n- 'B' is in the units place, which is 11 in base 10, so \\(11 \\times 12^0\\).\n\nLet's calculate each:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 12^2 = 3 \\times 144 = 432 \\]\n\\[ 10 \\times 12^1 = 10 \\times 12 = 120 \\]\n\\[ 11 \\times 12^0 = 11 \\times 1 = 11 \\]\n\nNow, add these together:\n\n\\[ 432 + 120 + 11 = 563 \\]\n\nDo a quick double-check: \\(3 \\times 144 = 432\\), sure; \\(10 \\times 12 = 120\\), keeping strong; \\(11 = 11\\). So \\(3AB_{12}\\) converts to 563 in base 10. That feels right.\n\n#### Step 4: Adding the Two Converted Base 10 Numbers\n\nSo I have two numbers in base 10: 295 and 563. Now, I add them:\n\n\\[ 295 + 563 = 858 \\]\n\nA quick mental check: the units digit match, carries seem sensible, so this should be accurate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the base 10 representation of \\(249_{11} + 3AB_{12}\\) is 858. Everything checks out cleanly, and I didn't encounter any inconsistencies with the conversions. This approach seems solid. \n\nIf something seems off, I have a logical path to go back and verify each conversion again, but it seems like everything adds up correctly now.",

  "ground_truth": "We have that \\begin{align*} 249_{11} &= 2(11^2)+ 4(11^1) +9(11^0) \\\\\n&= 2(121)+4(11)+9(1)\\\\\n&= 242 + 44 + 9\\\\\n&= 295\\\\\n3AB_{12} &= 3(12^2)+ 10(12^1) +11(12^0) \\\\\n&= 3(144)+10(12)+11(1)\\\\\n&= 432 + 120 + 11\\\\\n&= 563\n\\end{align*}So, $249_{11}+3AB_{12}=295+563=\\boxed{858}$."
