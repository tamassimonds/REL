    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: compute \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{3n-1}{2^n}\\).\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n1. When first looking at this problem, my instinct is to recognize it as a series involving \\(\\frac{1}{2^n}\\), which is reminiscent of a geometric series. However, the presence of \\(3n - 1\\) complicates things a bit.\n2. This doesn't look like a standard geometric series because of the \\(n\\) in the numerator. It reminds me of some algebraic manipulation we're often required to do in series problems, such as separating or shifting series components.\n\nLet's begin breaking it down:\n\n### Step 1: Separation of Series\n- One approach might be to try separating the series into more manageable parts. Immediately, I'm seeing if we can split \\(\\frac{3n-1}{2^n}\\) into two separate series.\n- Let's think about rewriting it:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3n-1}{2^n} = \\frac{3n}{2^n} - \\frac{1}{2^n}\n  \\]\n- Ah! This splits the series into two parts that might be more manageable:\n  \\[\n  \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{3n}{2^n} - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Address Each Series Separately\n- The series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n}\\) is an easy geometric series with first term \\(a = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and common ratio \\(r = \\frac{1}{2}\\). The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is \\(S = \\frac{a}{1-r}\\).\n  \\[\n  \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1-\\frac{1}{2}} = 1\n  \\]\n\n- For the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{3n}{2^n}\\), this is slightly more tricky, but this reminds me of a standard result or trick involving power series and derivatives. \n  - Consider \\(S = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} x^n = \\frac{x}{1-x}\\) for \\(|x| < 1\\).\n  - Differentiate \\(S\\) w.r.t. \\(x\\): \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\\)\n  - Thus, \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n x^{n-1} = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\\), and multiplying by \\(x\\) gives: \n    \\[\n    \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n x^n = \\frac{x}{(1-x)^2}\n    \\]\n  - Set \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we are interested in \\(3 \\times\\) this:\n    \\[\n    \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = 2\n    \\]\n    Therefore,\n    \\[\n    \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{3n}{2^n} = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n    \\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Series\n- Now combine the results:\n  \\[\n  \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{3n-1}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{3n}{2^n} - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n} = 6 - 1 = 5\n  \\]\n\nAfter reflecting on each step and checking the calculations, this approach seems solid and aligns with the expected series properties. Therefore, the sum of the series is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
