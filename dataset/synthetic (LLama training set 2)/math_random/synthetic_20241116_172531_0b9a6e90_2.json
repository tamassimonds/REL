    "working_out": "Alright, time to tackle this problem. Let\u2019s dive in and think it through step by step.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem here involves comparing the running times of two people, Jordan and Steve, over different distances. Immediately, I know this has to do with rates or speed since we\u2019re comparing how far they run in different times.\n\nSteve\u2019s scenario is clearer because we know he runs 3 miles in 24 minutes. But Jordan\u2019s time is defined as half of Steve's time to run his 3 miles. From that, we need to figure out how long Jordan would take to run 5 miles. Sounds like something related to proportions or maybe unit rates.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Steve's Running Rate**\n\nFirst, I should calculate Steve\u2019s running speed. He runs 3 miles in 24 minutes. So, his rate in terms of miles per minute is:\n\\[ \\text{Steve's rate} = \\frac{3 \\text{ miles}}{24 \\text{ minutes}} \\]\n\nLet me do the math:\n\\[ \\text{Steve's rate} = \\frac{1}{8} \\text{ miles per minute} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Checking and Reflecting**\n\nDoes that make sense? Yes, 1/8 mile per minute seems reasonable. In 8 minutes, Steve covers a mile. That seems right given the numbers.\n\n**Step 3: Understanding Jordan's Running Time and Rate**\n\nNext, consider Jordan. It took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles. Since Jordan took half that time:\n\\[ \\text{Jordan's time for 2 miles} = 12 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nIt seems smart to establish Jordan\u2019s running rate now. Since he ran 2 miles in 12 minutes:\n\\[ \\text{Jordan's rate} = \\frac{2 \\text{ miles}}{12 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ miles per minute} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Verify Jordan\u2019s Rate**\n\nThis looks right: 1/6 miles per minute. If Jordan runs for 6 minutes, he covers 1 mile, consistent with running 2 miles in 12 minutes. Okay, I feel confident in this.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Time for 5 Miles for Jordan**\n\nNow, let's figure out how long it would take Jordan to run 5 miles with his rate. Using the rate:\n\\[\n\\text{Time for 5 miles} = \\frac{5 \\text{ miles}}{\\frac{1}{6} \\text{ miles per minute}} \n\\]\nCalculate that:\n\\[\n\\text{Time for 5 miles} = 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Final Reflection**\n\nLet me check if this result makes sense: Jordan runs at a speed of 1/6 mile per minute, meaning every 6 minutes he covers 1 mile. Over a 30-minute period, he would indeed cover 5 miles. This checks out given the running speeds question.\n\nThere it is: It would take Jordan 30 minutes to run 5 miles at the rate defined.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAlright, after walking through each step, my calculations and conclusions seem consistent with the problem's requirements. This method of breaking down each runner's rate and analyzing the problem component by component gives me confidence in the answer. Jordan takes 30 minutes to run 5 miles.",

  "ground_truth": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles."
