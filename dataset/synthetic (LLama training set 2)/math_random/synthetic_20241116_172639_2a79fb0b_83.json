    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this. We're tasked with finding the remainder of \\(19^{1999}\\) when divided by 25. \n\nFirst thoughts:\n- This looks like a problem where I'd use some kind of theorem involving modular arithmetic. Something like Fermat's Little Theorem or Euler's Theorem might be relevant because those deal with powers and modular arithmetic.\n- \\(19^{1999}\\) is a massive number, so I definitely don't want to compute it directly.\n- I remember something about powers and modulo being reduced under certain conditions, so maybe that's a good angle.\n\n**Step 1: Exploring Possible Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation with Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem:**\n   - Fermat's Little Theorem says if \\( p \\) is a prime and \\( a \\) is an integer not divisible by \\( p \\), then \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\).\n   - But 25 isn't a prime, so maybe Euler\u2019s Theorem (a generalization) is better:\n\n2. **Using Euler's Theorem:**\n   - Euler\u2019s Theorem states that if \\( a \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime, then \\( a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} \\), where \\(\\phi(n)\\) is Euler's totient function.\n   - I know \\(\\phi(25)\\), since 25 is \\(5^2\\), is \\( 25 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 20 \\).\n   - Therefore, if \\(19\\) and \\(25\\) are coprime, which they are, then \\(19^{20} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}\\).\n\n3. **Apply Euler's Theorem:**\n   - Since \\(19^{20} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}\\), I can express \\(19^{1999}\\) as \\(19^{1999} = (19^{20})^{99} \\times 19^{19}\\).\n   - We've established \\(19^{20} \\equiv 1\\), so \\((19^{20})^{99} \\equiv 1^{99} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}\\).\n   - So I really only need to calculate \\(19^{19} \\pmod{25}\\).\n\n4. **Simplifying \\(19^{19} \\pmod{25}\\):**\n   - \\(19 \\equiv -6 \\pmod{25}\\), so \\(19^{19} \\equiv (-6)^{19} \\pmod{25}\\).\n   - To simplify \\((-6)^{19}\\), work modulo 25, and remember we want to see if \\((-6)^{19} \\equiv x \\pmod{25}\\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Using Modular Arithmetic**\n\n1. **Break It Down Further:**\n   - Let's simplify power by using successive squares: compute \\((-6)^2, (-6)^4, \\ldots\\) modulo 25\n   - \\((-6)^2 = 36 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{25}\\)\n   - \\((-6)^4 = (11)^2 = 121 \\equiv 21 \\pmod{25}\\)\n   - \\((-6)^8 = 21^2 = 441 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{25}\\)\n   - \\((-6)^{16} = 16^2 = 256 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}\\)\n\n2. **Combine Steps:**\n   - Evaluate \\((-6)^{19} = (-6)^{16} \\times (-6)^3\\).\n   - From above, \\((-6)^{16} \\equiv 6\\).\n   - Calculate \\((-6)^3 = (-6) \\times (-6)^2 \\equiv -6 \\times 11 = -66 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}\\).\n\n3. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Combine: \\(-6^{19} \\equiv 6 \\times 9 = 54 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{25}\\).\n\n**Step 3: Checks and Balances:**\n\n- Double-check: calculate alternatively or reassess reasoning at stages.\n- Be wary of sign errors or arithmetic missteps; everything checks out here.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe remainder of \\(19^{1999}\\) when divided by 25 is \\( \\boxed{4} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let us investigate the first few powers of 19: \\begin{align*}\n19^1 &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^2 &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^3 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^4 &\\equiv 21 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^5 &\\equiv 24 \\pmod{25}.\n\\end{align*} At this point, we see that $19^5 \\equiv 24 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25},$ hence $19^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}.$ That means that $19^{1999} = 19^9 \\cdot (19^{10})^{199} \\equiv 19^9 \\pmod {25}.$\n\nSince $19^4 \\equiv 21 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{25}$ and $19^5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25},$ then $19^{1999} \\equiv 19^9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{25},$ hence our desired remainder is $\\boxed{4}.$"
