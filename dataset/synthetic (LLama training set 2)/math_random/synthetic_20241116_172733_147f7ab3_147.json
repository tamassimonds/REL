    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\n\nOkay, we have a series involving sine functions, specifically \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{35}\\sin 5k\\). We're given that this sum equals \\(\\tan \\frac{m}{n}\\) with certain conditions on \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). Our goal is to find \\(m+n\\).\n\nFirst impression: This looks like a trigonometric sum problem I've encountered before, involving angles increasing in some arithmetic progression. Often these involve simplifications or known formulas, possibly even complex numbers or some trigonometric identity.\n\n### Step 2: Explore Potential Strategies\n\n1. **Use known trigonometric identities**: Sums involving sines and cosines often have specific identities or formulas that can simplify them. \n\n2. **Consider the unit circle or complex numbers**: Sometimes these problems can be elegantly solved by treating the sines as imaginary parts of exponential functions.\n\n3. **Direct calculation**: I could start computing directly, though this seems inefficient without simplifying identities.\n\n### Step 3: Perform Preliminary Analysis\n\nI remember a formula for sums of sines that have evenly spaced arguments like this. The series \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\sin(a + kd)\\) often can be simplified using trigonometric sum identities.\n\nNow, these are sines of multiples of 5 degrees, \\(5k\\). The series is then \\(\\sin 5^\\circ, \\sin 10^\\circ, \\ldots, \\sin 175^\\circ\\).\n\n### Step 4: Using Identities\n\nThere's a formula for \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\sin xk\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\sin xk = \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{nx}{2}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{(n+1)x}{2}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nLet's apply this. Here, \\(x = 5^\\circ\\) and \\(n=35\\).\n\nCalculate:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{35} \\sin 5k = \\frac{\\sin\\left( \\frac{35 \\times 5}{2} \\right) \\sin\\left( \\frac{(35+1) \\times 5}{2} \\right)}{\\sin\\left( \\frac{5}{2} \\right)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying Further\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin(87.5^\\circ) \\sin(90^\\circ)}{\\sin(2.5^\\circ)}\n\\]\n\nWe know \\(\\sin(90^\\circ) = 1\\), so:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\sin(87.5^\\circ)}{\\sin(2.5^\\circ)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Evaluating \\(\\frac{\\sin(87.5^\\circ)}{\\sin(2.5^\\circ)}\\)\n\nFrom the identities, \\(\\sin(87.5^\\circ) = \\cos(2.5^\\circ)\\). Therefore, this becomes:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\cos(2.5^\\circ)}{\\sin(2.5^\\circ)}\n\\]\n\n\\(\\frac{\\cos(2.5^\\circ)}{\\sin(2.5^\\circ)} = \\cot(2.5^\\circ)\\), and \\(\\cot x = \\frac{1}{\\tan x}\\), so this equals \\(\\tan^{-1}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sin(2.5^\\circ)} \\right)\\).\n\nConvert to degrees:\n\\[\n= \\tan 87.5^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find \\(\\frac{m}{n} = 87.5\\). The fractions that simplify to 87.5 could be \\( \\frac{175}{2} \\).\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\n\nSince \\(\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{175}{2}\\) is already in the simplest form, the integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are \\(175\\) and \\(2\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum \\(m+n\\) is:\n\n\\[\nm+n = 175 + 2 = 177\n\\]\n\nThere we go! The answer is \\(177\\). Thank you for coming along this thought process with me.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $s = \\sum_{k=1}^{35}\\sin 5k  = \\sin 5 + \\sin 10 + \\ldots + \\sin 175$. We could try to manipulate this sum by wrapping the terms around (since the first half is equal to the second half), but it quickly becomes apparent that this way is difficult to pull off. Instead, we look to telescope the sum. Using the identity $\\sin a \\sin b = \\frac 12(\\cos (a-b) - \\cos (a+b))$, we can rewrite $s$ as\n\\begin{align*} s \\cdot \\sin 5 = \\sum_{k=1}^{35} \\sin 5k \\sin 5 &= \\sum_{k=1}^{35} \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos (5k - 5)- \\cos (5k + 5))\\\\ &= \\frac{0.5(\\cos 0 - \\cos 10 + \\cos 5 - \\cos 15 + \\cos 10 \\ldots + \\cos 165 - \\cos 175+ \\cos 170 - \\cos 180)}{\\sin 5}\\end{align*}\nThis telescopes to\\[s = \\frac{\\cos 0 + \\cos 5 - \\cos 175 - \\cos 180}{2 \\sin 5} = \\frac{1 + \\cos 5}{\\sin 5}.\\]Manipulating this to use the identity $\\tan x = \\frac{1 - \\cos 2x}{\\sin 2x}$, we get\\[s = \\frac{1 - \\cos 175}{\\sin 175} \\Longrightarrow s = \\tan \\frac{175}{2},\\]and our answer is $\\boxed{177}$."
