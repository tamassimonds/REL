    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle this problem just like I would if I were solving it myself, complete with brainstorming, exploring strategies, reflecting, and checking my work regularly. I'll write down my thought process step by step, so it feels natural and human-like.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's take a look at the question:\n\n- **Given Information:**\n  - **86.8%** of surveyed people thought rats carried diseases.\n  - Of those, **45.7%** believed rats frequently carried rabies.\n  - **21 people** were mistaken about rats frequently carrying rabies.\n\n- **Goal:**  \n  - Determine the **total number** of people John surveyed.\n\nHmm... Initial thoughts:\n\n- This seems like a **percentage problem** involving multiple layers of percent calculations.\n- It reminds me of problems where you deal with **conditional probabilities** or **nested percentages**.\n- I need to be careful with the order of operations\u2014calculating percentages step by step to avoid mistakes.\n- **Wait**, I notice that the percentage of people thinking rats frequently carry rabies is related to those who believe rats carry diseases. Maybe I can set up some equations or proportions.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Let me brainstorm a bit more.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Percentage of Total Surveyed:**\n   - I could start by determining how many people thought rats carried diseases overall.\n   \n2. **Breaking Down the 45.7%:**\n   - Then, from that group, find out how many believe rats frequently carry rabies.\n   \n3. **Using the Mistaken 21 People:**\n   - Since 21 people are mistakenly thinking rats frequently carry rabies, I can use that to backtrack and find the total number surveyed.\n\nHmm... This approach makes sense because we can use the known quantity (21 mistaken people) to find the total. But let me think\u2014**is there a risk of circular calculations here?**\n\nI think it's worth trying this method and seeing if it leads to a coherent total. If it doesn't work, I can explore alternatives.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Proportion of Mistaken People**\n\nGiven that **45.7%** of the people who thought rats carried diseases also believed in frequent rabies, and **21 people** were mistaken about this, I can set up a proportion.\n\n- **Wait**, before proceeding, I realize I need to connect these percentages properly. The **45.7%** applies only to those who think rats carry diseases, so I need to find out how many people that represents.\n\nLet me jot down what I think:\n\n- **Proportion of Mistaken People:**  \n  \\( 45.7\\% \\times \\text{(People Who Think Rats Carry Diseases)} = 21 \\)\n\nHmm... So, if 21 people represent **45.7%** of the group, then the total number of people who think rats carry diseases is:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Thinking Rats Carry Diseases} = \\frac{21}{0.457} \n\\]\n\nBut **wait**, I need the total number of surveyed people, not just those who think rats carry diseases. So I might be heading in the wrong direction.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nMaybe I need to approach it differently\u2014perhaps find the total surveyed by considering the percentages leading to the 21 mistaken people.\n\n### **Step 2: Connect the 86.8% and 45.7%**\n\nOkay, let's think about it:\n\n- **Total Surveyed People (\\(T\\)):**  \n  - \\(86.8\\%\\) of \\(T\\) thought rats carried diseases.\n  \n- **Of Those \\(86.8\\%\\):**  \n  - \\(45.7\\%\\) think rats frequently carry rabies.\n  \n- **And Out of These:**  \n  - 21 people are mistaken about rats frequently carrying rabies.\n\n**Hmm...** This suggests a multi-layer percentage calculation. I need to set up equations that relate these percentages to the total surveyed.\n\n### **Step 3: Set Up the Equations**\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- **Total Surveyed People (\\(T\\))**\n- **People Who Think Rats Carry Diseases:**  \n  \\(0.868 \\times T\\)\n  \n- **People Who Think Rats Frequently Carry Rabies:**  \n  \\(0.457 \\times (0.868 \\times T) = 0.396996 \\times T\\)  \n  *(Since \\(0.457 \\times 0.868 \\approx 0.396996\\))*\n  \n- **Mistaken People (Don't Actually Carry Rabies):**  \n  21 people\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis setup makes sense. The 21 mistaken people represent those who think rats frequently carry rabies, which is part of the \\(0.396996 \\times T\\) group. Now, I can use this relationship to find \\(T\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Solving for \\(T\\)**\n\nGiven that **21 people** are part of the **\\(0.396996 \\times T\\)** group, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.396996 \\times T = 21\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(T\\):**\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{21}{0.396996} \\approx 52.9\n\\]\n\n**Wait a second...** The total surveyed \\(T\\) comes out to approximately **52.9**, but that doesn't make sense because the number of people should be a whole number. **Hmm,** maybe I should round it to the nearest whole number since it's about surveying people.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBut let me double-check. The problem asks for the total number of people surveyed, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent. So, perhaps rounding to the nearest whole number makes sense here.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nT \\approx 53\n\\]\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**\n\n- **Total Surveyed:**  \n  53 people\n  \n- **People Who Think Rats Carry Diseases:**  \n  \\(0.868 \\times 53 \\approx 46\\) people\n  \n- **People Who Think Rats Frequently Carry Rabies:**  \n  \\(0.457 \\times 46 \\approx 21\\) people\n  \n- **Mistaken People:**  \n  21 people (matches the given)\n\n**Hmm...** The numbers check out. The calculations align with the given data, and the total surveyed (\\(T \\approx 53\\)) is a reasonable whole number. **Ah!** This suggests that the approach is correct.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Proportional Relationships**\n\nJust to ensure the robustness of the solution, let me consider another approach.\n\n**Proportional Relationships:**\n\n- The **21 mistaken people** represent **45.7%** of those who think rats carry diseases.\n- Therefore, to find the total number surveyed, you can backtrack using the proportions.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Find the Number of People Who Think Rats Carry Diseases:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{People Who Think Rats Carry Diseases} = \\frac{21}{0.457} \\approx 46\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Find the Total Surveyed:**\n\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{46}{0.868} \\approx 53\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**  \nThis alternative approach also leads to the same total (\\(T \\approx 53\\)), confirming the correctness of the initial method.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully exploring different strategies, setting up equations, and checking the calculations, the total number of people John surveyed is **53**.\n\n---\n\nBy treating the problem step by step, reflecting on each part, and ensuring consistency through alternative methods, I've arrived at a reliable solution. This process also highlights the importance of verifying each stage to ensure accuracy, especially in percentage-related problems.",

  "ground_truth": "The problem tells us that $45.7 \\% $ of the people who think rats carry diseases equates to $21$ people total. If the total number of people who think that rats carry diseases is $x$, then we solve for $x$ as follows: $0.457x = 21$, so $x = 45.95$. However, we know that $x$ must be an integer, so rounding up, we get $x=46.$ Now, these $46$ people represent $86.8 \\%$ of the total number of people surveyed. So, if we let $y$ be the total number of people surveyed, we can solve for $y$ as follows: $0.868y = 46$, so $y = 52.995$. Rounding up, we get that John surveyed $\\boxed{53}$ total people."
