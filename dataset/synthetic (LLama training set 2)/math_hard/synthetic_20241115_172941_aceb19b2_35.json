I'll walk through my thought process step by step, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting if they make sense, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it manually.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question: **\"How many distinct four-digit numbers are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits?\"**\n\n- **Four-digit numbers:** Okay, so we're dealing with numbers from 1000 to 9999.\n- **Divisible by 3:** I remember that for a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. I'll keep this in mind.\n- **Last two digits are 23:** This is specific! It means the number ends with 23, so the first two digits can vary.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**  \n- This reminds me of problems where you need to find numbers within a certain range with specific divisibility rules.\n- I'm not sure how to approach it right away, but I know checking the divisibility by 3 will be essential.\n- Maybe I can start by setting up the general form of the number and see how the divisibility condition applies.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Problem**\n\nLet\u2019s brainstorm how to represent these four-digit numbers:\n\n- A four-digit number with 23 as the last two digits can be written as:  \n  **\\( \\text{AB}23 \\)**  \n  Here, A and B are digits, and A cannot be 0 (since it's a four-digit number).\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n- **Fixing the Last Two Digits:** Since the last two digits are fixed as 23, I only need to vary the first two digits (A and B).\n- **Checking Divisibility by 3:** Once I have the form \\( \\text{AB}23 \\), I can apply the divisibility rule for 3.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems like a valid starting point. By fixing the last two digits, I reduce the problem to finding suitable combinations for A and B that satisfy the divisibility condition.\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Divisibility by 3 Rule**\n\nNow, let's apply the divisibility rule for 3:\n\n- For \\( \\text{AB}23 \\) to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\n- The sum of the digits is:  \n  **\\( A + B + 2 + 3 = A + B + 5 \\)**  \n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- Wait, \\( A + B + 5 \\) needs to be divisible by 3. But how do I find all combinations of A and B that make this true?\n- Maybe I can list out possible values of \\( A + B \\) and see which ones work.\n\n**Exploring Further:**  \n- **List of A + B Values:** Since A and B are digits, \\( A + B \\) can range from 0 to 18.\n- **Divisibility Check:** I need to see which of these, when 5 is added, are divisible by 3.\n\n**Checking if the Approach Makes Sense:**  \n- This seems logical because if \\( A + B + 5 \\) is divisible by 3, then \\( A + B \\) must satisfy a specific condition.\n- I'm on the right track, but let's verify with a few examples to be sure.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with Examples**\n\nLet\u2019s take some sample values for A and B to see if the approach works:\n\n- **Example 1:**  \n  - Let\u2019s say \\( A = 1 \\), \\( B = 0 \\)  \n  - Number: 1023  \n  - Sum of digits: \\( 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 6 \\) (divisible by 3)  \n  - **Reflection:** This works!\n\n- **Example 2:**  \n  - \\( A = 2 \\), \\( B = 5 \\)  \n  - Number: 2523  \n  - Sum of digits: \\( 2 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 12 \\) (divisible by 3)  \n  - **Reflection:** This also works!\n\n**Checking the Method:**  \n- These examples confirm that the method might be correct. But to be sure, I should calculate all possible A and B combinations.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating Total Valid Combinations**\n\nLet\u2019s calculate how many combinations of A and B satisfy the condition:\n\n- **Range for A:** 1 to 9 (since A cannot be 0)\n- **Range for B:** 0 to 9\n\n**Total Combinations:**  \nThere are \\( 9 \\times 10 = 90 \\) possible combinations of A and B.\n\n**But wait:**  \n- Not all of these will satisfy the divisibility by 3 condition.\n- I need to filter out the combinations where \\( A + B + 5 \\) is not divisible by 3.\n\n**Thinking it Through:**  \n- This is getting a bit abstract. Maybe I can simplify by counting only the valid combinations instead of calculating all 90.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \n- Instead of listing all combinations, I can calculate how many A and B pairs satisfy the divisibility condition using modular arithmetic.\n\n### **Step 5: Simplifying with Modular Arithmetic**\n\nLet\u2019s use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem:\n\n- **Condition:**  \n  \\( A + B + 5 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\)  \n  Which simplifies to:  \n  \\( A + B \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\)  \n  (Because adding 5 is equivalent to adding 2 modulo 3)\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- Wait, so now I need to find all combinations where \\( A + B \\) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.\n- This sounds more straightforward!\n\n### **Step 6: Listing Valid A and B Combinations**\n\nLet\u2019s list all possible values of \\( A + B \\) and see which ones leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3:\n\n- **Possible \\( A + B \\) values:**  \n  - Minimum: \\( 1 + 0 = 1 \\)  \n  - Maximum: \\( 9 + 9 = 18 \\)  \n\n- **\\( A + B \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\):**  \n  - Valid sums: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16  \n\n**Reflection:**  \n- That makes sense because these sums, when 5 is added, result in numbers divisible by 3.\n\n### **Step 7: Counting Valid Combinations for Each Sum**\n\nNow, let's count how many combinations of A and B yield each of these valid sums:\n\n- **Sum = 1:**  \n  - \\( A = 1 \\), \\( B = 0 \\)  \n  - **Total:** 1 combination\n\n- **Sum = 4:**  \n  - \\( A = 1 \\), \\( B = 3 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 2 \\), \\( B = 2 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 3 \\), \\( B = 1 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 0 \\)  \n  - **Total:** 4 combinations\n\n- **Sum = 7:**  \n  - \\( A = 1 \\), \\( B = 6 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 2 \\), \\( B = 5 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 3 \\), \\( B = 4 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 3 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 5 \\), \\( B = 2 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 6 \\), \\( B = 1 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 7 \\), \\( B = 0 \\)  \n  - **Total:** 7 combinations\n\n- **Sum = 10:**  \n  - \\( A = 1 \\), \\( B = 9 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 2 \\), \\( B = 8 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 3 \\), \\( B = 7 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 6 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 5 \\), \\( B = 5 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 6 \\), \\( B = 4 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 7 \\), \\( B = 3 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 8 \\), \\( B = 2 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 9 \\), \\( B = 1 \\)  \n  - **Total:** 9 combinations\n\n- **Sum = 13:**  \n  - \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 9 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 5 \\), \\( B = 8 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 6 \\), \\( B = 7 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 7 \\), \\( B = 6 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 8 \\), \\( B = 5 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 9 \\), \\( B = 4 \\)  \n  - **Total:** 6 combinations\n\n- **Sum = 16:**  \n  - \\( A = 7 \\), \\( B = 9 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 8 \\), \\( B = 8 \\)  \n  - \\( A = 9 \\), \\( B = 7 \\)  \n  - **Total:** 3 combinations\n\n**Summing Up the Valid Combinations:**  \n- Sum = 1: 1  \n- Sum = 4: 4  \n- Sum = 7: 7  \n- Sum = 10: 9  \n- Sum = 13: 6  \n- Sum = 16: 3  \n- **Total:** \\( 1 + 4 + 7 + 9 + 6 + 3 = 30 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This seems correct because I\u2019ve accounted for all possible A and B combinations that satisfy the divisibility condition.\n- **Wait a second:** Does this total make sense? Initially, it feels a bit low given there are 90 total combinations, but let's proceed and see if it checks out with a quick verification.\n\n### **Step 8: Quick Verification**\n\nLet me quickly verify if this makes sense:\n\n- **Total possible combinations:** 90  \n- **Valid combinations found:** 30  \n- **Percentage of valid combinations:** \\( \\frac{30}{90} \\times 100 = 33.33\\% \\)  \n\n**Thinking it Through:**  \n- A third of the total combinations being valid seems plausible.\n- **But wait:** Just to be sure, I'll check if each sum category adds up correctly.\n\n**Checking Sum Categories:**\n- Sum = 1: 1 combination \u2705\n- Sum = 4: 4 combinations \u2705\n- Sum = 7: 7 combinations \u2705\n- Sum = 10: 9 combinations \u2705\n- Sum = 13: 6 combinations \u2705\n- Sum = 16: 3 combinations \u2705\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- All sum categories seem to add up correctly.\n- **Reflection:** So, the total of 30 valid combinations likely is correct.\n\n### **Step 9: Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully walking through each step, verifying, and reflecting on the approach, the **total number of distinct four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits is **30**.\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Brainstorming and Exploring Strategies:**  \n  Initially, I considered setting up the problem by fixing the last two digits and applying the divisibility rule for 3. Reflecting on this led me to simplify the problem using modular arithmetic, which proved to be an effective strategy.\n\n- **Checking and Adjusting the Approach:**  \n  Along the way, I verified my method with sample combinations and ensured that the total number of valid combinations made sense relative to the total possible combinations.\n\n- **Quick Verification:**  \n  A quick check confirmed that the distribution of valid combinations across different sum categories added up correctly, reinforcing the accuracy of the final answer.\n\n**In Summary:**  \nBy systematically breaking down the problem, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the calculations, I arrived at the correct solution: **30 distinct four-digit numbers** that meet the given criteria.",
