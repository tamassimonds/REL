    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step-by-step, just like I would if I were solving it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the problem states:\n- **Triangle \\( ABC \\)** is **isosceles** with side lengths **25 cm, 25 cm, and 48 cm**.\n- **Find the area** of triangle \\( ABC \\) in square centimeters.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- Isosceles triangles have at least two sides of equal length. Here, the sides are **25, 25,** and **48 cm**, so the two **25 cm** sides are equal.\n- The **base** would be the **48 cm** side, and the **25 cm** sides are the **legs**.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Use Heron's Formula:** This is a method to calculate the area of any triangle when you know all three side lengths.\n2. **Coordinate Geometry:** Place the triangle on a coordinate plane to calculate the area using the vertices' coordinates.\n3. **Pythagorean Theorem:** Since it's isosceles, maybe drop an altitude to the base to create two right triangles, which could help calculate the height and then the area.\n4. **Trigonometric Methods:** Use sine to find the area if angles are involved (though we don't have them directly here).\n\nAt first glance, **Heron's Formula** or dropping an **altitude** and using the **Pythagorean Theorem** seem like viable options because we have all sides' lengths or can easily find the height.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Heron's Formula** would involve calculating the semi-perimeter first, which is straightforward but might be more work than necessary.\n- **Dropping an altitude** seems intuitive for finding the area since it's an isosceles triangle, and we can easily find the height relative to the base.\n\n**Decision:**\nI think dropping an **altitude** to the base (**48 cm**) is the most direct approach. Let's try that and see if it works.\n\n### **Step 1: Dropping an Altitude**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- By dropping an altitude from the vertex opposite the base to the midpoint of the base, I create two **right triangles**.\n- This altitude will bisect the **48 cm base**, making it **24 cm** on each side.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let's label the triangle:\n  - \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are the endpoints of the base, so \\( AB = 48 \\) cm.\n  - \\( C \\) is the opposite vertex with \\( AC = BC = 25 \\) cm.\n  - Let \\( D \\) be the foot of the altitude from \\( C \\) to \\( AB \\), so \\( AD = DB = 24 \\) cm.\n\n- Now, in right triangle \\( ACD \\):\n  - \\( AC = 25 \\) cm (leg),\n  - \\( AD = 24 \\) cm (half the base),\n  - Let \\( h \\) be the altitude \\( CD \\).\n\n**Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n\\[\nAC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2 \n\\]\n\\[\n25^2 = 24^2 + h^2 \n\\]\n\\[\n625 = 576 + h^2 \n\\]\n\\[\nh^2 = 625 - 576 = 49 \n\\]\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{49} = 7 \\text{ cm} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, that height **7 cm** seems reasonable for an isosceles triangle with a **48 cm base** and **25 cm legs**.\n- The calculations follow logically, and the numbers make sense.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Area**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now that I have the height, I can use the area formula for a triangle:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \n\\]\n- The base is **48 cm**, and the height is **7 cm**.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 48 \\times 7 = 24 \\times 7 = 168 \n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 168 \\text{ square centimeters} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **168 square centimeters** for the area feels plausible.\n- To verify, let's briefly consider an alternative method to ensure consistency.\n\n### **Step 3: Alternative Verification Using Heron's Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since I used one method already, let's check the result using **Heron's Formula** to see if we get the same area.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- First, calculate the **semi-perimeter** \\( s \\):\n\\[\ns = \\frac{25 + 25 + 48}{2} = \\frac{98}{2} = 49 \\text{ cm} \n\\]\n\n- Now, apply Heron's Formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{49 \\times (49 - 25) \\times (49 - 25) \\times (49 - 48)} \n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{49 \\times 24 \\times 24 \\times 1} \n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{49 \\times 576} \n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{49} \\times \\sqrt{576} \n\\]\n\\[\n= 7 \\times 24 = 168 \\text{ square centimeters} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both methods yield the same area: **168 square centimeters**.\n- This consistency adds confidence that the solution is correct.\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Initially, I considered multiple strategies and settled on dropping an altitude because it seemed straightforward for an isosceles triangle.\n- After calculating the height and finding the area, I verified the result using Heron's Formula as an alternative approach.\n\n**Check:**\n- The height calculation using the Pythagorean Theorem makes sense and aligns with the properties of the triangle.\n- The area calculations using both methods agree, confirming the correctness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- By exploring different strategies and verifying the result through multiple methods, I've ensured that the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is **168 square centimeters**.\n\nThroughout this process, I brainstormed various approaches, reflected on each step, checked calculations, and confirmed the result using an alternative method to ensure accuracy and correctness.",

Thus, $AD=\\frac{48}{2}=24$. Now we see $ABD$ is a 7-24-25 right triangle, so $BD=7$. Calculating the area of $ABC$, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 48 \\cdot 7=24 \\cdot 7=\\boxed{168} \\text{sq cm}$."
